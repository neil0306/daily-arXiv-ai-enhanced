This paper presents a\nnovel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with\nthe following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class\ntransitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided\napproach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can\nenhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a\nmulti-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change\nclassification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),\nand change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.\nThird, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel\nspatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to\nimprove Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and\ndeformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS\ntime-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on\nland-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%\ngains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%\nimprovements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "KAMamba is a novel knowledge-aware Mamba model for MODIS change detection that addresses mixed pixels, information coupling, and background heterogeneity through knowledge-driven transitions, multi-task learning, and specialized Mamba modules.", "motivation": "MODIS change detection faces challenges including mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information coupling effects, and background class heterogeneity, which limit detection accuracy.", "method": "Proposes KAMamba with: 1) Knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided approach with KAT-loss, 2) Multi-task learning with PreC-loss, PostC-loss, and Chg-loss, 3) SSTMamba modules to disentangle information coupling, 4) SDMamba backbone for efficiency.", "result": "On MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada: 1.5-6% gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.", "conclusion": "KAMamba effectively addresses MODIS change detection challenges through knowledge-aware transitions, multi-task learning, and specialized Mamba architectures, achieving significant performance improvements."}}

Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity\naccelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech\ndatasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed\nfrom different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic\nstyles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate\nspeech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to\ndata-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to\naccount for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.\nRV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on\ndistinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework\nemploys reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the\ncontribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then\naggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two\nprimary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the\ndetection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides\ninterpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.\nConsequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and\nachieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods.
