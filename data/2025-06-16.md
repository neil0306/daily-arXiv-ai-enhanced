*Yanyan Wang,Yingying Wang,Junli Liang,Yin Xu,Yunlong Liu,Yiming Xu,Zhengwang Jiang,Zhehe Li,Fei Li,Long Zhao,Kuang Xu,Qi Song,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleEval-OS, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling, covering 15 datasets across 13 subtasks. It assesses 14 LLMs, showing open-source models can outperform closed-source ones in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and lack of benchmarks for LLMs in telecommunications operation scheduling hinder their potential application in this domain.

Method: Proposes TeleEval-OS, a benchmark with 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, simulating four operational stages. Evaluates 10 open-source and 4 closed-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot methods.

Result: Open-source LLMs outperform closed-source ones in specific scenarios, demonstrating their potential in telecommunications operation scheduling.

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS fills a critical research gap, showcasing the value of LLMs in telecommunications and highlighting open-source models' competitive edge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

### [2] [Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11063)
*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Yuyao Ge,Zhecheng Li,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates position bias in multimodal RAG systems, revealing a U-shaped accuracy curve and introducing metrics to quantify and visualize this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG models are sensitive to evidence order, leading to unstable performance and biased reasoning, especially with increased retrieval complexity or modality diversity.

Method: Controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, introducing the Position Sensitivity Index (PSI_p) and a visualization framework for attention patterns.

Result: Multimodal interactions intensify position bias, which increases logarithmically with retrieval range.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for position-aware strategies like evidence reordering or debiasing to improve RAG system reliability and fairness.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

*Alexey Tikhonov,Sergei Shteiner,Anna Bykova,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of Russenorsk lexicon using LLMs, constructing a dictionary, testing hypotheses, and creating a translation agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the linguistic principles of Russenorsk, a pidgin language, using modern tools.

Method: Use LLMs to analyze literary sources, build a structured dictionary, test word formation hypotheses, and develop a translation agent.

Result: Generated hypotheses align with academic literature; a translation agent for Russenorsk was created.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for studying historical pidgin languages, offering new insights and tools.

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

*Hieu Nghiem,Hemanth Reddy Singareddy,Zhuqi Miao,Jivan Lamichhane,Abdulaziz Ahmed,Johnson Thomas,Dursun Delen,William Paiva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A cost-effective LLM-based pipeline for extracting ROS entities from clinical notes, using open-source and commercial LLMs, achieves low error rates and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the burden of ROS documentation in healthcare by automating extraction with LLMs.

Method: Pipeline uses SecTag for ROS section extraction and few-shot LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma, ChatGPT) for entity span, status, and body system identification.

Result: ChatGPT achieved lowest error rates (28.2% for spans, 14.5% for status/systems). Open-source LLMs showed promising performance (30.5-36.7% for spans, 24.3-27.3% for status/systems).

Conclusion: The pipeline is scalable and deployable locally, with open-source LLMs as viable alternatives in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [5] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB), judging non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts include modal expressions like 'must' or 'ought to'. A mitigation strategy using few-shot examples and reasoning prompts is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how LLMs handle moral and ethical reasoning, particularly in judging obligations, an underexplored area in LLM alignment research.

Method: The work identifies DKB by analyzing LLM responses to prompts with modal expressions. It tests this bias across various LLM families, question types, and answer formats.

Result: LLMs judge over 90% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are present, showing consistent DKB.

Conclusion: The study highlights the influence of linguistic framing on LLM judgments and proposes a strategy to mitigate DKB, emphasizing the need for bias-aware alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

### [6] [Targeted control of fast prototyping through domain-specific interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11070)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interface architecture to bridge the gap between natural language instructions and modeling languages for precise control of prototype models using Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial designers need intuitive ways to control prototype models with natural language, avoiding complex modeling commands. Current Large Language Models underutilize this potential due to language gaps.

Method: The authors develop an interface architecture based on design principles from fast prototyping practices, including an algorithm for automated domain specification.

Result: Evaluations show the interface enables precise and effective control of prototype models, acting as an auxiliary module for Large Language Models.

Conclusion: The proposed interface successfully bridges language gaps, enhancing the usability of Large Language Models for industrial design prototyping.

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [7] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye,Qiming Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Libo Qin,Yichong Huang,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yang Xiang,Zhirui Zhang,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM is a near training-free method to reduce multilingual object hallucination in LVLMs by aligning cross-modal attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit higher object hallucination in non-English languages, and existing solutions are resource-intensive.

Method: CLAIM identifies language-specific attention heads, estimates language shift vectors, and intervenes during inference.

Result: CLAIM improves performance by 13.56% on POPE and 21.75% on MME benchmark subsets.

Conclusion: Multilingual attention divergence is prominent in intermediate layers, emphasizing their role in multilingual scenarios.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

### [8] [CyclicReflex: Improving Large Reasoning Models via Cyclical Reflection Token Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11077)
*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyclicReflex, a method to dynamically regulate reflection tokens in large reasoning models (LRMs) to optimize performance, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation caused by improper use of reflection tokens (over-reflection or under-reflection) in LRMs during multi-step reasoning.

Method: Proposes cyclical reflection token scheduling (CyclicReflex), which dynamically adjusts reflection token logits using a triangular waveform.

Result: CyclicReflex improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B) on benchmarks like MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023.

Conclusion: CyclicReflex effectively manages reflection token allocation, enhancing LRM performance and outperforming standard and recent decoding strategies.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

### [9] [RoE-FND: A Case-Based Reasoning Approach with Dual Verification for Fake News Detection via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11078)
*Yuzhou Yang,Yangming Zhou,Zhiying Zhu,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoE-FND is a framework combining LLMs and experiential learning for fake news detection, addressing noise, generalization, and bias by using self-reflective knowledge building and dynamic criterion retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detection methods suffer from noisy evidence, poor generalization, and unclear decisions. LLMs introduce issues like hallucinated rationales and bias.

Method: RoE-FND uses two stages: self-reflective knowledge building (analyzing past errors) and dynamic criterion retrieval (synthesizing reasoning guidelines). It cross-checks rationales via a dual-channel procedure.

Result: Empirical validation shows RoE-FND outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization and effectiveness across three datasets.

Conclusion: RoE-FND offers a training-free, adaptable solution for fake news detection, improving robustness and decision clarity.

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

*Han Zhou,Qitong Xu,Yiheng Dong,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MANBench is a bilingual benchmark evaluating MLLMs against human performance in multimodal tasks, revealing gaps in cross-modal reasoning and complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether MLLMs can surpass human performance in multimodal tasks and identify their limitations.

Method: Developed MANBench, a benchmark with 1,314 questions across nine tasks, and compared human and MLLM performance.

Result: MLLMs excel in knowledge-based tasks but struggle with cross-modal reasoning and complex tasks like puzzles.

Conclusion: MANBench underscores MLLMs' limitations and aims to inspire improvements to bridge the gap with human capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a method using LLMs to generate Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) from natural language specifications, improving grammar validity and test effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating valid and general grammars from natural language specifications is challenging, especially with limited supervision.

Method: The approach fine-tunes an LLM for specification-to-grammar translation and uses GRPO for grammar enhancement, with iterative feedback for error correction.

Result: SAGE outperforms 17 LLMs, improving grammar validity by 15.92%p and test effectiveness by 12.34%p.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong generalization and effectiveness in grammar generation, advancing the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

*Lionel Levine,John Santerre,Alex S. Young,T. Barry Levine,Francis Campion,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a transformer-based model for sequential clinical decision-making, outperforming baselines in predicting next steps in patient diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical decision-making by modeling sequential patient data and predicting diagnostic pathways.

Method: Uses a transformer architecture with tokenized clinical events and autoregressive training.

Result: Shows significant improvements in next-token prediction, generating realistic diagnostic sequences.

Conclusion: PRISM bridges ML and real-world diagnostics, enabling support for clinical decisions, simulations, and education.

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate is a multi-agent debate framework using adversarial LLMs to identify and mitigate unsafe behaviors, reducing risks by up to 23.5% without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety methods rely on costly human evaluations or single-model assessments, lacking scalability and risking oversight.

Method: RedDebate employs adversarial argumentation among LLMs, integrating long-term memory to retain safety insights from debates.

Result: Debates alone reduce unsafe behaviors by 17.7%, and with memory modules, reductions exceed 23.5%.

Conclusion: RedDebate is the first fully automated framework combining multi-agent debates and red-teaming to enhance AI safety.

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

*Pengbo Wang,Chaozhuo Li,Chenxu Wang,Liwen Zheng,Litian Zhang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPACE is a unified framework addressing factuality and faithfulness hallucinations in LLMs by editing shared activation subspaces, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from factuality and faithfulness hallucinations, with current methods creating trade-offs between the two.

Method: SPACE jointly mitigates both hallucination types by identifying and editing shared activation subspaces using dual-task feature modeling and a hybrid probe strategy.

Result: SPACE outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SPACE provides a unified solution to mitigate overlapping hallucination types in LLMs, improving their practical deployment.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

*Shaoshi Ling,Guoli Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach using LLM feedback improves ASR performance on rare named entities and domain mismatches, outperforming self-training by 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with rare named entities and domain mismatches, while LLMs excel across domains, motivating their use for adaptation.

Method: Proposes reinforcement learning with LLM feedback to score ASR hypotheses and fine-tune the model using these scores as rewards.

Result: Achieves a 21% improvement in entity word error rate over conventional self-training methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs for unsupervised domain adaptation significantly enhances ASR performance, especially for rare named entities.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

*Jubin Abhishek Soni,Amit Anand,Rajesh Kumar Pandey,Aniket Abhishek Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCT extends RAG for dynamic, multi-turn interactions, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are static and unsuitable for dynamic domains like healthcare and smart homes.

Method: DCT uses an attention-based context cache, LoRA-based retrieval, and context compression to adapt to evolving tools and contexts.

Result: DCT improves plan accuracy by 14%, reduces hallucinations by 37%, and matches GPT-4 at lower cost.

Conclusion: DCT enables scalable, adaptable AI assistants in dynamic environments, even with unseen tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

*Songyang Liu,Chaozhuo Li,Jiameng Qiu,Xi Zhang,Feiran Huang,Litian Zhang,Yiming Hei,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey provides a systematic review of safety evaluations for Large Language Models (LLMs), covering motivations, tasks, metrics, methods, and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid deployment of LLMs has raised safety concerns due to issues like toxicity and bias, necessitating a comprehensive review of evaluation efforts.

Method: The survey categorizes safety evaluation into four aspects: why, what, where, and how to evaluate, including tasks, metrics, datasets, and methods.

Result: It highlights the importance of safety evaluation and identifies gaps in current research, proposing future directions.

Conclusion: Prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation is crucial for their safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

*Manuel D. S. Hopp,Vincent Labatut,Arthur Amalvy,Richard Dufour,Hannah Stone,Hayley Jach,Kou Murayama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to model reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps in text, using BERTopic and persistent homology, and validates it with empirical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reader curiosity is crucial for engagement but underexplored in NLP. The study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging Information Gap Theory.

Method: The approach uses BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze a dynamic semantic network, treating topological features as proxies for information gaps.

Result: The pipeline significantly improves curiosity prediction (73% vs. 30% explained deviance) compared to a baseline, validated with reader ratings.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel computational method to analyze text structure and its impact on reader engagement.

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

### [19] [C-SEO Bench: Does Conversational SEO Work?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11097)
*Haritz Puerto,Martin Gubri,Tommaso Green,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-SEO Bench, a benchmark for evaluating Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO) methods across tasks, domains, and actors, revealing current methods' ineffectiveness compared to traditional SEO strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about the effectiveness of C-SEO methods across diverse domains and multi-actor competitive scenarios.

Method: Developed C-SEO Bench, evaluating C-SEO methods for question answering and product recommendation tasks across three domains, with varying adoption rates.

Result: Most current C-SEO methods are ineffective; traditional SEO strategies outperform them. Gains diminish as more actors adopt C-SEO, indicating a zero-sum problem.

Conclusion: C-SEO Bench highlights the limitations of current C-SEO methods and the superiority of traditional SEO in LLM contexts, emphasizing the need for broader evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to differentiate AI agents from LLM chatbots, categorizes evaluation benchmarks, and provides guidance for selecting benchmarks in AI agent research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks confuse distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, hindering benchmark selection.

Method: Systematic analysis of evaluation approaches, categorization of benchmarks, and synthesis of trends through four lenses.

Result: A detailed framework differentiating AI agents from LLM chatbots and practical reference tables for benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study aids researchers in benchmark selection, advancing AI agent evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

### [21] [You Only Fine-tune Once: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-Tuning for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11103)
*Wenchong He,Liqian Peng,Zhe Jiang,Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL) improves performance of large language models by treating in-context examples as training targets, closing the gap with dedicated fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance gap between in-context learning (ICL) and dedicated fine-tuning, and to mitigate inefficiencies in processing long sequences with many examples.

Method: Proposes ManyICL, extending ICL to a many-shot setting with a novel training objective where every in-context answer is a supervised target.

Result: ManyICL outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning, approaches dedicated fine-tuning performance, and reduces catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: ManyICL is a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance without task-specific fine-tuning, offering efficiency and reduced forgetting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

*Hanzhi Zhang,Heng Fan,Kewei Sha,Yan Huang,Yunhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAM, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism for transformers, addressing efficiency and adaptability issues in long-context NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' quadratic self-attention complexity and static sparse attention methods' limitations in capturing heterogeneous patterns motivate the need for an adaptive solution.

Method: DAM dynamically assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map level, preserving heterogeneous patterns without predefined structures or fine-tuning.

Result: DAM aligns closely with full-attention models, reducing memory and compute overhead while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: DAM offers a scalable, efficient alternative to full attention, enabling practical deployment of large-scale LLMs without compromising retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel medical assistant system compresses LLMs for edge devices using neuron pruning and quantization, achieving real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are too large for resource-constrained healthcare environments like edge devices.

Method: Uses neuron saliency-based pruning and post-training quantization to reduce model size.

Result: Achieves 50-67% compression on Gemma and LLaMA3, with real-time inference on low-power devices.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient LLM deployment in specialized domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

*Ningyuan Li,Junrui Liu,Yi Shan,Minghui Huang,Tong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PankRAG improves RAG by addressing entity-level extraction flaws with hierarchical query-resolution and dependency-aware reranking, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods rely on entity extraction, risking misinterpretation and irrelevant retrievals, leading to poor response fidelity.

Method: PankRAG uses hierarchical query-resolution and dependency-aware reranking to structure reasoning and validate retrievals.

Result: PankRAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks, showing robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: PankRAG enhances retrieval and generation fidelity by addressing dependencies and hierarchical query resolution.

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multi-turn dialogue and chain-of-thought reasoning by leveraging attention mechanisms and self-supervised rewards.

Method: Implemented on vLLM runtime, capturing cross-attention weights and generalizing rewards for conversation histories and reasoning steps.

Result: Proposed an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent attention collapse and outlined future directions.

Conclusion: The extension shows promise for complex tasks like multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

*Yile Chen,Yicheng Tao,Yue Jiang,Shuai Liu,Han Yu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QT-Mob enhances LLMs for mobility analytics by improving location tokenization and fine-tuning objectives, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic location representation and mobility signal modeling in LLMs.

Method: QT-Mob introduces a location tokenization module and complementary fine-tuning objectives.

Result: Superior performance in next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: QT-Mob provides a generalizable and effective approach for mobility analytics.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench evaluates LLMs' consistency in factual evaluation despite directional framing of statements, aiming to measure their ability to maintain truth evaluation regardless of user assertions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how directional framing of true statements influences LLM agreement, a common user scenario.

Method: Sampling evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, constructing opposing framing prompts (correct vs. incorrect), and recording model agreement and reasoning.

Result: Benchmark isolates framing-induced variability from factual knowledge, stratifying results based on neutral claim accuracy.

Conclusion: AssertBench measures LLMs' ability to consistently evaluate truth despite contradictory user assertions, with source code publicly available.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

TL;DR: A survey on the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, evaluation methods, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for robust LLMs in diverse applications by reviewing concepts, methods, and challenges in the field.

Method: The paper defines LLM robustness, organizes the survey into adversarial robustness, OOD robustness, and evaluation, and reviews representative works.

Result: Provides a comprehensive terminology, review of methods, and a GitHub repository for community support.

Conclusion: Highlights future opportunities and research directions for improving LLM robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of LLMs as automated peer reviewers, focusing on their vulnerability to adversarial attacks and comparing their performance to human reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of academic submissions burdens reviewers, and LLMs could assist, but their reliability under adversarial attacks is uncertain.

Method: The study evaluates LLM performance in peer review, tests their susceptibility to adversarial text manipulations, and explores mitigation strategies.

Result: LLMs show significant vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, which can distort their review assessments.

Conclusion: Addressing adversarial risks is crucial to ensure AI enhances, rather than undermines, scholarly communication integrity.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

*Yerim Oh,Jun-Hyung Park,Junho Kim,SungHo Kim,SangKeun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATTER is a novel tokenization method for materials science that integrates domain knowledge to prevent fragmentation and semantic loss, outperforming existing methods by 4% in generation and 2% in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization methods for language models in materials science cause excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, compromising structural and semantic integrity of material concepts.

Method: MATTER combines MatDetector (trained on a materials knowledge base) and a re-ranking method to prioritize material concepts during token merging, preserving structural and semantic integrity.

Result: MATTER achieves average performance gains of 4% in generation and 2% in classification tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Domain knowledge is crucial for effective tokenization in scientific text processing, as demonstrated by MATTER's superior performance.

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct is a high-quality instruction dataset designed to improve LLMs' foundational and chat capabilities, outperforming proprietary models like GPT-4 in some tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source instruction datasets are narrow in scope, limiting LLM generalization and widening the gap with proprietary models.

Method: A two-phase pipeline: Phase 1 curates 7.4M foundational instructions; Phase 2 synthesizes 1.5M chat instructions through selection, evolution, and filtering.

Result: Fine-tuned models (e.g., InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B) outperform GPT-4-0314 by 8.6% in instruction tasks and achieve comparable foundational performance.

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct bridges the gap with proprietary models, demonstrating the synergy between foundational and chat training for holistic LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

*Junyong Lin,Lu Dai,Ruiqian Han,Yijie Sui,Ruilin Wang,Xingliang Sun,Qinglin Wu,Min Feng,Hao Liu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScIRGen is a framework for generating scientific QA & retrieval datasets that better reflect real-world research needs, resulting in the 61k QA dataset ScIRGen-Geo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA datasets lack alignment with real-world scientific research inquiries, necessitating a more realistic dataset.

Method: Developed a dataset generation framework using dataset-oriented information extraction, cognitive taxonomy for question generation, and LLM perplexity shift for answer filtering.

Result: Created ScIRGen-Geo, a 61k QA dataset, and benchmarked methods, revealing limitations in handling complex questions.

Conclusion: ScIRGen advances tools for scientific research by addressing intricate information needs.

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

*Jingyu Li,Lingchao Mao,Hairong Wang,Zhendong Wang,Xi Mao,Xuelei Sherry Ni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks foundation models for early ADRD detection using speech and language features, finding ASR-derived embeddings most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is crucial, and speech markers offer non-invasive biomarkers.

Method: Used the PREPARE Challenge dataset with 1,600+ recordings, filtered to 703 HC, 81 MCI, and 405 AD cases. Benchmarked speech and language models for cognitive status classification.

Result: Whisper-medium (speech) and BERT (language) performed best. ASR-derived embeddings outperformed others, with pause patterns improving text-based classification.

Conclusion: Acoustic-based approaches, especially ASR embeddings, show promise for scalable, non-invasive ADRD detection.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

### [36] [SDMPrune: Self-Distillation MLP Pruning for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11120)
*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for compressing LLMs using self-distillation loss during pruning, focusing on MLP modules to reduce costs without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High deployment costs of LLMs and the need for effective compression methods that preserve generative capabilities.

Method: Introduces self-distillation loss during pruning to leverage original model predictions and focuses on pruning MLP modules for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing pruning methods on zero-shot benchmarks and achieves competitive performance among 1B-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively compresses LLMs while maintaining performance, with open-source code and weights available.

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

*Wei-Ping Huang,Guan-Ting Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUTA-LM combines TTA with language model rescoring to address performance drops in ASR due to domain mismatches, achieving robust results across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate performance drops in ASR caused by domain mismatches, the paper explores combining TTA with language model rescoring, identifying interference challenges.

Method: Proposes SUTA-LM, extending SUTA with controlled adaptation and auto-step selection, followed by language model rescoring.

Result: Experiments on 18 datasets show SUTA-LM achieves robust performance across diverse domains.

Conclusion: SUTA-LM effectively combines TTA and language model rescoring, addressing interference challenges for improved ASR performance.

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

*Freddie Grabovski,Gilad Gressel,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASRJam and EchoGuard are introduced as defenses against LLM-driven vishing scams, disrupting ASR transcription while preserving human call quality. EchoGuard outperforms other methods in usability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLM-powered vishing scams, which are scalable and convincing, necessitates proactive defenses targeting the vulnerable ASR transcription step.

Method: ASRJam injects adversarial perturbations into audio to disrupt ASR, while EchoGuard uses natural distortions like echo and reverberation for the same purpose. A 39-person study evaluated EchoGuard against other attacks.

Result: EchoGuard achieved the highest utility, balancing ASR disruption and human listening experience better than other methods.

Conclusion: EchoGuard is an effective and practical defense against vishing scams, outperforming existing adversarial audio techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

TL;DR: GUIRoboTron-Speech is an end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that uses speech instructions and screenshots for action prediction, addressing limitations of text-based GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility and convenience in hands-free scenarios by enabling speech-based interaction with GUI agents.

Method: Leverages TTS for dataset generation, progressive grounding and planning training, and a heuristic mixed-instruction strategy to address modality imbalance.

Result: Demonstrates robust and superior performance on benchmark datasets, validating speech as an effective instruction modality.

Conclusion: GUIRoboTron-Speech shows significant potential for widespread use of speech-driven GUI agents.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

*Andrew Keenan Richardson,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Sean Moss,Vincent Wang-Mascianica,Philipp Koralus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models' errors increasingly mirror human reasoning fallacies as they improve, challenging the idea that scaling leads to normative rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns, including biases and fallacies, as they advance in capability.

Method: Applied the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) using PyETR to generate tasks where humans predictably err, evaluating 38 models across 383 tasks.

Result: Advanced models show higher alignment of incorrect answers with human fallacies, independent of error rate ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$).

Conclusion: Scaling models doesn't ensure normative rationality; instead, they increasingly reflect human-like biases and limitations.

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder clinical use; CHECK aims to mitigate this by detecting and reducing factual and reasoning-based errors.

Method: CHECK combines structured clinical databases with an information-theory classifier to detect hallucinations, leveraging probabilities for model refinement.

Result: CHECK reduced hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% in LLama3.3-70B-Instruct and achieved AUCs of 0.95-0.96 on medical benchmarks, boosting USMLE performance to 92.1%.

Conclusion: CHECK provides a scalable solution for safe LLM deployment in high-stakes domains like medicine by suppressing hallucinations below clinical error thresholds.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

TL;DR: A self-refining framework improves ASR performance using unlabeled data by generating pseudo-labels, training a TTS system, and bootstrapping synthetic data into the ASR model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings without relying on labeled datasets.

Method: Generates pseudo-labels from unannotated speech, trains a TTS system, and uses synthesized speech-text pairs to refine the ASR model.

Result: Twister, the adapted model, reduces error rates by 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation, improving ASR performance in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

*David C. Krakauer,John W. Krakauer,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emergence in complex systems, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess if they exhibit emergent capabilities and intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs demonstrate emergent properties and intelligence, aligning with the principles of complexity science.

Method: Review and analyze approaches to quantifying emergence in LLMs, evaluating their capabilities and intelligence.

Result: The paper likely identifies evidence of emergent capabilities in LLMs but questions whether this translates to true emergent intelligence.

Conclusion: LLMs may show emergent properties, but further research is needed to confirm if these constitute genuine emergent intelligence.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for extracting and classifying medication discontinuations in EHR notes, finding GPT-4o and open-sourced models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct perform well, with few-shot learning improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medication discontinuation data in EHRs is often buried in unstructured notes, posing patient safety risks. The study aims to assess LLMs' scalability for this task without human annotation.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs on three EHR datasets, comparing performance on medication extraction, discontinuation classification, and joint tasks using various prompting strategies.

Result: GPT-4o led in zero-shot performance (94.0% F1 for extraction, 78.1% for classification). Open-sourced models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct also performed well. Few-shot learning improved results.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives. Few-shot learning enhances performance.

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

TL;DR: Small models (<1B parameters) remain competitive in BEA 2025 shared tasks despite limited computational resources, with performance gaps of 6.46 to 13.13 points compared to winners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that smaller models can perform competitively under resource constraints, reflecting conditions in the Global South.

Method: Used models with fewer than 1B parameters, designed to run on low-budget or no GPUs.

Result: Performance gaps ranged from 6.46 to 13.13 points across tracks, showing competitiveness.

Conclusion: Small models are viable for such tasks, even with limited computational power.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods operate on individual languages, missing the opportunity to transfer debiasing effects across languages via multilingual representations.

Conclusion: IMSAE provides a robust solution for multilingual debiasing, leveraging cross-lingual similarities for improved performance.

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

*Kushagra Dixit,Abhishek Rajgaria,Harshavardhan Kalalbandi,Dan Roth,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores prompting techniques for Temporal Table Reasoning in LLMs, introduces SEAR for adaptive prompting, and shows its superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting methods for table reasoning lack exploration of their impact, and performance varies widely across table types, necessitating an optimal, adaptive approach.

Method: Investigates multiple prompting techniques, introduces SEAR (an adaptive framework), and tests performance across diverse table types and structures.

Result: SEAR outperforms baselines across all table types; table structure refactoring (unified representation) improves reasoning.

Conclusion: SEAR's adaptive prompting is optimal for diverse table reasoning tasks, and unified table representations enhance performance.

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

*Liran Ringel,Elad Tolochinsky,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A learned continue-thinking token improves language model accuracy more than fixed tokens in test-time scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if a dedicated continue-thinking token can outperform fixed tokens in extending reasoning steps for better model performance.

Method: Augment a distilled DeepSeek-R1 model with a learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping other weights frozen.

Result: The learned token achieves a 4.2% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, outperforming the fixed-token approach (1.3% improvement).

Conclusion: A learned continue-thinking token is more effective than fixed tokens for enhancing reasoning and accuracy in language models.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curriculum learning in pretraining language models improves convergence and yields lasting gains, with compression ratio, lexical diversity, and readability as key difficulty signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underexplored potential of curriculum learning in pretraining language models.

Method: Experiments with vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula guided by six difficulty metrics.

Result: Consistent improvement in convergence and up to 3.5% performance gain; compression ratio, lexical diversity, and readability identified as effective signals.

Conclusion: Data ordering is crucial in pretraining, offering scalable and data-efficient model development insights.

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

### [50] [Don't Pay Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11305)
*Mohammad Hammoud,Devang Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Avey is a new neural architecture that avoids attention and recurrence, enabling efficient processing of long sequences while performing well on short-range NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face challenges with long sequences and quadratic attention complexity, while RNNs lack parallelism. Avey aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Avey uses a ranker and autoregressive neural processor to identify and contextualize relevant tokens, decoupling sequence length from context width.

Result: Avey performs comparably to Transformers on short-range tasks and excels at capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: Avey offers a promising alternative to Transformers and RNNs, addressing their key limitations.

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

*Yi-Chien Lin,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the relationship between Transformer-based models' perplexity and their surprisal estimates' predictive power on brain imaging data, confirming the trend observed in latency-based measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if the positive relationship between model perplexity and surprisal predictive power, observed in latency-based measures, also applies to neural measures like fMRI data.

Method: Evaluated surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer-based models across three language families on two fMRI datasets.

Result: The positive relationship between model perplexity and predictive power holds for neural measures, generalizing the trend beyond latency-based data.

Conclusion: The trend of higher perplexity models being less predictive of human processing difficulty extends to brain imaging data, suggesting broader applicability.

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

*Yaohui Zhang,Haijing Zhang,Wenlong Ji,Tianyu Hua,Nick Haber,Hancheng Cao,Weixin Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs for pairwise manuscript comparisons in peer review, showing improved accuracy over traditional methods but revealing biases in novelty and institutional representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new paradigms for peer review using LLMs beyond replicating traditional workflows, aiming for more accurate and robust manuscript evaluation.

Method: Employing LLM agents to conduct pairwise comparisons of manuscripts and aggregating results to measure relative quality, compared to traditional rating-based methods.

Result: The comparative approach outperforms traditional methods in identifying high-impact papers but introduces biases like reduced novelty and institutional imbalance.

Conclusion: While LLMs offer transformative potential for peer review, addressing emergent biases is critical for ensuring equity and diversity in future systems.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A text-based approach for Speaker Diarization (SD) using sentence-level speaker change detection in dialogues, outperforming audio-based methods in short conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-based SD systems struggle with audio quality and speaker similarity, prompting exploration of text-based alternatives.

Method: Developed two models: Single Prediction Model (SPM) and Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), using dialogue transcripts.

Result: Text-based SD, especially MPM, competes with audio-based systems, excelling in short conversations.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of linguistic features and semantic understanding in SD, suggesting future research in multimodal approaches.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to evaluate demographic biases in LLMs by assessing moral patient interventions, revealing baseline biases and willingness to help across demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in LLMs by quantitatively evaluating their demographic biases, focusing on gender, race, and age.

Method: Prompting models to assess moral patient interventions to measure biases, comparing baseline demographics (white middle-aged/young adult males) to others.

Result: Models generally view baseline demographics as white middle-aged/young adult males, but non-baseline demographics show more willingness to help.

Conclusion: The study provides tools to objectively assess LLM biases, helping users and developers account for or mitigate these biases in outputs or training.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Conclusion: The approach is robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor

adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across

replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and

### [56] [Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling for Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11389)
*Karanpartap Singh,Neil Band,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGLS improves pretraining efficiency by gradually adding layers and increasing data difficulty, outperforming baselines on benchmarks like PIQA and ARC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human cognitive development, CGLS aims to enhance learning efficiency in large language model pretraining by synchronizing model growth with data difficulty.

Method: CGLS uses progressive layer stacking and a curriculum transitioning from simpler to more complex data (e.g., synthetic stories to technical content).

Result: At 100M and 1.2B parameter scales, CGLS outperforms baselines on benchmarks, showing better generalization and zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: CGLS is a simple, effective strategy for improving generalization in knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Machine learning and LLMs were used to predict early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC) in patients under 45, achieving 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising incidence of EoCRC in younger populations, who are not covered by standard screening guidelines, necessitates better predictive tools.

Method: Applied 10 machine learning models and compared them with fine-tuned LLMs using patient data from 1,953 CRC cases.

Result: The fine-tuned LLM outperformed, with 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for EoCRC prediction, offering a potential tool for early detection in younger populations.

Abstract: The incidence rate of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC, age < 45) has
increased every year, but this population is younger than the recommended age
established by national guidelines for cancer screening. In this paper, we
applied 10 different machine learning models to predict EoCRC, and compared
their performance with advanced large language models (LLM), using patient
conditions, lab results, and observations within 6 months of patient journey
prior to the CRC diagnoses. We retrospectively identified 1,953 CRC patients
from multiple health systems across the United States. The results demonstrated
that the fine-tuned LLM achieved an average of 73% sensitivity and 91%
specificity.

TL;DR: Chelsea is a framework for online KV cache clustering in LLMs, reducing memory usage by 80% and speeding up inference by up to 3.19x with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLMs face deployment challenges due to high KV cache memory requirements, and existing solutions either discard critical information or lack efficiency.

Method: Chelsea uses Chunked Soft Matching to cluster KV cache by similarity, merging clusters into centroids, and includes theoretical analysis of partitioning.

Result: Chelsea reduces KV cache memory by 80%, speeds up decoding by 3.19x, and cuts latency by 2.72x while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Chelsea effectively addresses KV cache inefficiencies in LLMs, offering significant memory and speed improvements with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

*Jeff Da,Clinton Wang,Xiang Deng,Yuntao Ma,Nikhil Barhate,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR enhances RLVR for agentic tasks by introducing agent guidance, improving performance in software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RLVR fails in complex, multi-step agentic environments due to sparse rewards.

Method: Agent-RLVR incorporates agent guidance (e.g., strategic plans, feedback) to steer agents, validated by unit tests and updated via RLVR.

Result: Pass@1 performance improved from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified, further boosted to 27.8% with test-time reward model training.

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR enables effective RLVR in complex environments, advancing agent training beyond conventional RL limitations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and explore the potential of compact models against larger LLMs.

Method: Fine-tuned NLLB models with special language tokens, evaluated using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge" method.

Result: KoGEC outperformed GPT-4 and HCX-3, showing balanced error correction, especially for punctuation. Token vocabulary expansion reduced performance.

Conclusion: KoGEC provides an efficient Korean GEC solution, demonstrating task-specific models can compete with larger LLMs in specialized NLP tasks.

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AbsenceBench to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect missing information, revealing their limitations despite strong performance on tasks like NIAH.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capacity to identify omitted information, highlighting gaps in their understanding.

Method: AbsenceBench tests LLMs across three domains (numerical sequences, poetry, GitHub pull requests) by comparing original and edited documents.

Result: State-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score, struggling due to Transformer attention mechanisms' inability to handle gaps.

Conclusion: The study underscores the disparity between LLMs' superhuman performance on some tasks and unexpected breakdowns on others, like detecting omissions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

### [62] [A Gamified Evaluation and Recruitment Platform for Low Resource Language Machine Translation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11467)
*Carlos Rafael Catalan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages (LRLs) by proposing a gamified platform to recruit human evaluators and bridge the resource gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluators are crucial for nuanced MT evaluation, but LRLs lack datasets and evaluators. The paper aims to solve this resource gap.

Method: The paper reviews existing evaluation procedures and designs a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for MT developers.

Result: A design proposal for a platform to address the resource gap in datasets and evaluators for LRLs is presented.

Conclusion: The platform could aid MT system development and has broader applications in NLP research, though challenges in evaluation remain.

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a

well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-PRM introduces a process reward modeling framework to improve clinical decision-making by verifying reasoning steps against medical knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle to localize and correct errors in clinical reasoning, which is critical for accurate diagnosis and patient care.

Method: Uses retrieval-augmented generation to verify each reasoning step against medical knowledge bases, ensuring fine-grained reasoning quality.

Result: Improves base models by up to 13.50%, achieves over 80% accuracy on MedQA with small-scale models, and demonstrates plug-and-play generality.

Conclusion: Med-PRM effectively enhances clinical reasoning accuracy and can be integrated with existing models, offering significant improvements in medical QA tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Motivation: To explore the utility of LMs in biomedical NLP, specifically their ability to understand medical concepts like immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer.

Method: Evaluate medical conceptual grounding of various LMs by comparing their performance against expert clinicians in identifying immunotherapy hallmarks in breast cancer abstracts.

Result: Pre-trained LMs outperform large LMs in identifying very specific (low-level) medical concepts.

Conclusion: Pre-trained LMs show promise for specialized medical NLP tasks, particularly for low-level concept identification.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,

Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has
grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language

### [65] [Relational Schemata in BERT Are Inducible, Not Emergent: A Study of Performance vs. Competence in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11485)
*Cole Gawin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BERT's relational understanding is not innate from pretraining but can be induced via fine-tuning, showing behavioral performance doesn't guarantee structured conceptual competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if BERT's strong performance on semantic tasks reflects true conceptual competence or just surface-level statistical associations.

Method: Examined BERT's internal representations of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations, comparing pretrained and fine-tuned models.

Result: Pretrained BERT shows high classification accuracy but only organizes concept pairs by relation type after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Relational schemata in BERT are not emergent from pretraining alone but can be learned through task-specific fine-tuning, indicating behavioral performance doesn't equate to structured understanding.

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

### [66] [Lag-Relative Sparse Attention In Long Context Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11498)
*Manlai Liang,Wanyi Huang,Mandi Liu,Huaijun Li,Jinlong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA) with LagKV compression to improve LLM efficiency for long-context tasks without added parameters or high overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-context input due to high computational costs and memory, and existing compression methods degrade performance or are incompatible with post-training.

Method: LRSA uses chunk-by-chunk prefilling to select top K key-value pairs in a lagging window, focusing on relevant context while maintaining efficiency.

Result: LRSA enhances LLM robustness with key-value compression and improves fine-tuned performance in question-answer tasks.

Conclusion: LRSA effectively addresses long-context challenges in LLMs with minimal overhead, offering a practical solution for post-training optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

*Seongbo Jang,Seonghyeon Lee,Dongha Lee,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal dialogue systems, focusing on response retrieval in text and image modalities. It compares integration methods and highlights the efficiency of an end-to-end approach with parameter sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by enabling multimodal responses (text and image) and improving retrieval performance.

Method: Proposes three integration methods: a two-step approach and an end-to-end approach, with a focus on parameter sharing.

Result: The end-to-end approach matches performance without intermediate steps, and parameter sharing improves efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: End-to-end methods with parameter sharing are effective for multimodal dialogue response retrieval.

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUDI improves personalized dialogue generation by using discourse relations and persona descriptions, enhancing response coherence and naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized dialogue generation is challenging due to the need for coherence and consistency with user traits.

Method: MUDI uses a Large Language Model for discourse annotation, constructs dialogue graphs, and employs DialogueGAT for encoding. Coherence-aware attention strategies are used in decoding.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in response quality, making dialogues more human-like.

Conclusion: MUDI effectively enhances personalized dialogue generation by leveraging discourse relations and structured learning.

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform specialized models for Arabic and Yoruba diacritization, but smaller models hallucinate. Fine-tuning improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' effectiveness for text diacritization in Arabic and Yoruba, addressing ambiguities and comparing with specialized models.

Method: Introduced MultiDiac dataset, evaluated 14 LLMs and 6 specialized models, fine-tuned four small models with LoRA for Yoruba.

Result: LLMs outperformed specialized models, but smaller models had hallucinations. Fine-tuning improved performance and reduced hallucinations.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for diacritization, with fine-tuning enhancing smaller models' performance.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

*Simeon Junker,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneGram, a dataset for studying how scene context affects human conceptualization of objects, and compares it to multimodal LLMs, which lack human-like variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scene context influences human conceptualization of objects and to evaluate how well multimodal LLMs capture this variability.

Method: Created SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes in varied scenes, and analyzed references from multimodal LLMs.

Result: Multimodal LLMs do not replicate the richness and variability of human conceptualizations.

Conclusion: Scene context significantly shapes human conceptualization, and current LLMs fall short in capturing this complexity.

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in effectiveness and efficiency of scaling language models for domain-specific tasks, especially for small edge-side models.

Method: Utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models via reparameterization, reducing input context length for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning with competitive accuracy, 2.1x speedup, and 10.1x compression ratio on specific tasks.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen enables flexible specialization and efficient knowledge transfer between models, enhancing edge-side model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scarcity of annotated CRF datasets by converting existing datasets into structured CRFs, creating a high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling. Results show varying performance across languages and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Publicly available, well-annotated CRF datasets are scarce, hindering the development of CRF slot filling systems.

Method: A semi-automatic conversion methodology is applied to the E3C dataset in English and Italian to create structured CRFs.

Result: Slot filling achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English with zero-shot LLMs, with worse performance on open-source models.

Conclusion: Filling CRFs is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, and the new dataset is released to support further research.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

*Alicja Dobrzeniecka,Antske Fokkens,Pia Sommerauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amnesic probing examines linguistic info impact on models by removing specific info and observing performance changes. INLP, a common removal method, introduces random modifications. MP and LEACE are better alternatives for targeted info removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision of removing specific linguistic information in models to better understand their behavior.

Method: Uses Amnesic Probing with INLP, MP, and LEACE techniques to remove and assess linguistic info impact.

Result: MP and LEACE remove info more precisely than INLP, enhancing behavioral explanations.

Conclusion: MP and LEACE are superior to INLP for targeted info removal in Amnesic Probing, improving model behavior analysis.

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a framework for dynamic AI behavior adjustment based on human-interpretable directives, addressing limitations of static preference models like DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the rigidity of monolithic preference models in AI alignment by enabling adaptable, context-dependent behavior.

Method: CPT uses synthetically generated preference data conditioned on system prompts from fine-grained rubrics, allowing LLMs to adjust outputs without retraining.

Result: CPT provides fine-grained control and models nuanced human feedback, with experimental artifacts released.

Conclusion: CPT enhances AI adaptability and control, offering a scalable solution for dynamic preference alignment.

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting traditional high-performance matrix multiplication (gemm) to mixed-precision integer arithmetic for modern ISAs, showcasing performance gains over floating-point methods in DL inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift toward reduced-precision formats in deep learning (DL) for efficiency necessitates revisiting legacy gemm optimization methods to align with modern hardware capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces novel micro-kernel designs and data layouts tailored for mixed-precision integer arithmetic across x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V ISAs.

Result: Demonstrated significant performance improvements using mixed-precision integer arithmetic over floating-point implementations on three CPU architectures.

Conclusion: The work marks a new era in gemm optimization, driven by DL inference demands, termed the 'Cambrian period' for matrix multiplication.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART is a self-distillation framework that replaces autoregressive Chain-of-Thought reasoning with non-autoregressive Silent Thought, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive CoT reasoning in LLMs causes computational overhead, limiting use in latency-sensitive applications.

Method: DART uses two pathways: CoT for traditional reasoning and Silent Thought (ST) for direct answer generation, aligned via a Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM).

Result: DART matches baseline reasoning performance while significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: DART is a viable, efficient alternative for reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: DeepResearch Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating Deep Research Agents (DRAs), featuring 100 PhD-level tasks across 22 fields, with two novel evaluation methodologies for alignment with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating DRAs, which autonomously transform online information into analyst-grade reports, motivated the creation of DeepResearch Bench.

Method: Two methodologies are proposed: a reference-based method for assessing report quality and a framework for evaluating retrieval and citation accuracy.

Result: DeepResearch Bench, with its 100 tasks and evaluation frameworks, is open-sourced to accelerate DRA development.

Conclusion: The benchmark and methodologies aim to bridge the gap in evaluating DRAs, fostering advancements in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: The paper addresses length generalization in LLMs by focusing on output distribution alignment across varying sequence lengths, proposing a new metric and regularization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fixed context window in transformers limits LLMs' ability to handle long sequences, with length generalization being a key challenge.

Method: The study shifts focus from input features to output distribution, introducing the concept of long-short alignment and a metric (Long-Short Misalignment). A regularization term is developed to promote alignment during training.

Result: Experiments show a strong correlation between the proposed metric and length generalization performance, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The work provides new insights for improving long-context modeling in LLMs, with practical implications for training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the progressive left-leaning bias in LLMs and explore if persona prompts can align LLM behavior with socioeconomic groups for accurate political predictions.

Method: Uses zero-shot persona prompting with limited information to simulate voting behavior, testing stability against counterfactual arguments, different prompts, and generation methods.

Result: Achieves a weighted F1 score of ~0.793 in simulating European Parliament voting behavior, with a dataset and code made available.

Conclusion: Persona prompting can reasonably predict political behavior, offering a tool for simulating group policy positions and individual voting decisions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

*Simeon Junker,Manar Ali,Larissa Koch,Sina Zarrieß,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) linguistic abilities in reference resolution tasks using simple visual stimuli, revealing challenges in pragmatic capabilities like context-dependent color interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the pragmatic capabilities of MLLMs in handling abstract visual stimuli, despite the tasks being straightforward for humans.

Method: Investigating MLLMs' performance in reference resolution tasks involving color patches and grids.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic pragmatic capabilities, such as context-dependent color interpretation.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant challenges in MLLMs' pragmatic abilities, even with simple visual tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

### [82] [Post Persona Alignment for Multi-Session Dialogue Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11857)
*Yi-Pei Chen,Noriki Nishida,Hideki Nakayama,Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPA improves multi-session dialogue generation by aligning responses with persona after initial generation, enhancing consistency and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods constrain diversity by retrieving persona info before response generation, leading to generic outputs.

Method: PPA generates a general response first, retrieves persona memories post-hoc, and refines the response for alignment.

Result: PPA outperforms prior methods in consistency, diversity, and persona relevance.

Conclusion: PPA offers a flexible, effective paradigm for long-term personalized dialogue generation.

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

TL;DR: FourierAttention reduces KV cache memory demands in LLMs by projecting long-context-insensitive dimensions onto Fourier bases, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory inefficiency in LLMs due to growing KV cache, avoiding accuracy loss from existing compression methods.

Method: Projects transformer head dimensions onto Fourier bases, using spectral coefficients to approximate temporal evolution. Includes FlashFourierAttention for optimized memory.

Result: Achieves best long-context accuracy on LongBench and NIAH, with efficient deployment via custom Triton kernel.

Conclusion: FourierAttention offers a training-free, accurate, and memory-efficient solution for long-context tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance German language processing by leveraging updated architectures and tailored datasets.

Method: Incremental training on a German corpus using Whole Word Masking, extended with Nyströmformer and Longformer for long-context support.

Result: GeistBERT outperformed base models and set new SOTA in tasks like NER and text classification.

Conclusion: GeistBERT is a strong contribution to German NLP, with released models supporting further research.

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

TL;DR: A computational framework for assessing counter-speech effectiveness is proposed, defining six dimensions and achieving strong classification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of defining criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of counter-speech in mitigating online hate speech.

Method: Proposes a framework with six dimensions (Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience Adaptation, Fairness) and two classification strategies (multi-task and dependency-based).

Result: Achieves high F1 scores (0.94 and 0.96) on expert- and user-written counter-speech, outperforming baselines and showing dimension interdependence.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust tool for assessing counter-speech effectiveness, with potential community impact through the released linguistic resource.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

*Dongwei Jiang,Alvin Zhang,Andrew Wang,Nicholas Andrews,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to fully integrate near-perfect feedback, termed 'FEEDBACK FRICTION,' despite controlled experiments and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate how effectively LLMs incorporate extrinsic feedback under ideal conditions.

Method: Controlled experiments with solver models receiving targeted feedback from a generator with ground-truth answers, tested across diverse tasks and models.

Result: Models resist feedback (FEEDBACK FRICTION); sampling-based strategies improve but don't achieve target performance.

Conclusion: Highlighting FEEDBACK FRICTION and ruling out causes aids future self-improvement research in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A defense framework using contrastive representation learning (CRL) to improve LLM robustness against adversarial attacks, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses lack generalization across attack types.

Method: Finetunes models with triplet-based loss and adversarial hard negative mining to separate benign and harmful representations.

Result: Outperforms prior defenses, improving robustness against input-level and embedding-space attacks without standard performance loss.

Conclusion: The proposed CRL-based framework effectively enhances LLM defense against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of LLMs on programming practices, particularly code style, given their rapid advancement.

Method: Analyzed code from 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers (2020-2025), measuring trends like naming conventions and complexity.

Result: Found measurable trends, e.g., snake_case usage in Python rose from 47% to 51% (2023-2025), indicating LLM influence on coding style.

Conclusion: LLMs significantly affect real-world programming style, as evidenced by large-scale empirical data.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate object detection in low-resolution or inconsistent-quality images.

Method: Uses ESRGAN to enhance low-resolution images as a pre-processing step, followed by Faster R-CNN for detection.

Result: The integrated approach outperforms traditional methods on low-resolution inputs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust solution for object detection in scenarios with variable or limited image quality.

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves

TL;DR: The paper introduces enhancements to the RefAV framework for scenario mining in autonomous driving, addressing LLM-generated code errors and spatial-relationship misinterpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the reliability and precision of scenario mining from autonomous driving datasets like Argoverse 2 by refining LLM-generated code and spatial-relationship functions.

Method: Two key enhancements: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation mechanism, and (2) specialized prompt engineering for better spatial-relationship comprehension.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains, achieving a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the Argoverse 2 test set with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively improve scenario mining reliability and precision.

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to identify and analyze objects in dense, unstable environments for quality control in pellet production.

Method: Utilizes StarDist for segmenting, contouring, classifying, and measuring pellet dimensions, focusing on size distribution and quality types.

Result: A novel method for detecting objects with smoothed boundaries, enhancing measurement accuracy and size distribution analysis.

Conclusion: StarDist provides a robust solution for pellet classification and measurement challenges.

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification

TL;DR: STT introduces an efficient image segmentation model using foveated input images and variable-resolution patch tokenization to reduce computational cost while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in image segmentation without reducing model size by focusing on the region of interest.

Method: Extracts a crop centered on a point prompt and applies variable-resolution patch tokenization, downsampling patches farther from the prompt.

Result: STT is more efficient than prior work, runs at interactive frame rates, and remains competitive on benchmarks.

Conclusion: STT is a promising tool for augmented reality or robotics due to its efficiency and focus on regions of interest.

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address under-researched fairness in automated pain detection across demographic groups, focusing on gender.

Method: Evaluated traditional ML (L SVM, RBF SVM) and DL (CNN, ViT) models on the UNBC-McMaster database using performance and fairness metrics.

Result: ViT achieved highest accuracy but all models showed gender biases, revealing an accuracy-fairness trade-off.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware techniques are needed to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of estimating 3D hand articulation from a single color image, addressing depth absence, occlusions, and camera parameter dependency.

Method: An optimization pipeline with keypoint alignment and fingertip loss to bypass camera parameter requirements.

Result: Competitive performance with SotA on benchmarks, robust in-the-wild processing, and sensitivity to 2D keypoint accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively estimates 3D hand articulation without camera parameters, showing robustness and competitive performance.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextLoss (CLoss), a novel loss function for image segmentation that improves topological correctness by considering errors in their full context within critical pixel masks. It also proposes two metrics for connectivity verification and benchmarks CLoss on multiple datasets, showing significant improvements in topology-aware metrics and missed connection repairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological errors in segmented structures (e.g., vessels, roads) can have significant impacts (e.g., on navigation). Existing solutions lack context-awareness in addressing these errors.

Method: Proposes ContextLoss (CLoss), which incorporates the full context of topological errors in critical pixel masks to enhance focus on such errors. Introduces two metrics for connectivity validation.

Result: CLoss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, repairing up to 44% more missed connections and improving topology-aware metrics across 2D, 3D, and nano-imaging datasets.

Conclusion: CLoss effectively enhances topological correctness in segmentation tasks, validated by improved metrics and connectivity repairs. The code is made publicly available.

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

TL;DR: JAFAR is a lightweight, attention-based feature upsampler that enhances spatial resolution for Foundation Vision Encoders, outperforming existing methods without high-resolution supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation Vision Encoders lack high-resolution outputs, requiring upsampling for downstream tasks. JAFAR addresses this gap.

Method: JAFAR uses an attention-based module with Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation to align high-resolution queries and low-resolution keys.

Result: JAFAR recovers fine-grained details and outperforms existing upsampling methods across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: JAFAR is effective and generalizes well to higher output scales, offering a flexible solution for feature upsampling.

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

TL;DR: Agentic AI using LLMs autonomously builds a computer vision system for medical image analysis, achieving high accuracy in segmenting lungs, heart, and ribs from chest x-rays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI in automating complex tasks like computer vision system configuration, traditionally requiring human expertise.

Method: Extended SimpleMind with an LLM-based agent to interpret prompts, plan workflows, and configure tools for medical image segmentation.

Result: The system autonomously achieved mean dice scores of 0.96 (lungs), 0.82 (heart), and 0.83 (ribs) on 50 chest x-rays.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can automate planning and tool configuration in computer vision, reducing reliance on data scientists.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation improves performance by leveraging uncertainty, dynamic weighting, class rebalancing, and contrastive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges like ineffective pseudo-label use, class imbalance biases, and ignored prediction uncertainty in SSSS.

Method: Introduces fuzzy pseudo-labeling, uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, adaptive class rebalancing, and lightweight contrastive regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively transforms uncertainty into a learning asset, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

TL;DR: AlignHuman improves human video generation by optimizing motion naturalness and visual fidelity using timestep-segment preference optimization and specialized LoRAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between motion naturalness and visual fidelity in human animation tasks.

Method: Proposes AlignHuman with timestep-segment preference optimization (TPO) and two specialized LoRAs for motion and fidelity optimization.

Result: Achieves a 3.3× speedup (100 to 30 NFEs) with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: AlignHuman effectively balances motion and fidelity, enhancing efficiency and quality in human animation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Conclusion: 3D-RAD and its training set 3D-RAD-T aim to advance multimodal medical AI research and improve 3D medical visual understanding.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset

medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-to-3D models lack physical knowledge, leading to impractical designs. This work aims to bridge the gap for engineering applications.

Method: Introduces an online black-box refinement loop combining visual and physics-based evaluations to iteratively refine prompts.

Result: Improves physical conformity by 4.5% to 106.7% over conventional models, demonstrated in vehicle design.

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D shows promise for broader Physical AI applications in science and engineering.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

TL;DR: CURSOR is a novel framework for recovering mental targets from EEG and image data without labeled information, demonstrating success in predicting image similarity, ranking stimuli, and generating indistinguishable stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of recovering mental targets from EEG and image data lacks solutions for unlabeled scenarios, motivating the development of a self-calibrating method.

Method: CURSOR is introduced as an algorithm that learns to recover unknown mental targets without labeled data or pre-trained decoders, tested on naturalistic face images.

Result: CURSOR predicts image similarity scores correlating with human judgments, ranks stimuli against unknown targets, and generates indistinguishable stimuli (validated via user study, N=53).

Conclusion: CURSOR successfully addresses the challenge of recovering mental targets without labeled data, offering a promising framework for uncalibrated EEG-image applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

TL;DR: AutoCaption uses MCTS to create diverse video captions for evaluating MLLMs, resulting in the MCTS-VCB benchmark. It improves model performance and provides comprehensive evaluation.


<details>

Motivation: Existing video captioning benchmarks have issues like limited diversity, high costs, and narrow evaluation scopes.

Method: Leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively generate diverse and detailed video captions, forming the MCTS-VCB benchmark.

Result: MCTS-VCB effectively evaluates MLLMs, with Gemini-1.5-Pro scoring highest (71.2 F1). Fine-tuning with AutoCaption data boosts performance (25% on MCTS-VCB, 16.3% on DREAM-1K).

Conclusion: AutoCaption enhances video captioning evaluation and model performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and utility.

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human social behavior, especially non-verbal cues, is challenging, and VLMs' potential in this area is understudied.

Method: The authors propose a new task (Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference), create a dataset, and benchmark several VLMs.

Result: The study identifies a gap in VLMs' ability to infer social cues and evaluates their performance on the new task.

Conclusion: VLMs have limitations in social reasoning, and the proposed task and dataset provide a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

TL;DR: A deep learning method uses synthetic data to visualize Earth's subsurface, improving with borehole data and enabling applications like resource exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of visualizing Earth's subsurface for applications like resource exploration and hazard assessment drives the need for innovative deep learning solutions.

Method: A neural network is trained on synthetic data mimicking geological processes to generate 3D subsurface images from surface data and boreholes.

Result: The model produces high-fidelity 3D images of subsurface structures, improving with more borehole data.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for subsurface visualization and can be fine-tuned for specific regional applications, serving as a regularizer in inverse problems.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Method: Tested BiLSTM and CNN+GRU on UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR datasets, analyzing spatial and temporal feature extraction capabilities.

Result: CNN+GRU achieved 95.20% accuracy on UT-HAR (spatial features), while BiLSTM scored 92.05% on NTU-Fi HAR (temporal dependencies).

Conclusion: Dataset characteristics and preprocessing significantly influence model performance. Both models show promise for real-world applications like healthcare and smart homes.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored application of LLMs in visual question answering for medical imaging and the impracticality of supervised fine-tuning due to data and cost constraints.

Method: A vision-language model processes medical images and textual prompts to generate visual feature interpretations, which an LLM consolidates into a diagnosis using test-time scaling.

Result: The framework improves diagnostic accuracy across radiology, ophthalmology, and histopathology, with unbiased prompting enhancing reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot framework effectively enhances LLM reasoning for medical diagnosis, offering a practical solution to data limitations.

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

### [113] [WaveFormer: A Lightweight Transformer Model for sEMG-based Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11168)
*Yanlong Chen,Mattia Orlandi,Pierangelo Maria Rapa,Simone Benatti,Luca Benini,Yawei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveFormer is a lightweight transformer-based model for sEMG gesture recognition, achieving high accuracy (95%) with low computational cost (3.1M parameters) and real-time performance (6.75 ms latency).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying similar gestures with nearly identical sEMG signals is challenging, and traditional deep learning models are too large for embedded systems.

Method: WaveFormer integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features using a learnable wavelet transform and a WaveletConv module for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves 95% accuracy on the EPN612 dataset and real-time inference with 6.75 ms latency on an Intel CPU.

Conclusion: WaveFormer is a compact, efficient solution for sEMG gesture recognition, suitable for resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

*Hongyu Chen,Jiping Liu,Yong Wang,Jun Zhu,Dejun Feng,Yakun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SF-TMAT is a novel framework for UAV object detection in adverse conditions, addressing domain gaps and noisy pseudo-labels with dynamic mask adjustment and variance feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods fail in UAV adverse scenes due to unique perspectives and noisy labels, necessitating a specialized benchmark and adaptive techniques.

Method: SF-TMAT uses DSFMA for dynamic mask adjustment and VFST for variance-based thresholding to improve pseudo-label quality and feature alignment.

Result: SF-TMAT outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior generalization in adverse UAV scenes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates domain bias and enhances UAV object detection in challenging conditions, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

*Nguyen Linh Dan Le,Jing Ren,Ciyuan Peng,Chengyao Xie,Bowen Li,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMAP is a multimodal graph learning framework for efficiently identifying neurodegenerative disease-affected brain regions, reducing computational overhead by 50% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods lack precision in localizing disease-relevant brain regions and face high computational complexity, limiting practical use.

Method: BrainMAP uses atlas-driven filtering to extract critical subgraphs and employs multimodal fusion with cross-node attention and adaptive gating for fMRI and DTI data.

Result: BrainMAP reduces computational overhead by over 50% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: BrainMAP offers a precise and computationally efficient solution for neurodegenerative disease detection, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

*Amirali Ataee Naeini,Ashkan Teymouri,Ghazaleh Jafarsalehi,Michael Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model improves vehicle speed detection accuracy, lane identification, and vehicle classification (cars vs. heavy vehicles) using drone footage from Northern California.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in vehicle numbers in California, due to poor transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, demands better speed detection methods for traffic monitoring and regulation.

Method: The study uses a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model trained on 800 bird's-eye view images to detect vehicle speeds, identify lanes, and classify vehicles. It also evaluates factors like drone height, ROI distance, and vehicle speed.

Result: The model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 mph², outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification, meeting traffic monitoring needs.

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

*Yuwen Tan,Boqing Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from data-tracing machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models, aligning with practical needs and cognitive insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-tracing unlearning is insufficient for diverse requests on foundation models, and knowledge-tracing aligns better with human cognitive processes.

Method: The paper suggests knowledge-tracing unlearning, supported by practical needs and cognitive studies, and provides a case study on a vision-language foundation model.

Result: Knowledge-tracing unlearning is more feasible and aligned with human forgetting than data-tracing for foundation models.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for knowledge-tracing machine unlearning as a more practical and cognitively aligned approach for foundation models.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STRIDE, a spatio-temporal dataset for world modeling, and TARDIS, a transformer-based model, to address dynamic real-world challenges. It shows strong performance in agent tasks like image synthesis and georeferencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments change dynamically in space and time, posing challenges for world models. The goal is to capture these dynamics for better agent behavior.

Method: Developed STRIDE, a dataset with interconnected observation, state, and action nodes. Used TARDIS, a transformer-based model, to integrate spatial and temporal dynamics.

Result: Demonstrated robust performance in tasks like image synthesis, instruction following, and georeferencing.

Conclusion: STRIDE and TARDIS offer a promising direction for creating generalist agents with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints
are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.

*Aaron Banze,Timothée Stassin,Nassim Ait Ali Braham,Rıdvan Salih Kuzu,Simon Besnard,Michael Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is introduced to benchmark geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs), addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets for Geo-FMs are limited to specific tasks and regions, lacking diversity for comprehensive evaluation.

Method: The dataset combines hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from EnMAP and AGB estimates from lidars, covering seven regions. Geo-FMs and a U-Net baseline are evaluated.

Result: Geo-FMs match or surpass U-Net performance, especially with fine-tuning. Performance varies by dataset size and token patch size in Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The dataset supports Geo-FM development, evaluation, and research on geographic bias and generalization. It will be publicly released.

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GynSurg, a large and diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopy, addressing limitations of existing datasets to enhance surgical scene understanding and action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for gynecologic laparoscopy are limited in scale, task focus, or annotation detail, hindering comprehensive workflow analysis.

Method: The authors introduce GynSurg, a dataset with rich annotations for multiple tasks, and benchmark state-of-the-art models under a standardized protocol.

Result: GynSurg is demonstrated to be high-quality and versatile, supporting applications like action recognition and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The dataset is publicly released to accelerate progress in surgical video analysis and computer-assisted intervention.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

*Yihan Wu,Xuehao Cui,Ruibo Chen,Georgios Milis,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-reweight, a distortion-free watermarking method for image generation models to address retokenization mismatch and enhance authenticity verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of image generation models (e.g., deepfakes, phishing) necessitates robust verification methods, but traditional watermarking techniques fail due to retokenization mismatch.

Method: C-reweight uses a clustering-based strategy to treat tokens equivalently within clusters, mitigating retokenization mismatch while preserving image quality.

Result: C-reweight outperforms existing distortion-free watermarking techniques, maintaining visual quality and improving detectability.

Conclusion: C-reweight sets a new standard for secure and trustworthy image synthesis by effectively addressing retokenization mismatch.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Nikos Deligiannis,Aleksandra Pižurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method for hyperspectral images (HSIs) is proposed, jointly capturing local and non-local structures with linear complexity (O(n)).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subspace clustering methods for HSIs are computationally intensive (O(n^2)), lack joint local and non-local structure constraints, and fail to supervise the entire clustering process effectively.

Method: A one-stage approach with spatial smoothness (local) and mini-cluster-based (non-local) constraints, jointly optimized for efficient HSI clustering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with O(n) complexity, suitable for large-scale HSIs.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently integrates local and non-local structures, offering scalable and superior performance for HSI clustering.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for generating text-image plans, addressing alignment and coherence challenges, and validates it with a new benchmark and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focuses on textual plan generation, leaving text-image plans understudied. The paper aims to bridge this gap by addressing alignment and coherence issues.

Method: Proposes a step-by-step framework that drafts textual steps, edits visual steps, extracts PDDL-like visual info, and refines drafts iteratively.

Result: The approach improves backbone models like Mistral-7B and GPT-4o, validated on a new benchmark of 1,100 tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates high-quality text-image plans, demonstrated by experiments and new metrics.

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

TL;DR: A new dynamic bidirectional spatial tower replaces attention mechanisms in VQA, enhancing reasoning and spatial relationship understanding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods struggle with complex reasoning due to weak cross-modal interaction and poor spatial relationship capture.

Method: Proposed a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower with four layers, mimicking human gestalt vision for better spatial organization.

Result: The module improves spatial reasoning, works with any multimodal model, and achieves SOTA results with 3B parameters.

Conclusion: The approach advances VQA by shifting from pixel-based to perceptual-unit-based reasoning, excelling in spatial tasks.

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a preference learning method, \mymethod, to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by focusing on specific target areas where errors occur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs undermine reliability, especially in tasks requiring accurate object identification.

Method: A dataset with hallucinated and correct responses is built, and preference learning is applied to target areas to filter irrelevant signals.

Result: The method effectively reduces hallucinations in vision-language tasks without degrading overall performance.

Conclusion: \mymethod improves MLLM reliability by focusing on correcting hallucinations in targeted areas.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Auto-Connect introduces a connectivity-preserving tokenization scheme for automatic rigging, improving skeletal topology and skinning quality through reward-guided fine-tuning and geodesic-aware bone selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods fail to explicitly preserve skeletal connectivity, leading to topological inaccuracies and poor skinning quality. Auto-Connect aims to address these limitations.

Method: The method uses connectivity-preserving tokens, a topology-aware reward function, and geodesic features for bone selection. It employs reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization for fine-tuning.

Result: The approach generates anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties, mitigating skinning artifacts.

Conclusion: Auto-Connect significantly enhances topological accuracy and skinning quality, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a black-box auditing framework (FSCA) for text-to-image diffusion models to address copyright and privacy issues without needing internal model knowledge. It outperforms baselines and achieves high accuracy in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auditing methods for text-to-image diffusion models rely on unrealistic assumptions or unreliable evaluations, creating a need for a more practical solution.

Method: The FSCA framework uses semantic connections within the model for auditing, avoiding internal knowledge access. It includes recall balance and threshold adjustment strategies.

Result: FSCA outperforms eight baselines on LAION-mi and COCO datasets, achieving 90% user-level accuracy with minimal samples.

Conclusion: FSCA is a superior, practical solution for auditing text-to-image diffusion models, with strong real-world applicability.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAViS is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) that combines multimodal foundation models (ImageBind) and a segmentation model (SAM2) using a text-bridged design to address cross-modal alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of aligning audio and visual modalities in AVS, with existing methods failing to effectively combine foundation models for cross-modal alignment.

Method: Introduces TAViS, which uses a text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism and alignment supervision strategy to align shared semantic concepts between audio and visual modalities.

Result: Superior performance on single-source, multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: TAViS effectively addresses cross-modal alignment challenges in AVS by leveraging text as a bridge between modalities and combining foundation models.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised contrastive learning model with uncertainty awareness improves cancer subtyping by selectively labeling key images, achieving top performance with minimal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cancer subtyping models by incorporating uncertainty awareness, reducing reliance on extensive labeled datasets while improving precision.

Method: Introduces uncertainty awareness via evidence vectors to assess model confidence, using uncertainty scores to guide selective annotation and iterative training refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1-10% of strategically selected annotations on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method efficiently minimizes annotation needs and boosts classification precision, offering a promising approach for digital pathology with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs) for AV perception, showing superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to traditional DNNs, with minimal accuracy drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNNs in AVs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses degrade benign accuracy or fail to generalize.

Method: Fine-tuned vision-language models (V2LMs) are proposed, evaluated in Solo Mode (task-specific) and Tandem Mode (multi-task).

Result: V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with <8% drops vs. DNNs' 33-46% drops. Tandem Mode is memory-efficient and robust.

Conclusion: V2LMs enhance AV perception security and resilience against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

*Wasim Ahmad,Yan-Tsung Peng,Yuan-Hao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAME is a lightweight framework for attributing Deepfake videos to their generative models, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Deepfake videos threatens digital security and media integrity, but model attribution (identifying the source model) is underexplored.

Method: FAME uses spatio-temporal attention mechanisms to capture generative artifacts specific to face-swap models.

Result: FAME outperforms existing methods on datasets like DFDM, FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb in accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: FAME is effective for real-world forensic applications due to its accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

### [132] [Environmental Change Detection: Toward a Practical Task of Scene Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11481)
*Kyusik Cho,Suhan Woo,Hongje Seong,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Environmental Change Detection (ECD), a practical task for detecting scene changes without relying on perfectly aligned reference images, using a novel framework that leverages multiple references and semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Scene Change Detection (SCD) assumes idealized, perfectly aligned reference images, which is unrealistic. The paper aims to address this by proposing ECD, which relies on environmental cues from uncurated images.

Method: The proposed framework jointly understands spatial environments and detects changes by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating semantically rich representations to overcome viewpoint misalignment and limited FOV.

Result: The framework outperforms naive combinations of state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable performance to the oracle setting on three benchmark sets.

Conclusion: ECD is a more practical approach to change detection, and the proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional SCD by utilizing environmental cues and multiple references.

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated images on social media threatens information integrity, and current SID methods fail on altered images.

Method: The research combines data augmentation, a genetic algorithm for optimal selection, and dual-criteria optimization.

Result: The approach improves detection under real-world perturbations, with a 22.53% increase in mean average precision.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for robust synthetic image detection, with code available on GitHub.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

*Tung-Long Vuong,Hoang Phan,Vy Vo,Anh Bui,Thanh-Toan Do,Trung Le,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve pseudo-labels in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) by leveraging the geometry of visual and text embeddings in multi-modal models like CLIP, addressing deviations in embedding distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods relying on CLIP suffer from deviations in visual embedding distributions, leading to misguided signals. The paper aims to enhance pseudo-labels and target-prompt learning by exploiting embedding geometry.

Method: The approach uses reference predictions from source prompts and enforces clustering behavior between visual and text embeddings via optimal transport theory.

Result: Experiments show superior performance and improved target-prompt quality, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy successfully addresses embedding deviations, enhancing UDA performance through better pseudo-labeling and alignment.

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manager, a plugin for VLMs that enhances performance by adaptively aggregating insights from unimodal experts, improving VL alignment and fusion. It outperforms baselines on downstream tasks and boosts zero-shot performance in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of BridgeTower, such as ineffective unimodal representation use and restricted semantic exploitation, and extend evaluation to high-resolution datasets.

Method: Propose ManagerTower under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, integrating a manager in each cross-modal layer. Extend to MLLMs with LLaVA-OV-Manager.

Result: Superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks and significant zero-shot performance boost on 20 MLLM datasets.

Conclusion: Manager and multi-grid algorithm synergize to improve visual representation, mitigating semantic ambiguity and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

TL;DR: A GNSS-inertial initialization strategy delays global GNSS measurements until sufficient data is available, using relative distance residuals initially and a Hessian-based criterion for switching, outperforming naive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor initial estimates from limited measurements can lead to local minima in non-linear optimization, necessitating a better initialization approach.

Method: Uses GNSS relative distance residuals initially, switching to global measurements based on Hessian matrix singular values.

Result: Outperforms naive global GNSS usage, providing more accurate and robust initializations on EuRoC and GVINS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy improves initialization accuracy by delaying global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available.

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIMA-Q is a novel post-training quantization method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses accuracy degradation in low-bit quantization by leveraging KL divergence and FIM, with efficient approximations like DPLR-FIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PTQ methods for ViTs suffer from significant accuracy loss, especially in low-bit quantization, due to limitations in Hessian-guided quantization loss.

Method: Proposes FIMA-Q, which connects KL divergence and FIM for fast quantization loss computation, and introduces DPLR-FIM for efficient FIM approximation.

Result: Extensive experiments show FIMA-Q outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-bit quantization, across various ViT architectures and tasks.

Conclusion: FIMA-Q effectively improves PTQ accuracy for ViTs, offering a practical solution for low-bit quantization with publicly available code.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Conclusion: SITS-Extreme offers scalable, accurate detection for large-scale disaster monitoring.

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust rotation estimation is critical for safety-critical applications, but traditional methods are non-linear and non-convex, requiring careful design.

Method: Reformulates rotation estimation as a linear problem, uses quaternion sphere geometry for a voting-based method, and leverages GPU parallelism.

Result: Achieves exceptional robustness to noise and outliers, solving large-scale (10^6) and highly corrupted (99% outliers) problems in under 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, robust, and efficient, validated by controlled and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the under-explored application of free-energy-guided self-repair in VQA due to temporal dynamics and model constraints.

Method: Dual-branch architecture with aesthetic and technical branches, specialized enhancement modules, and a biologically inspired prediction head.

Result: Competitive or superior performance on five public VQA benchmarks with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA effectively integrates free-energy-based self-repair in VQA, overcoming challenges and enhancing performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

TL;DR: DaMO is a data-efficient Video LLM designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding, outperforming prior methods in tasks requiring precise temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal reasoning, limiting their ability to attribute responses to specific video moments under constrained supervision.

Method: DaMO uses a Temporal-aware Fuseformer with a hierarchical dual-stream architecture for temporal dynamics and multimodal fusion, plus a global residual for efficiency. Training involves a four-stage progressive paradigm.

Result: DaMO surpasses prior methods in temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks, excelling in precise temporal alignment tasks.

Conclusion: DaMO sets a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling, addressing limitations in temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

Result: The benchmark and pipeline reveal the relationship between MLLMs' reasoning and visual perception, with accuracy differences highlighting visual faithfulness.

Conclusion: VFaith-Bench provides a tool to analyze and improve MLLMs' visual reasoning, exposing gaps in current models' capabilities.

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

*Bachir Tchana Tankeu,Mohamed Bouteldja,Nicolas Grignard,Bernard Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CNN-based method (YOLOv8s) is proposed for detecting lifted truck axles in images, achieving high precision (87%) and recall (91.7%) with fast inference time (1.4 ms).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current technologies like WIM systems struggle to classify vehicles with lifted axles, and few methods exist for detecting them.

Method: Uses YOLOv8s, a convolutional neural network, to detect lifted axles in truck images captured by perpendicular cameras.

Result: Achieved 87% precision, 91.7% recall, and 1.4 ms inference time, suitable for real-time use.

Conclusion: The method is effective but could be improved with larger datasets or image augmentation.

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OV-MAP enhances 3D mapping for robots by integrating open-features and a class-agnostic segmentation model, achieving zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overlapping features in 3D maps reduce precision; OV-MAP aims to improve instance-level accuracy by addressing feature spill-over.

Method: Uses a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D, merges raw and synthetic depth, and employs a 3D mask voting mechanism.

Result: Demonstrates superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and adaptability on datasets like ScanNet200 and Replica, plus real-world tests.

Conclusion: OV-MAP effectively addresses feature blending in 3D maps, enabling accurate zero-shot segmentation without 3D supervision.

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EasyARC, a vision-language benchmark for multimodal reasoning, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning and self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack true visual reasoning with complex vision-language interactions, prompting the need for a more robust evaluation tool.

Method: EasyARC is procedurally generated, scalable, and includes progressive difficulty levels, making it suitable for RL pipelines. State-of-the-art models are benchmarked and analyzed.

Result: EasyARC sets a new standard for evaluating reasoning and scaling in vision-language models, with open-sourced dataset and code.

Conclusion: EasyARC advances multimodal reasoning evaluation and is a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

### [146] [A$^2$LC: Active and Automated Label Correction for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11599)
*Youjin Jeon,Kyusik Cho,Suhan Woo,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A$^2$LC is a novel Active and Automated Label Correction framework for semantic segmentation, improving efficiency and performance by integrating automated correction and adaptive balancing of underrepresented classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic segmentation is costly and error-prone. ALC aims to address this but remains inefficient.

Method: A$^2$LC integrates automated correction using annotator feedback and introduces an adaptively balanced acquisition function for tail classes.

Result: A$^2$LC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high efficiency (20% budget) and a 27.23% performance improvement on Cityscapes.

Conclusion: A$^2$LC is a highly efficient and effective solution for label correction in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Ruobei Zhang,Shengeng Tang,Huan Yan,Xiang Zhang,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal method for WiFi-based human behavior recognition improves accuracy by fusing phase and Doppler Shift data using dual-branch self-attention and group attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single data types, ignoring feature interaction and fusion, limiting recognition accuracy.

Method: Proposes a multimodal approach combining phase and Doppler Shift data with dual-branch self-attention and group attention mechanisms, optimized via a gating mechanism.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in in-domain and cross-domain experiments on Widar3.0 and XRF55 datasets.

Conclusion: The method enhances recognition accuracy by effectively fusing and optimizing multimodal features.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignAligner, a novel method for realistic sign language generation, uses text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and video synthesis to improve accuracy and expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving realistic and naturalistic sign language generation is challenging due to the complexity of hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements.

Method: SignAligner involves three stages: text-driven pose co-generation, online collaborative correction, and realistic video synthesis, using Transformer-based text encoding and cross-modal attention.

Result: SignAligner significantly improves the accuracy and expressiveness of generated sign videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of sign language generation, producing high-fidelity and diverse sign representations.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

### [149] [Evaluating Fairness and Mitigating Bias in Machine Learning: A Novel Technique using Tensor Data and Bayesian Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11627)
*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fairness evaluation technique for ML in image classification, focusing on skin color as tensor data, using probability distributions and statistical distance measures to avoid rigid categorization. It also proposes a training method to mitigate biases in skin tone categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in ML is crucial, especially for sensitive attributes like skin color, which differs from categorical features. Prior work lacks methods to handle tensor data like skin color without rigid classification, leading to potential biases.

Method: The paper converts skin color tensor data into probability distributions and applies statistical distance measures. It also introduces a training method using Bayesian regression with polynomial functions for color distance estimates.

Result: The approach captures fine-grained fairness nuances within and across groups, addressing limitations of traditional categorical fairness evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin color in ML models, advancing fairness in Trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

*Emre Kavak,Tom Nuno Wolf,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM and DISCO to address models using irrelevant signals (like lighting conditions) in predictions, ensuring focus on causal paths and achieving competitive bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models often exploit irrelevant signals (e.g., lighting) due to selection bias, leading to undesirable predictions. The goal is to ensure predictors rely on causally relevant features.

Method: Proposes SAM, a causal framework for anti-causal prediction, and DISCO, a regularization strategy using conditional distance correlation to enforce conditional independence.

Result: DISCO achieves competitive results in bias mitigation, proving effective as an alternative to kernel-based methods.

Conclusion: SAM and DISCO provide a robust solution to mitigate bias by focusing on causal pathways, improving prediction reliability.

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

*Yunhan Ren,Ruihuang Li,Lingbo Liu,Changwen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline for identifying prohibited items in X-ray images, leveraging SAM for representation and a bilayer mask decoder for occlusion handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task is challenging due to appearance gaps and severe overlapping in X-ray images.

Method: Integrates SAM for representation and designs an occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder. Uses manually annotated occlusion datasets (PIDray-A, PIXray-A).

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on occlusion-annotated datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses occlusion and representation gaps in X-ray image segmentation.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

TL;DR: Proposes D-MoLE, a method for continual multimodal instruction tuning in MLLMs, addressing architecture conflicts and modality imbalance, achieving 15% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks is challenging due to fixed architectures and modality imbalances.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts (D-MoLE), featuring a dynamic layer-wise expert allocator and a gradient-based inter-modal continual curriculum.

Result: D-MoLE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 15% on average.

Conclusion: First study to address continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective, demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM-CGNS, a method for improving medical visual representation learning by addressing negative sampling, fine-grained details, and low-level feature retention through cross-modal clustering and masked image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for medical visual representation learning suffer from poor negative sampling, lack of fine-grained details, and neglect of low-level features, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed CM-CGNS method uses cross-modal clustering for better negative sampling and a masked image reconstruction module to enhance cross-modal interaction and retain low-level features.

Result: Experiments on five datasets show CM-CGNS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CM-CGNS effectively addresses key limitations in medical visual representation learning, demonstrating superior performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the predictive value of airway-related imaging biomarkers for survival outcomes in lung fibrosis patients.

Method: A three-stage approach: 1) nn-Unet for airway segmentation, 2) radiomic feature extraction from trachea and airway regions, 3) SVM classification using extracted features.

Result: Achieved segmentation score of 0.8601 (Task 1) and classification score of 0.7346 (Task 2).

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for using airway imaging biomarkers to predict survival in lung fibrosis patients.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Motivation: The study aims to benchmark different models for human action recognition and understand their performance and failure modes.

Method: Models from simple fully connected networks to transformer architectures were tested on a three-class subset of the COCO image corpus. Explainability techniques like SHAP and LeGrad heatmaps were used.

Result: The binary ViT achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly outperforming convolutional networks (~35%) and CLIP-based models (~62-64%). Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these differences.

Conclusion: Transformers like ViT are data-efficient and excel in action recognition, with explainability tools crucial for diagnosing model failures.

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

TL;DR: MTabVQA is a new benchmark for multi-tabular visual question answering, addressing gaps in current VLMs' ability to reason across multiple table images. Fine-tuning with MTabVQA-Instruct improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of VLMs' ability to parse and reason across diverse table images, a common real-world scenario.

Method: Introduces MTabVQA, a benchmark with 3,745 complex question-answer pairs requiring multi-hop reasoning across table images, and MTabVQA-Instruct for fine-tuning.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs show limitations on MTabVQA, but fine-tuning with MTabVQA-Instruct significantly improves performance.

Conclusion: MTabVQA fills a critical gap in evaluating VLMs for multi-tabular reasoning, and fine-tuning enhances their capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Method: DMAF-Net uses a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion module, a synergistic distillation framework, and a Dynamic Training Monitoring strategy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020 datasets.

Conclusion: DMAF-Net effectively handles incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation with dynamic balancing and structural alignment.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and
MyoPS2020 demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Our code is available at

Result: The standard model performs best overall, especially in vision-heavy tasks, while the DCI version excels in tasks requiring semantic coherence or structured change understanding.

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with plug-and-play techniques like DCI shows promise for Interleave tasks, with each variant suited to different task demands.

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based
Understanding and Interactive Multi-Modal Communication. Secondly, we add the
Dense Channel Integration (DCI) connector to the LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave and
compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard
model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or
structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and

TL;DR: DiffFuSR is a modular pipeline for super-resolving Sentinel-2 imagery to 2.5m GSD, using diffusion-based SR and fusion networks, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Sentinel-2 imagery resolution uniformly across all spectral bands, addressing limitations in current super-resolution and pansharpening methods.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) diffusion-based SR trained on harmonized RGB data, (2) fusion network for upscaling multispectral bands using SR RGB as a prior. Includes degradation model and encoder for blind SR.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines in fidelity, spectral consistency, and alignment. Fusion network surpasses classical pansharpening for 20m/60m bands.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion for Sentinel-2 SR, offering a modular framework.

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

TL;DR: MambaVSR introduces a state-space model framework for video super-resolution (VSR), addressing challenges in non-local dependency modeling and computational efficiency with innovative modules like SCC and CAS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods struggle with large motion displacements and long sequences due to reliance on optical flow or transformers. MambaVSR aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposes MambaVSR with Shared Compass Construction (SCC) for intra-frame connectivity and Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS) for non-local alignment. Uses Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) for detail recovery.

Result: Outperforms Transformer-based methods by 0.58 dB PSNR on REDS dataset with 55% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MambaVSR effectively addresses VSR challenges, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION combines discriminative (CLIP) and generative (diffusion) models for anomaly detection, outperforming baselines on benchmarks like MVTec-AD and VisA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is challenging due to ambiguous definitions, diverse anomaly types, and limited data. A comprehensive model is needed to capture both low-level and high-level features.

Method: CLIPFUSION leverages CLIP for global features and diffusion models for local details, using cross-attention and feature maps for anomaly detection.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in anomaly segmentation and classification on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Conclusion: CLIPFUSION demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion for scalable anomaly detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

*Zikang Leng,Megha Thukral,Yaqi Liu,Hrudhai Rajasekhar,Shruthi K. Hiremath,Thomas Plötz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline using LLMs and VirtualHome, creates diverse HAR datasets, improving model performance with limited real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large-scale, diverse labeled datasets and variability in home layouts/sensor configurations hinder robust HAR systems.

Method: AgentSense generates personas via LLMs, creates routines, decomposes actions, and simulates them in VirtualHome with ambient sensors.

Result: Virtual data boosts HAR performance, especially with limited real data, matching models trained on full real datasets.

Conclusion: AgentSense proves virtual data's potential to overcome HAR's data scarcity without manual collection.

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

TL;DR: A real-time feedback system for isometric exercises is introduced to address risks like incorrect posture and injury, supported by a large dataset and novel evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks of incorrect posture and injury in isometric exercises due to lack of expert supervision.

Method: Developed a real-time feedback system, released a large multiclass isometric exercise video dataset, and benchmarked state-of-the-art models with a novel three-part metric.

Result: Enhanced feasibility of intelligent, personalized exercise training systems for home workouts, with applications in rehabilitation and physiotherapy.

Conclusion: The system provides expert-level diagnosis, expanding its potential applications in fitness and rehabilitation.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

TL;DR: DISCOVR is a self-supervised dual-branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning, combining temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial semantics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SSL for echocardiography due to subtle structures, complex dynamics, and lack of domain-specific models. Existing SSL methods struggle with intersample similarity, low PSNR, or aggressive augmentations.

Method: DISCOVR uses a clustering-based video encoder for temporal dynamics and an online image encoder for spatial semantics, connected via semantic cluster distillation loss.

Result: Outperforms specialized video anomaly detection and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot, linear probing, and segmentation transfer across six datasets.

Conclusion: DISCOVR effectively addresses challenges in echocardiography SSL, achieving superior performance by combining temporal and spatial learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

*Guang Liang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPLQ introduces a fast, efficient 4-bit quantization framework for Vision Transformers, addressing limitations of PTQ and QAT with a two-stage approach, achieving competitive accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ and QAT methods for ViTs have significant drawbacks: PTQ causes accuracy drops, while QAT is computationally expensive and lacks generalization. GPLQ aims to solve these issues.

Method: GPLQ uses a two-stage strategy: Stage 1 quantizes activations while keeping weights in FP32, preserving the model's optimization basin. Stage 2 quantizes weights using PTQ.

Result: GPLQ is 100x faster than QAT, reduces memory usage below FP32, and achieves 4-bit performance competitive with FP32 models on ImageNet and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: GPLQ provides a practical, efficient solution for ViT quantization, balancing speed, accuracy, and generalization, with plans to release an open-source toolkit.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of interconnected devices and V2X communications has enhanced TD, but detecting objects accurately and efficiently remains critical for safety.

Method: The study uses the expanded SELMA dataset with ground-truth bounding boxes, evaluates compression algorithms and object detectors, and measures their impact on V2X networks.

Result: Performance of compression and detection methods is analyzed under metrics like efficiency, time, accuracy, and network impact, aligning with 3GPP requirements.

Conclusion: The work advances TD safety by optimizing object detection and compression, ensuring compliance with V2X network standards.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic evaluation of LVLMs on VLT tasks, despite their multilingual and visual capabilities. The study aims to fill this gap.

Method: The study analyzes VLT from three perspectives: (1) introduces AibTrans dataset, (2) benchmarks 17 models, and (3) proposes Density-Aware Evaluation (DA Score).

Result: Findings include OCR dependency in models, degradation of cross-lingual performance with fine-tuning, and the effectiveness of balanced multilingual fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a new VLT benchmark and proposes strategies to improve LVLM performance without losing generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Motivation: To provide a cheaper alternative to LiDAR-based 3D object detection by utilizing existing onboard cameras and focusing on all road users.

Method: Lifts 2D vision-based algorithm results to 3D using cameras, employs a 2D CNN for point cloud processing to minimize computational cost.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art image-based methods on KITTI benchmark with significantly reduced runtime (one-third).

Conclusion: Demonstrates a viable, cost-effective solution for 3D object detection in autonomous driving, broadening applicability beyond cars.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image editing is underexplored due to challenges like boundary discontinuity and projection distortions.

Method: SphereDrag uses adaptive reprojection (AR), great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA), and spherical search region tracking (SSRT) for accurate editing.

Result: SphereDrag achieves a 10.5% improvement in geometric consistency and image quality.

Conclusion: SphereDrag effectively addresses panoramic editing challenges and sets a benchmark with PanoBench.

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Result: O2Former outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in SAR ship instance segmentation.

Conclusion: O2Former effectively addresses SAR-specific challenges and demonstrates superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for aligned novel view image and geometry generation using warping-and-inpainting, with cross-modal attention distillation for alignment and proximity-based mesh conditioning for robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior methods requiring dense posed images or pose-embedded models, enabling high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis and geometrically aligned outputs.

Method: Leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors for partial geometries, formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task, and uses cross-modal attention distillation and proximity-based mesh conditioning.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity view synthesis, competitive reconstruction quality, and geometrically aligned colored point clouds for 3D completion.

Conclusion: The method effectively synthesizes novel views and geometries, ensuring alignment and robustness, with applications in comprehensive 3D scene completion.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

*Nishan Gunawardena,Gough Yumu Lui,Jeewani Anupama Ginige,Bahman Javadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A smartphone-based deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm was compared to the Tobii Pro Nano, showing comparable accuracy but higher sensitivity to factors like lighting and age.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile conditions.

Method: Used a lightweight CNN (MobileNet-V3) with LSTM to predict gaze from grayscale facial images, tested on 51 participants with dynamic stimuli.

Result: Mean error of 17.76 mm (deep learning) vs. 16.53 mm (Tobii), with higher sensitivity to lighting, vision correction, and age.

Conclusion: Appearance-based methods show promise for mobile eye tracking but require optimization for varied conditions.

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

### [175] [How Visual Representations Map to Language Feature Space in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11976)
*Constantin Venhoff,Ashkan Khakzar,Sonia Joseph,Philip Torr,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using frozen LLM and ViT with a linear adapter reveals visual-language alignment mechanisms in VLMs, showing misalignment in early layers and convergence in later ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLMs align visual and linguistic representations without fine-tuning the language model.

Method: Uses frozen LLM and ViT, training only a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning, and analyzes alignment using pre-trained SAEs.

Result: Visual representations align with language features in middle-to-later layers, indicating early-layer misalignment.

Conclusion: Current adapter-based architectures may not optimally facilitate cross-modal learning, raising questions for future research.

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework improves radiology report generation by integrating medical priors and dynamically adjusting inference depth, outperforming baselines without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning performance of vision-language large models (VLLMs) for radiology report generation without additional training.

Method: Introduces TGT framework with structured medical priors and reasoning budget forcing for dynamic inference depth adjustment.

Result: Outperforms baseline prompting methods, generates more accurate reports, and reveals dataset biases.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling with TGT and reasoning budget forcing effectively improves VLLM performance in radiology report generation.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

*Jiacong Wang,Zijiang Kang,Haochen Wang,Haiyong Jiang,Jiawen Li,Bohong Wu,Ya Wang,Jiao Ran,Xiao Liang,Chao Feng,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGR is a multimodal reasoning model that enhances visual perception for complex tasks, outperforming baselines with fewer image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of language-only reasoning in multimodal CoT tasks by improving fine-grained visual understanding.

Method: VGR detects relevant image regions, replays them for reasoning, and uses a custom SFT dataset (VGR-SFT) for training.

Result: VGR achieves +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and +12.9 on ChartQA, using 30% fewer image tokens than the baseline.

Conclusion: VGR advances multimodal reasoning by integrating visual grounding, improving performance on detail-intensive tasks.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if CT-derived body composition metrics can improve prediction of postoperative outcomes, either alone or combined with clinical variables.

Method: Used Cox proportional hazards model for 1-year mortality (C-index, IBS) and logistic regression for secondary outcomes (AUC, Brier Score). Extracted over 300 CT features (muscle, fat metrics).

Result: Evaluated predictive performance for mortality and complications using CT metrics and NSQIP scores.

Conclusion: CT-derived body composition metrics show potential for predicting postoperative outcomes after colectomy.

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

TL;DR: Affogato introduces a large-scale benchmark for affordance grounding, addressing challenges like fine-grained localization and dataset scarcity, and proposes effective vision-language models for the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of affordance grounding is critical for intelligent agents but remains challenging due to fine-grained localization needs, ambiguity in interaction regions, and lack of large datasets.

Method: The authors develop vision-language models using pretrained part-aware vision backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder, trained on the Affogato dataset.

Result: The models achieve strong performance on 2D and 3D benchmarks and demonstrate open-vocabulary cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The Affogato dataset and proposed models advance affordance grounding, with potential for broader applications in intelligent agent interactions.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

TL;DR: AA-2DGS improves 2D Gaussian Splatting by addressing aliasing artifacts with frequency constraints and a novel Mip filter, enhancing rendering quality across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS suffers from aliasing artifacts at varying sampling rates, limiting its practical use in scenarios like camera zoom or changing fields of view.

Method: Introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel for frequency constraints and a novel object space Mip filter for anti-aliasing.

Result: AA-2DGS maintains geometric accuracy while significantly reducing high-frequency artifacts when zooming in.

Conclusion: AA-2DGS enhances 2DGS's rendering quality, making it more versatile for practical applications.

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

TL;DR: A new video quality dataset and metric (CGVQM) for synthetic content distortions outperforms existing metrics, with pre-trained 3D CNNs aligning well with human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on synthetic content and modern rendering artifacts in video quality assessment.

Method: Created a dataset with distortions from advanced rendering techniques and proposed CGVQM, a full-reference metric leveraging pre-trained 3D CNNs.

Result: Existing metrics perform poorly (max Pearson correlation: 0.78), while CGVQM outperforms them, providing per-pixel error maps and global scores.

Conclusion: CGVQM is a superior metric for synthetic content quality, with dataset and implementation publicly available.

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) against grid-based methods, finding grids generally outperform INRs except for signals with lower-dimensional structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental capacity, biases, and scaling behavior of INRs compared to grid-based representations.

Method: Evaluates diverse INRs on 2D/3D signals with varying bandwidth, covering tasks like tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. Performance is stratified by model size, signal type, and bandwidth.

Result: Grids with interpolation train faster and achieve higher quality than INRs for most tasks. INRs excel only for signals with lower-dimensional structure (e.g., shape contours).

Conclusion: INRs are best suited for tasks involving lower-dimensional signals, while grids are more efficient for broader applications. Future INR use should target advantageous settings.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

TL;DR: ADAgent, an AI agent for Alzheimer's disease analysis, improves multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis by integrating a reasoning engine and medical tools, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and precise AD diagnosis is critical, but existing methods lack flexibility for multi-modal or missing data.

Method: ADAgent uses a large language model (LLM) with a reasoning engine, medical tools, and a coordinator for multi-modal tasks.

Result: ADAgent achieves a 2.7% increase in multi-modal diagnosis and 0.7% in prognosis, with improvements in MRI/PET tasks.

Conclusion: ADAgent addresses the need for flexible, multi-modal AD analysis, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: A novel framework, VeTTA, uses two Transformer-based autoencoders to learn vector representations of 3D vascular networks, reducing GPU memory needs and improving reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling tree-structured geometric data (e.g., 3D vascular networks) with high fidelity and low computational cost.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Vessel Autoencoder captures geometric details of vessel segments, (2) Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes topology using segment-level embeddings, ensuring valid tree reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms 3D convolutional models in reconstruction fidelity, topology preservation, and latent space interpolation on 2D synthetic and 3D coronary artery datasets.

Conclusion: VeTTA provides scalable, precise, and topologically consistent modeling for anatomical tree structures in medical imaging.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

*Yi Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffPR improves QPI by decoupling frequency learning, using a U-Net for low-frequency phase maps and a diffusion model for high-frequency details, outperforming U-Net baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address oversmoothing and spectral bias in deep learning for QPI by avoiding high-frequency skip connections in U-Nets and using a diffusion model for detail synthesis.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses a U-Net without high-frequency skips for low-frequency phase maps; Stage 2 refines with a diffusion model for high-frequency details.

Result: DiffPR boosts PSNR by 1.1 dB, reduces MAE by 11%, and delivers sharper features compared to U-Net baselines.

Conclusion: Cancelling high-level skips and using a diffusion model effectively mitigates spectral bias in phase-retrieval networks.

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

*Joakim Andén,Justus Sagemüller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A transformer-based neural network improves cryo-EM image denoising by clustering, aligning, and denoising simultaneously, outperforming single-image DNNs by 45% in MSE at low SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNNs are limited in high-noise settings like cryo-EM. Leveraging redundancy in cryo-EM datasets, the paper aims to enhance denoising by combining clustering, alignment, and denoising.

Method: The paper introduces a transformer-based neural network that clusters, aligns, and denoises cryo-EM images simultaneously.

Result: The method reduces relative MSE by 45% compared to single-image DNNs at an SNR of 0.03.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses high-noise challenges in cryo-EM by integrating traditional class averaging with modern deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality, and precise segmentation of coronary arteries from ICA is crucial for clinical decision-making.

Method: FAD-Net integrates a frequency-domain attention mechanism and cascading diffusion strategy, using Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA) and Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) for enhanced segmentation.

segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

*Chunlei Li,Yilei Shi,Haoxi Hu,Jingliang Hu,Xiao Xiang Zhu,Lichao Mou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework adapts Stable Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution, outperforming existing methods by leveraging synthetic low-quality images and text descriptions for high-quality imaging at reduced radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between image quality and patient safety in high-resolution CT imaging by overcoming challenges in deep learning methods for super-resolution.

Method: Uses a practical degradation model to synthesize low-quality images, a pre-trained vision-language model for text descriptions, and Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling strategy for super-resolution.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, enabling high-quality CT imaging with reduced radiation exposure.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates significant potential for improving CT imaging quality while minimizing patient risk.

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Zhaoyang Wang,Jie Li,Wen Lu,Lihuo He,Maoguo Gong,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient CVSR method inspired by HSI similarities, reducing complexity and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges like slow inference, complex training, and limited inter-frame exploitation in SOTA CVSR models.

Method: Uses compression-driven dimensionality reduction and modular architecture for integration with existing VSR frameworks.

Result: Matches or surpasses SOTA performance with significantly reduced inference time.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, efficient solution for advancing VSR technology, with code publicly available.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

*Yifei Tang,Hongjie Jiang,Changhong Jing,Hieu Pham,Shuqiang Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fine-tuned brain network model is proposed for brain disease diagnosis, enhancing generalizability by expanding brain region representations across multiple dimensions and leveraging self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for brain networks are limited to single dimensions, restricting their broader neuroscience applications.

Method: The model includes an adapter module for multi-dimensional feature expansion and a fine-tuned foundation model using self-supervised learning and transformer blocks for feature extraction.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a promising approach for advancing brain network analysis research.

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

### [191] [Exploring the Effectiveness of Deep Features from Domain-Specific Foundation Models in Retinal Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11753)
*Zuzanna Skorniewska,Bartlomiej W. Papiez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores deep generative models for synthetic medical imaging, focusing on retinal fundus images. It evaluates domain-specific loss functions and finds edge-detection filters more effective than deep features for vascular structure sharpness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy, data scarcity, and biases in medical imaging hinder neural network adoption. Synthetic data via generative models can address these issues, but validation for clinical accuracy is critical.

Method: The study compares distance-based loss (using deep activation layers) with perceptual and edge-detection losses for generating retinal images. Validation includes domain-free and domain-specific tasks.

Result: Domain-specific deep features did not improve image generation. Edge-detection filters enhanced vascular structure sharpness in synthetic samples.

Conclusion: Conventional edge-detection filters outperform domain-specific deep features for generating clinically accurate retinal images, offering a practical solution for synthetic data creation.

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a framework integrating multiscale biomechanical data for personalized MSD management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MSDs are a major cause of disability, requiring advanced tools for diagnosis and treatment. The DT paradigm is ideal for integrating heterogeneous data.

Method: MS-DT combines motion capture, ultrasound, electromyography, and medical imaging with computational modeling for patient-specific musculoskeletal representation.

Result: MS-DT effectively extracts precise kinematic and dynamic tissue features, aiding spine biomechanics monitoring and rehabilitation.

Conclusion: The MS-DT framework enhances patient-specific diagnosis and intervention planning through high-fidelity modeling and real-time visualization.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity
modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and
intervention planning.

### [193] [Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11823)
*Zhangkai Ni,Yang Zhang,Wenhan Yang,Hanli Wang,Shiqi Wang,Sam Kwong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding (SSIU) method for efficient image super-resolution, combining data-driven and model-driven approaches to improve performance while maintaining model compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven super-resolution methods increase model complexity by expanding receptive fields through deeper networks or transformers. Model-driven methods, however, show promise in balancing performance and compactness.

Method: The SSIU method unfolds an optimization function constrained by structural similarity, using Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and Efficient Sparse Attention Modules (ESAM) in each iteration, along with a Mixture-of-Experts-based Feature Selector (MoE-FS).

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: The SSIU method effectively combines data-driven and model-driven strengths, offering a compact and efficient solution for image super-resolution.

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MindGrab is a parameter- and memory-efficient deep fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images, outperforming classical methods and matching SynthStrip with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly efficient and accurate deep learning model for skull-stripping in head images across modalities, reducing computational demands.

Method: Developed MindGrab using a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, trained on modality-agnostic synthetic data, and evaluated on 606 multimodal scans.

Result: Achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9, outperforming ROBEX and BET, and matching SynthStrip with 95% fewer parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: MindGrab offers state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly lower resource demands, making it accessible on diverse hardware.

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The crossMoDA challenge series focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation for Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea, evolving over years to enhance clinical relevance. Findings show improved outlier reduction with dataset expansion, though cochlea segmentation declined in 2023.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate VS and cochlea segmentation on T2 MRI for cost-effective VS management, addressing extreme domain shifts.

Method: Unsupervised cross-modality segmentation from ceT1 to T2 MRI, evolving from single-institutional to multi-institutional and heterogeneous data.

Result: Outliers decreased with dataset expansion, but cochlea Dice score declined in 2023 due to added complexity. The 2023 winning approach improved performance on older data.

Conclusion: Progress is noted, but a more challenging cross-modal task may be needed for future benchmarking as performance plateaus.

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

TL;DR: The paper explores eye-tracking and machine learning for early dyslexia detection, achieving 88.58% accuracy with a Random Forest Classifier and hierarchical clustering for severity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dyslexia affects 10-20% of the population, necessitating accessible diagnostic methods. The study aims to provide a cost-effective, non-invasive solution using eye-tracking and machine learning.

Method: Combined eye-tracking technology with machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to analyze eye movement patterns (fixation durations, saccades) and hierarchical clustering for severity assessment.

Result: Achieved 88.58% accuracy in dyslexia detection and identified varying severity levels through clustering.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking with machine learning offers a highly accurate, accessible, and non-invasive diagnostic tool for dyslexia, including borderline cases.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces zero-shot-s², a task-aligned prompting method for detecting AI-generated images using pre-trained VLMs, improving performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of supervised detection methods for AI-generated images, which struggle with generalization across diverse generators.

Method: Uses pre-trained VLMs with task-aligned prompting (zero-shot-s²) to enhance detection performance, avoiding the need for large datasets or fine-tuning.

Result: Zero-shot-s² boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29% across diverse datasets and models, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: Task-aligned prompting enhances VLM capabilities for AI-generated image detection, offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalVLBench, a benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) on visual causal reasoning tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of LVLMs in tasks like recognition and VQA, their potential in visual causal reasoning remains underexplored. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: The authors propose CausalVLBench, a benchmark with three tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction, evaluated on three datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art LVLMs are assessed, revealing their fundamental strengths and weaknesses in visual causal reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark aims to highlight limitations of current LVLMs and inspire improvements in their visual causal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable version of Tversky's similarity model for deep learning, replacing geometric similarity with feature-based similarity, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometric similarity models in deep learning lack psychological plausibility, unlike Tversky's feature-based model, which better aligns with human perception.

Method: Developed a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity, creating neural network components like the Tversky projection layer, and tested it in image recognition and language tasks.

Result: Achieved significant improvements: 24.7% accuracy boost in image classification and 7.5% perplexity reduction in language modeling, with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The Tversky projection layer offers a psychologically plausible, interpretable, and effective alternative to traditional geometric similarity in deep learning.

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention

organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research

Motivation: To investigate how algorithmic lookism affects synthetic faces and gender classification, highlighting potential biases in digital identity systems.

Method: Experiments with 13,200 synthetically generated faces, analyzing text-to-image systems and gender classification models.

Result: T2I systems link attractiveness to unrelated positive traits, and gender models have higher error rates for less-attractive, non-White women.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fairness issues in digital identity systems due to algorithmic lookism.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital
identity systems.

### [202] [ADAMIX: Adaptive Mixed-Precision Delta-Compression with Quantization Error Optimization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11087)
*Boya Xiong,Shuo Wang,Weifeng Ge,Guanhua Chen,Yun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAMIX is an adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework for LLMs, outperforming baselines by optimizing bit allocation to minimize quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing delta-compression methods for LLMs either perform poorly at high compression ratios or rely on empirical bit allocation, lacking theoretical grounding.

Method: ADAMIX uses a mathematical derivation of quantization error to formulate an optimal mixed-precision bit allocation as a 0/1 integer linear programming problem.

Result: ADAMIX surpasses baselines, improving performance by 22.3% and 6.1% on AIME2024 and GQA tasks with 7B models.

Conclusion: ADAMIX provides a theoretically grounded, effective solution for delta-compression in LLMs, achieving superior performance at high compression ratios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

*Huiling Zhu,Yingqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SectorE is a novel embedding model using polar coordinates to improve knowledge graph completion by capturing semantic hierarchies, outperforming others on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing region-based embedding models often ignore semantic hierarchies in entities, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge graph completion.

Method: SectorE embeds entities as points and relations as annular sectors in polar coordinates, combining modulus and phase to capture inference patterns and relation attributes.

Result: SectorE achieves competitive performance on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, showcasing strong semantic modeling.

Conclusion: SectorE effectively addresses the semantic hierarchy gap in knowledge graph completion, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

### [204] [LoRA Users Beware: A Few Spurious Tokens Can Manipulate Your Finetuned Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11402)
*Pradyut Sekhsaria,Marcel Mateos Salles,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT methods like LoRA can cause models to rely on spurious tokens for decision-making, enabling control via SSTI, with varying effects based on LoRA rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate catastrophic failures in PEFT methods, particularly the reliance on spurious tokens and the potential for SSTI attacks.

Method: Applied SSTI across three model families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, Meta LLaMA-3) and four datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, Bias in Bios) to study model behavior.

Result: Found that SSTI can control models with minimal tokens, reliance on spurious tokens scales with LoRA rank, and larger ranks improve robustness against aggressive SSTI.

Conclusion: PEFT's efficiency comes with risks of spurious token reliance, highlighting the need for robustness considerations in fine-tuning.

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

### [205] [Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11415)
*Linlin Wang,Tianqing Zhu,Laiqiao Qin,Longxiang Gao,Wanlei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework to show how poisoning attacks in RAG systems amplify biases in large language models, proposes a defense mechanism, and highlights the need for fairness in RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research overlooks how poisoning attacks in RAG systems can amplify model biases, particularly in sensitive topics like gender stereotypes.

Method: The BRRA framework uses adversarial document generation, subspace projection, and cyclic feedback to manipulate retrieval results and amplify biases. Experiments validate its impact on multiple models.

Result: BRRA attacks significantly enhance model biases, and a dual-stage defense mechanism is proposed to mitigate these effects.

Conclusion: Poisoning attacks in RAG systems amplify biases, linking system security to model fairness, necessitating attention to fairness in RAG design.

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

### [206] [RollingQ: Reviving the Cooperation Dynamics in Multimodal Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11465)
*Haotian Ni,Yake Wei,Hang Liu,Gong Chen,Chong Peng,Hao Lin,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a bias in self-attention models where one modality is overemphasized, proposes RollingQ to restore dynamic adaptability, and validates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in multimodal learning due to varying modality quality and diminishing adaptability of self-attention models.

Method: Introduces Rolling Query (RollingQ) to balance attention allocation by rotating queries.

Result: RollingQ effectively restores dynamic adaptability and improves multimodal Transformer performance.

Conclusion: RollingQ is pivotal for enhancing multimodal Transformer capabilities by mitigating bias and reviving adaptability.

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source

*Chengye Li,Haiyun Liu,Yuanxi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper interprets in-context learning (ICL) as implicit knowledge distillation (KD), providing a theoretical framework to explain its mechanisms and derive generalization bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanism behind ICL is poorly understood, limiting its interpretability, improvement, and reliable application.

Method: The authors propose viewing ICL as implicit KD, deriving a Rademacher complexity-based generalization bound and analyzing bias growth with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).

Result: The framework explains empirical phenomena and unifies prior analyses, formalizing inference-time attention as distillation.

Conclusion: This work offers theoretical insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection in ICL.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

*Zhenyu Hou,Ziniu Hu,Yujiang Li,Rui Lu,Jie Tang,Yuxiao Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeRL integrates on-policy tree search into RL training for LLMs, improving exploration and efficiency without needing a separate reward model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL with chain sampling lacks efficient exploration and suffers from reward model issues like distribution mismatch.

Method: TreeRL uses on-policy tree search with intermediate supervision and strategic branching from high-uncertainty steps.

Result: TreeRL outperforms ChainRL on math and code reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TreeRL demonstrates the effectiveness of tree search in LLM RL and is open-sourced for further use.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

*Dibya Ghosh,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores casting self-supervised image pre-training as an RL problem, using a general value function to learn features from unlabeled data like web crawls and video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between RL and self-supervised learning by treating image pre-training as an RL problem, leveraging similarities in feature association.

Method: Train a general value function in a dynamical system where an agent transforms images (e.g., changing views or augmentations), resembling crop-consistency self-supervision but with added reward shaping.

Result: Improved representations when training on unlabeled image datasets like EpicKitchens, COCO, and CC12M.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates RL with self-supervised learning, offering a flexible way to shape feature learning using curated or weakly labeled data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

*Paul Setinek,Gianluca Galletti,Thomas Gross,Dominik Schnürer,Johannes Brandstetter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIMSHIFT, a benchmark for evaluating neural surrogates in PDEs under domain shifts, and adapts DA techniques to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural surrogates for PDEs struggle with unseen configurations, while DA techniques in vision/language show promise for generalization.

Method: Extends DA methods to neural surrogates, using parametric descriptions and simulations from source configurations to predict target simulations.

Result: Experiments on SIMSHIFT reveal challenges and potential of DA for robust neural surrogates in industrial simulations.

Conclusion: Highlights open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts, with code available for further research.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

*Hsi-Che Lin,Yu-Chu Yu,Kai-Po Chang,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMLoC is a memory-efficient framework for fine-tuning large foundation models, using an emulator and LoRA correction to stay within inference memory limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large models is costly in memory, limiting accessibility for domain-specific or personalized tasks.

Method: EMLoC uses activation-aware SVD to create a lightweight emulator, fine-tunes it with LoRA, and corrects misalignment for merging back into the original model.

Result: EMLoC outperforms baselines across datasets and enables fine-tuning a 38B model on a 24GB GPU.

Conclusion: EMLoC provides a practical and efficient solution for individual users to adapt large models.

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unclear impact of anisotropy in pretrained speech representations on downstream tasks like keyword spotting.

Method: Uses Dynamic Time Warping to assess wav2vec2 similarity measures in keyword spotting for computational documentary linguistics.

Result: Despite anisotropy, wav2vec2 effectively identifies words without transcription, capturing phonetic structures and generalizing across speakers.

Conclusion: Pretraining is crucial for learning rich and invariant speech representations, as demonstrated by the robustness of wav2vec2.

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLAP methods are limited to English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. GLAP aims to bridge this gap.

Method: GLAP expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain capabilities, evaluated on benchmarks like Clotho, AudioCaps, and speech tasks.

Result: GLAP achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks and excels in multilingual speech retrieval, classification, and sound-event tasks.

Conclusion: GLAP demonstrates superior multilingual and multi-domain performance, making it a versatile solution for audio-text tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SimPhon Speech Test, a computational method to design a phonetically balanced speech test for hearing loss diagnosis, outperforming traditional audiometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audiometry inadequately assesses speech understanding in hearing loss, especially for supra-threshold deficits in presbycusis.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline using ASR to simulate hearing loss, identify phoneme confusions, curate word pairs, and optimize a final set of 25 test items.

Result: The SimPhon Speech Test-25 shows no correlation with the Speech Intelligibility Index, capturing deficits beyond audibility.

Conclusion: The method offers efficient test development, ready for human trials.

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes PMF-CEC, an improved method over ED-CEC for ASR postprocessing, addressing rare word recognition and homophone errors, and introduces a retention probability mechanism to reduce overdetection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving ASR accuracy for rare words and homophones, and reducing overdetection in error correction.

Method: Phoneme-augmented multimodal fusion (PMF-CEC) and retention probability mechanism for filtering low-confidence edits.

Result: PMF-CEC reduces biased word error rate, outperforms ED-CEC and other methods, and maintains fast inference.

Conclusion: PMF-CEC is effective for rare word correction, especially homophones, and offers robustness and speed advantages.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

*Tao Zhong,Mengzhe Geng,Shujie Hu,Guinan Li,Xunying Liu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores regularized federated learning (FL) techniques to improve dysarthric and elderly speech recognition, addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns and challenges like data scarcity, imbalanced distribution, and speaker heterogeneity in dysarthric and elderly speech recognition motivate the shift to FL and the need for regularization.

Method: The study investigates three FL regularization techniques: parameter-based, embedding-based, and novel loss-based regularization.

Result: Regularized FL systems outperformed the baseline FedAvg system, achieving significant WER reductions (up to 0.55% absolute, 2.13% relative). Higher communication frequency neared centralized training performance.

Conclusion: Regularized FL effectively addresses privacy and performance challenges in dysarthric and elderly speech recognition, with potential for further optimization.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Motivation: Concerns about reproducibility and fairness in machine learning models due to unvalidated speech processing tools in diverse contexts.

Method: Evaluation of speech features from OpenSMILE and Praat for adolescents with autism, assessing reliability and model performance.

Result: Significant variation in features across tools, affecting model performance and fairness across demographics.

Conclusion: Domain-relevant verification is needed to improve reliability of machine learning models in clinical settings.

audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

TL;DR: A multimodal approach using Whisper and LLMs improves child speech recognition and reading mistake detection, achieving a 5.1% WER and F1 score of 0.73.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support teachers by automating reading aloud evaluation, addressing limited research in this area.

Method: Combines Whisper and instruction-tuned LLMs with prompts for better transcriptions and mistake detection.

Result: Achieved 5.1% WER (vs. 9.4% baseline) and F1 score of 0.73 (vs. 0.39 baseline).

Conclusion: Prompting Whisper and LLMs enhances child speech recognition and reading evaluation.

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers
by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on
reading evaluation systems and applications remains limited. We present a novel
multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child
speech recognition, as well as their effectiveness in downstream reading
mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without
prompting. The best performing system achieved state-of-the-art recognition
performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER) of 5.1%,
improving the baseline WER of 9.4%. Furthermore, it significantly improved
reading mistake detection, increasing the F1 score from 0.39 to 0.73.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A unified multi-ASR prompt-driven framework using LLMs for postprocessing improves transcription accuracy and semi-supervised ASR training compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generating pseudo-labels in ASR rely on complex pipelines with error propagation and disjoint optimization.

Method: Proposes a unified framework combining multiple ASR outputs with LLM postprocessing (textual or speech-based) instead of voting or arbitration logic.

Result: Shows significant improvements in transcription accuracy and better performance in semi-supervised ASR training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms traditional methods, offering a more efficient and accurate approach for pseudo-label generation in ASR.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

### [220] [Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organising Systems through Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796)
*Elias Najarro,Nicolas Bessone,Sebastian Risi*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: A novel inverse modeling method for stochastic self-organizing systems uses visual embeddings to recover causal parameters without handcrafted metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding natural complexity requires solving the inverse problem of finding causal parameters from stochastic macroscopic observations, where traditional methods fail.

Method: The method leverages visual embeddings to map pattern representations onto an invariant space, enabling robust parameter recovery despite stochasticity.

Result: Tested on reaction-diffusion and agent-based models, the method reliably recovers parameters and works on real biological patterns.

Conclusion: The approach is a valuable tool for studying stochastic pattern formation in theory and experiments.

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A real-world lane-change prediction system using Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Bayesian inference, validated on hardware, predicts maneuvers 3-4 seconds early for safer reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between algorithmic advances and real-world deployment in lane-change prediction.

Method: Combines perception (environment sensing and feature conversion) and prediction (KGEs and Bayesian inference) modules to anticipate maneuvers and trigger braking.

Result: Predicts lane changes 3-4 seconds in advance, enabling safe reactions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective real-world deployment of lane-change prediction for enhanced safety.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

*Jianhong Yao,Yangming Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) combining fuzzy inference and quantum circuits for robust, efficient, and interpretable image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of deep learning in handling noisy inputs and lack of confidence explanation, while leveraging quantum efficiency and fuzzy transparency.

Method: HQFNN integrates fuzzy logic into a shallow quantum circuit, mapping features to qubits, refining them with a rule layer, and fusing with classical features for classification.

Result: HQFNN outperforms classical, fuzzy-enhanced, and quantum-only baselines with fewer weights and maintains accuracy under noise.

Conclusion: HQFNN offers a compact, interpretable, and noise-tolerant alternative for vision tasks, paving the way for quantum-native fuzzy learning.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines how iterative LLM feedback increases security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code, showing a 37.6% rise in critical vulnerabilities after five iterations. It challenges the assumption of improved security through refinement and advocates for human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how security vulnerabilities evolve in AI-generated code through iterative LLM feedback, given the lack of attention to this issue despite widespread LLM adoption.

Method: A controlled experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of improvements using four distinct prompting strategies.

Result: A 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after five iterations, with distinct patterns emerging across prompting approaches.

Conclusion: Iterative LLM refinement does not inherently improve code security; human validation is crucial to mitigate risks and prevent new vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMirage is a benchmark for detecting AI-generated code, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by covering 10 languages, paraphrased samples, and outputs from 10 advanced LLMs. It evaluates 10 detectors, revealing key insights for future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of LLMs in code generation poses risks like plagiarism and security vulnerabilities, necessitating robust detection methods. Existing benchmarks lack comprehensiveness, motivating the creation of CodeMirage.

Method: CodeMirage spans 10 programming languages, includes original and paraphrased code, and uses outputs from 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. It evaluates detectors across four paradigms under realistic conditions.

Result: The benchmark evaluates 10 detectors, uncovering strengths and weaknesses through nine key findings, highlighting challenges for future work.

Conclusion: CodeMirage provides a rigorous testbed for advancing AI-generated code detection, addressing current limitations and guiding future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Brent Paulovicks,Vadim Sheinin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating and refining Bash code in IT Automation, achieving high accuracy and significant improvements in code refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve code quality and model selection for automatic incident remediation by ensuring syntactic, semantic, and functional correctness of generated code.

Method: Enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge with bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation, validated against execution-based evaluation.

Result: High accuracy (up to 8% over baseline) and significant improvement (up to 24%) in code refinement using Reflection code agents.

Conclusion: The enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge method is effective for reference-less validation and refinement of Bash code in IT Automation.

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

TL;DR: The paper revisits claims of LLMs outperforming elite humans in competitive programming, introducing LiveCodeBench Pro to benchmark performance. Findings show LLMs still lag in nuanced reasoning, with a 53% pass rate on medium problems and 0% on hard ones, driven by implementation precision, not superior reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs truly outperform elite humans in competitive programming and identify their limitations compared to human experts.

Method: Introduces LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark with problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI, annotated by Olympiad medalists. Analyzes model-generated submissions line-by-line.

Result: Frontier models achieve 53% pass@1 on medium problems and 0% on hard ones, excelling in implementation but failing at nuanced reasoning and case analysis.

Conclusion: LLMs still fall short of human grandmaster levels in competitive programming, with performance driven by tools and implementation, not reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro provides diagnostics for future improvements.

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: SAE-BrainMap aligns deep learning visual models with fMRI responses using sparse autoencoders, revealing strong correlations and hierarchical mapping between model layers and the human visual pathway.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge deep neural networks and the human visual cortex without relying on downstream tasks, enhancing model interpretability.

Method: Train layer-wise sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on model activations, correlate SAE unit activations with fMRI signals, and construct a voxel dictionary for hierarchical mapping.

Result: Strong activation correspondence (similarity up to 0.76), preservation of functional ROI structure, and visualization of dynamic visual information transformation in models.

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap provides a direct, task-free link between deep learning models and the human visual cortex, advancing interpretability.

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding brain dynamics is crucial for neuroscience and mental health, and fMRI provides a way to measure neural activities via BOLD signals.

Method: Proposes a 4D Swin Transformer encoder to learn spatio-temporal fMRI data and a convolutional decoder for high-resolution brain state prediction.

Result: The model accurately predicts 7.2s resting-state brain activities from prior 23.04s fMRI data, closely matching BOLD contrast and dynamics.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the Swin Transformer's ability to learn high-resolution spatiotemporal brain organization, offering potential for reduced fMRI scan time and brain-computer interface development.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaussMarker, a dual-domain watermarking approach for Diffusion Models (DM) that embeds watermarks in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing robustness against manipulations and attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing copyright and misuse concerns in DM-generated images, current single-domain watermarking methods lack robustness.

Method: Proposes a pipelined injector for dual-domain watermarking and a Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine noise and improve detection.

Result: GaussMarker outperforms existing methods under various distortions and attacks, achieving better recall and lower false positives.

Conclusion: GaussMarker is a robust and efficient solution for watermarking DM-generated images, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

TL;DR: This paper surveys knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) tasks, categorizing them into six types, and provides a comprehensive review of downstream applications and challenging paradigms, including the impact of advanced techniques like LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic review covering all KGR tasks, including downstream applications and advanced reasoning paradigms, and to highlight future research directions.

Method: Categorizes KGR approaches based on reasoning tasks, downstream applications, and challenging paradigms, and explores advanced techniques like LLMs.

Result: A comprehensive overview of KGR tasks, applications, and trends, emphasizing the role of LLMs and future directions.

Conclusion: The survey fills gaps in existing reviews, offers insights into KGR advancements, and suggests promising future research avenues.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential

*Weibing Zheng,Laurah Turner,Jess Kropczynski,Murat Ozer,Tri Nguyen,Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge, combining fuzzy logic and LLMs to automate and align clinical communication skills evaluation with physician preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical communication skills are vital but challenging to assess at scale. Existing LLM-powered simulations lack nuanced alignment with physician judgment.

Method: The approach involves data collection, annotation using fuzzy sets (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, Contextual Distraction), prompt engineering, and fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80% accuracy, with key criteria exceeding 90%, offering interpretable, human-aligned evaluations.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of fuzzy logic and LLMs for scalable, nuanced clinical assessments, advancing medical education evaluation.

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

### [234] [Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11375)
*Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Qingyang Mao,Yucong Luo,Qi Liu,Yupeng Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Deguang Liu,Xin Li,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemTable is a new benchmark for chemical tables, addressing multimodal and domain-specific complexities in chemistry. It evaluates table recognition and understanding, revealing gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the complexity of chemical tables, limiting multimodal models' ability to support scientific chemistry understanding.

Method: ChemTable is a large-scale benchmark with expert-annotated data, supporting table recognition (parsing, extraction) and understanding (QA tasks).

Result: Models perform reasonably on layout parsing but lag in QA tasks compared to humans, with notable gaps between open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: ChemTable highlights challenges in chemistry-aware table understanding and serves as a rigorous benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study tested LLM-powered conversational agents to support family caregivers' mental health using PST, MI, and BCA. The best models combined Few-Shot and RAG techniques, showing improved empathy and therapeutic alliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mental health challenges of family caregivers by leveraging LLMs for evidence-based support.

Method: Conducted a within-subject experiment with 28 caregivers evaluating four LLM configurations, integrating PST, MI, and BCA.

Result: Best models (Few-Shot + RAG) improved empathy and therapeutic alliance, offering personalized support and actionable strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for empathetic, tailored caregiver support, though balancing assessment and advice remains challenging.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

*Yu Wang,Shiwan Zhao,Ming Fan,Zhihu Wang,Yubo Zhang,Xicheng Zhang,Zhengfan Wang,Heyuan Huang,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+ enhances RAG by integrating application-aware reasoning, improving performance by 3-5% on average and up to 7.5% in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG paradigms lack explicit application of retrieved knowledge, creating a gap in task-specific reasoning.

Method: RAG+ introduces a dual corpus of knowledge and application examples, retrieved jointly during inference to enable structured reasoning.

Result: RAG+ outperforms standard RAG, with average gains of 3-5% and peak improvements of 7.5% in complex domains.

Conclusion: RAG+ bridges retrieval and application, advancing a more interpretable and capable framework for LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

### [237] [VLM@school -- Evaluation of AI image understanding on German middle school knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11604)
*René Peinl,Vincent Tischler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new German-language benchmark dataset evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on visual reasoning tasks tied to middle school curricula, revealing poor performance (under 45% accuracy) and highlighting gaps in real-world multimodal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of non-English benchmarks for VLMs and evaluate their ability to integrate visual and factual reasoning in real-world educational contexts.

Method: The dataset includes 2,000+ open-ended questions based on 486 images from nine middle school domains. Thirteen VLMs were tested on domain-specific accuracy and adversarial questions.

Result: Top models scored under 45% accuracy, with weaknesses in music, math, and adversarial settings. Performance gaps between benchmarks and real-world tasks were evident.

Conclusion: Middle school tasks are valuable for testing VLMs, especially in non-English settings. The dataset provides a rigorous tool for improving AI's multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

*Margot Geerts,Manon Reusens,Bart Baesens,Seppe vanden Broucke,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs democratize real estate insights by generating interpretable house price estimates using optimized In-Context Learning, though they lag in spatial reasoning and overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address information asymmetry in the real estate market by leveraging LLMs for accessible and interpretable price estimates.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs on international housing datasets using zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques.

Result: LLMs produce meaningful estimates using hedonic variables and offer interpretability, but struggle with spatial reasoning and overconfidence.

Conclusion: LLMs improve transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights, though careful prompt optimization is needed.

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how Transformers-based systems learn demographic biases in AI-based recruitment and proposes a privacy-enhancing framework to mitigate gender bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical concerns like demographic biases in LLMs, especially in high-stake settings like automated recruitment.

Method: Proposes a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce gender information in the learning pipeline and tests it on two LLMs.

Result: The framework effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing data biases.

Conclusion: The proposed method mitigates bias in LLMs, enhancing ethical deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

*Claudio Fanconi,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cascaded LLM decision framework balances correctness, cost, and confidence by delegating tasks to base models, larger models, or humans, improving accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize human-AI decision-making by balancing prediction correctness, cost, and confidence in abstaining or involving experts.

Method: A two-stage cascaded framework: deferral policy for model switching and abstention policy for human intervention, with online learning from feedback.

Result: Outperforms single-model baselines in accuracy, reduces costs, and handles abstentions effectively in QA tasks.

Conclusion: The cascaded approach is effective for adaptive task delegation, improving decision quality while managing costs and confidence.

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Schema-R1 improves schema linking in Text-to-SQL tasks using reinforcement learning, achieving 10% better filter accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current schema linking models lack reasoning ability due to rote-learning and lack of high-quality reasoning samples.

Method: Schema-R1 uses three steps: constructing reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning.

Result: 10% improvement in filter accuracy over existing methods.

Conclusion: Schema-R1 effectively enhances reasoning ability in schema linking.

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing recommendation foundation models, such as neglecting embedding tasks and struggling with multi-task learning complexities.

Method: Introduces RecFound with a comprehensive dataset, TMoLE for knowledge sharing, S2Sched for convergence, and Model Merge for task balance.

Result: RecFound outperforms baselines, achieving top performance across diverse recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: RecFound successfully addresses key challenges in recommendation foundation models, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming
existing baselines.

Motivation: To develop a robust and generalizable autonomous driving model for long-tail scenarios using scalable vision-language-trajectory (VLT) pretraining and lightweight RL fine-tuning.

Method: 1. Self-supervised VLT pretraining (Poutine-Base) on nominal and long-tail driving data. 2. Fine-tuning with GRPO using minimal preference-labeled frames.

Result: Poutine-Base achieves RFS 8.12 (close to expert ground-truth). Final Poutine model scores RFS 7.99, winning the 2025 Waymo challenge.

Conclusion: Scalable VLT pretraining and lightweight RL fine-tuning are effective for robust autonomous driving in long-tail scenarios.

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025
Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These
results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL

TL;DR: Gondola is a vision-language planning model using LLMs for robotic manipulation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in generalization across unseen objects, environments, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalizing robotic manipulation across diverse language instructions and visual environments, where existing LLM-based methods struggle with grounded plans and precise object grounding.

Method: Gondola leverages multi-view images and history plans to generate action plans with interleaved texts and segmentation masks, trained on datasets from RLBench simulator.

Result: Gondola surpasses current LLM-based methods in generalization across novel placements, rigid objects, articulated objects, and long-horizon tasks on the GemBench dataset.

Conclusion: Gondola demonstrates superior generalization in robotic manipulation, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view inputs and grounded planning.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

*Rongfei Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-robot control system and camera location optimization algorithm are proposed to reduce uncertainties and noise in automated manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans outperform robots in high-precision tasks due to sensory cues, but uncertainties in manufacturing (e.g., noise, model inaccuracy) persist. Advanced sensors and control algorithms can mitigate these issues.

Method: Developed a multi-robot control system for fastening/unfastening tasks and a novel algorithm to optimize camera location for minimal image noise.

Result: The system reduces uncertainties in manufacturing tasks, and the camera algorithm minimizes noise by finding optimal observation locations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer cost-effective solutions to enhance precision and reduce uncertainties in robotic manufacturing.

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.
