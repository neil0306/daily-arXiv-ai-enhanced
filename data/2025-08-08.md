### [1] [Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04795)
*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enriching dialogue transcriptions with metadata tags for speaker characteristics (age, gender, emotion) using frozen audio and language models without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dialogue transcriptions by adding speaker metadata, enhancing readability and context without task-specific model training.

Method: Uses frozen audio foundation models (Whisper, WavLM) and a frozen LLAMA language model with lightweight connectors to infer speaker attributes.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in speaker profiling and an 8.8% Equal Error Rate in x-vector comparisons.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enriches transcriptions with speaker metadata while maintaining modularity and efficiency.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

### [2] [Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04796)
*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parity-aware BPE improves tokenization fairness across languages without compromising global compression or downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inequalities in tokenization for lower-resource languages caused by frequency-based algorithms.

Method: Introduces Parity-aware BPE, which prioritizes compression gain for the worst-compressed language at each merge step.

Result: More equitable token counts across languages, minimal impact on global compression, and no significant effect on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE effectively balances fairness and performance in multilingual tokenization.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

### [3] [Pitch Accent Detection improves Pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04814)
*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Joint ASR and pitch accent detection model improves ASR performance and pitch accent detection, reducing WER by 28.3% and closing F1-score gap by 41%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR systems by incorporating prosodic cues like pitch accent, leveraging semi-supervised speech representations.

Method: Introduces a joint model combining ASR and pitch accent detection, fine-tuned under limited resources.

Result: Pitch accent detection improves by 41% in F1-score; ASR WER decreases by 28.3% on LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: Extending pretrained speech models to include prosodic cues like pitch accent significantly boosts performance.

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

### [4] [Persistent Instability in LLM's Personality Measurements: Effects of Scale, Reasoning, and Conversation History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04826)
*Tommaso Tosato,Saskia Helbling,Yorguin-Jose Mantilla-Ramos,Mahmood Hegazy,Alberto Tosato,David John Lemay,Irina Rish,Guillaume Dumas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERSIST evaluates personality stability in large language models (LLMs), revealing significant variability despite interventions, challenging assumptions about behavioral consistency for safe deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding personality-like traits in LLMs is crucial for safe deployment, yet these traits remain poorly understood.

Method: PERSIST evaluates 25+ open-source models using traditional and LLM-adapted personality instruments, testing factors like question order, paraphrasing, personas, and reasoning modes.

Result: Key findings: (1) High response variability even in large models; (2) Prompt reordering shifts personality measurements; (3) Interventions increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted instruments show instability.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack foundations for genuine behavioral consistency, suggesting personality-based alignment strategies may be inadequate for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

### [5] [RCR-Router: Efficient Role-Aware Context Routing for Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Structured Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04903)
*Jun Liu,Zhenglun Kong,Changdi Yang,Fan Yang,Tianqi Li,Peiyan Dong,Joannah Nanjekye,Hao Tang,Geng Yuan,Wei Niu,Wenbin Zhang,Pu Zhao,Xue Lin,Dong Huang,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCR-Router is a dynamic, role-aware context routing framework for multi-agent LLMs, reducing token usage by up to 30% while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coordination schemes in multi-agent LLMs are inefficient due to static routing, leading to high token consumption and limited adaptability.

Method: RCR-Router dynamically selects relevant memory subsets per agent based on role and task stage, guided by a lightweight scoring policy and iterative memory refinement.

Result: Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show reduced token usage (up to 30%) with maintained or improved answer quality.

Conclusion: Structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation are key for scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

### [6] [I Think, Therefore I Am Under-Qualified? A Benchmark for Evaluating Linguistic Shibboleth Detection in LLM Hiring Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04939)
*Julia Kharchenko,Tanya Roosta,Aman Chadha,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating LLMs' responses to linguistic shibboleths reveals biases, particularly against hedging language, with a 25.6% lower rating impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect and measure demographic bias in LLMs through subtle linguistic markers.

Method: Uses 100 validated question-response pairs in interview simulations to isolate linguistic variations while maintaining semantic equivalence.

Result: Hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, highlighting systematic bias.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a framework for detecting linguistic discrimination in AI, aiding fairness in automated decision-making.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [7] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A vision-language clustering framework is proposed to address ambiguities in verb semantics for evaluating visual activity recognition systems, outperforming standard exact-match methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard exact-match evaluation fails to capture ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation, leading to incomplete model assessments.

Method: A vision-language clustering framework constructs verb sense clusters to evaluate activity recognition models more robustly.

Result: Analysis shows each image maps to 2.8 sense clusters, and cluster-based evaluation aligns better with human judgements than standard methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a nuanced and human-aligned assessment of model performance, addressing limitations of traditional evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

### [8] [A Multi-Stage Large Language Model Framework for Extracting Suicide-Related Social Determinants of Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05003)
*Song Wang,Yishu Wei,Haotian Ma,Max Lovitt,Kelly Deng,Yuan Meng,Zihan Xu,Jingze Zhang,Yunyu Xiao,Ying Ding,Xuhai Xu,Joydeep Ghosh,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-stage LLM framework improves extraction of social determinants of health (SDoH) factors from unstructured text, outperforming other models and enhancing explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data-driven SDoH analysis for suicide prevention, including long-tailed factor distributions and limited model explainability.

Method: Proposed a multi-stage LLM framework, compared with BioBERT, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek-R1, and evaluated via automated tests and a user study.

Result: Framework outperformed others in SDoH extraction and context retrieval, with fine-tuning achieving comparable performance at lower cost. Improved explainability.

Conclusion: The approach enhances accuracy and transparency in SDoH extraction, aiding early risk identification and suicide prevention strategies.

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [9] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for DiaASQ by partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues using structural entropy minimization, followed by a two-step quadruple extraction framework, achieving state-of-the-art results with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume uniform sentiment distribution across dialogues, but dialogues often contain independent sub-dialogues, introducing noise.

Method: Partitions dialogues into sub-dialogues using structural entropy minimization, then extracts sentiment elements at utterance level and matches quadruples at sub-dialogue level.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses noise in dialogue sentiment extraction by focusing on semantically independent sub-dialogues, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

### [10] [Evaluation of LLMs in AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05028)
*Shu Han Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetuning decoder-only LLMs like Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 achieves comparable performance to SOTA AMR parsers, with LLaMA 3.2 notably competitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of straightforward finetuning of decoder-only LLMs for AMR parsing, comparing their performance to complex SOTA parsers.

Method: Finetuned four LLM architectures (Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, DeepSeek R1) on the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set.

Result: LLaMA 3.2 achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804, comparable to SOTA parsers, with Phi 3.5 excelling in structural validity.

Conclusion: Straightforward finetuning of decoder-only LLMs can match SOTA AMR parsers, with LLaMA 3.2 leading in semantic performance.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

### [11] [Align, Don't Divide: Revisiting the LoRA Architecture in Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05078)
*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Align-LoRA simplifies multi-task learning for LLMs by using a single high-rank adapter and alignment loss, outperforming complex multi-adapter systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges the need for structural diversity in multi-task learning (MTL) for LLMs, questioning the effectiveness of multi-adapter or multi-head systems.

Method: Proposes Align-LoRA, a single-adapter approach with increased rank and an alignment loss to align task representations in shared space.

Result: Align-LoRA outperforms complex multi-adapter and multi-head systems, demonstrating superior MTL generalization.

Conclusion: Effective MTL generalization relies on robust shared representations, not task-specific isolation, simplifying LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.

### [12] [Multimodal Fact Checking with Unified Visual, Textual, and Contextual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05097)
*Aditya Kishore,Gaurav Kumar,Jasabanta Patro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiCheck is a unified framework for multimodal fact verification, combining text and image encoders with cross-modal fusion, achieving a high F1 score of 0.84 on Factify 2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of multimodal misinformation by developing a system that leverages both textual and visual evidence for fact-checking.

Method: Proposes MultiCheck, a framework with dedicated text and image encoders, a fusion module for cross-modal interactions, and a contrastive learning objective for semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.84 on the Factify 2 dataset, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: MultiCheck demonstrates the effectiveness of explicit multimodal reasoning for scalable and interpretable fact-checking.

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [13] [BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05100)
*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEE-RAG, a framework to address performance issues in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) caused by long context lengths, using entropy invariance and balanced attention dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have knowledge limitations, and RAG, while useful, suffers from unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval contexts.

Method: Proposes BEE-RAG, which uses entropy invariance to balance context entropy, separates attention sensitivity from context length, and includes zero-shot inference and adaptive fine-tuning.

Result: BEE-RAG improves RAG performance across multiple tasks by maintaining stable entropy levels and optimizing attention dynamics.

Conclusion: BEE-RAG effectively addresses the challenges of long retrieval contexts in RAG, enhancing adaptability and performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

### [14] [Attention Basin: Why Contextual Position Matters in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05128)
*Zihao Yi,Delong Zeng,Zhenqing Ling,Haohao Luo,Zhe Xu,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Wanxia Cao,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit positional bias, focusing on sequence start/end (attention basin). AttnRank reranks inputs to align critical info with high-attention positions, improving performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate positional bias in LLMs, enhancing performance by optimizing attention allocation.

Method: Introduces AttnRank: a two-stage framework (calibration and reranking) to align salient content with high-attention positions.

Result: Substantial improvements in multi-hop QA and few-shot tasks across 10 LLMs, without model changes.

Conclusion: AttnRank effectively leverages positional attention bias for performance gains, offering a simple, model-agnostic solution.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

*Chang Hong,Minghao Wu,Qingying Xiao,Yuchi Wang,Xiang Wan,Guangjun Yu,Benyou Wang,Yan Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrinciplismQA is a benchmark with 3,648 questions to evaluate LLMs' alignment with medical ethics, revealing gaps in practical application and highlighting the need for better ethical alignment in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks overlook ethical reasoning in LLMs, necessitating a rigorous evaluation for healthcare integration.

Method: PrinciplismQA uses a high-quality dataset of multiple-choice and open-ended questions from authoritative sources, validated by experts.

Result: LLMs show a gap in ethical knowledge vs. practical application, struggle with Beneficence, and domain fine-tuning improves ethical competence.

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA provides a scalable framework to diagnose ethical weaknesses, promoting balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

TL;DR: The paper details the ATLANTIS team's methods for detecting hallucinated text in QA systems, achieving top results in Spanish and competitive rankings in English and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or misleading content (hallucinations), which needs detection and mitigation.

Method: Explored few-shot prompting with LLMs, token-level classification, and fine-tuning on synthetic data, with and without external context.

Result: Achieved top rankings in Spanish and competitive placements in English and German.

Conclusion: Integrating context is crucial to reduce hallucinations; fine-tuned models and prompt engineering show promise.

Abstract: This paper presents the contributions of the ATLANTIS team to SemEval-2025
Task 3, focusing on detecting hallucinated text spans in question answering
systems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural
Language Generation (NLG) but remain susceptible to hallucinations, generating
incorrect or misleading content. To address this, we explored methods both with
and without external context, utilizing few-shot prompting with a LLM,
token-level classification or LLM fine-tuned on synthetic data. Notably, our
approaches achieved top rankings in Spanish and competitive placements in
English and German. This work highlights the importance of integrating relevant
context to mitigate hallucinations and demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
models and prompt engineering.

*Haonan Shangguan,Xiaocui Yang,Shi Feng,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang,Ge Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MulCoT-RD, a lightweight model for joint multimodal sentiment reasoning and classification (JMSRC), addressing resource constraints by distilling knowledge from a large multimodal LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MSA approaches rely on heavy LLMs, ignoring resource-limited environments. The paper aims to enable autonomous sentiment reasoning and classification in such settings.

Method: Proposes MulCoT-RD, a "Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation model. It uses a large MLLM to generate reasoning data, trains a medium assistant, and a lightweight student for efficient JMSRC.

Result: MulCoT-RD with 3B parameters performs strongly on JMSRC across four datasets, showing robust generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses resource constraints in MSA, offering efficient and interpretable sentiment analysis.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

### [18] [Pruning Large Language Models by Identifying and Preserving Functional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05239)
*Yiheng Liu,Junhao Ning,Sichen Xia,Xiaohui Gao,Ning Qiang,Bao Ge,Junwei Han,Xintao Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured pruning method for LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks, inspired by neural networks in the human brain, to improve pruning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods disrupt LLM functionalities by ignoring neuron interactions. The study aims to preserve these interactions for better performance.

Method: Treats LLMs as digital brains, decomposes them into functional networks, and prunes by preserving key neurons within these networks.

Result: Successfully identifies functional networks and key neurons, enabling efficient pruning.

Conclusion: The method improves pruning performance by maintaining functional architecture, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

### [19] [CodeBoost: Boosting Code LLMs by Squeezing Knowledge from Code Snippets with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05242)
*Sijie Wang,Quanjiang Guo,Kai Zhao,Yawei Zhang,Xin Li,Xiang Li,Siqi Li,Rui She,Shangshu Yu,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeBoost is a post-training framework for code LLMs that enhances performance using code snippets without human-annotated instructions, addressing scalability issues in instruction-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in collecting high-quality coding instructions manually and the abundance of code snippets motivate the need for a scalable alternative to instruction-based post-training.

Method: CodeBoost introduces maximum-clique curation, bi-directional prediction, error-aware prediction, heterogeneous augmentation, and heterogeneous rewarding to train code LLMs purely from code snippets.

Result: Experiments show CodeBoost consistently improves performance across various code LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CodeBoost is an effective and scalable training pipeline for enhancing code LLMs without relying on human-annotated instructions.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

### [20] [ASCoT: An Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought Method for Late-Stage Fragility in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05282)
*Dongxu Zhang,Ning Yang,Jihua Zhu,Jinnan Yang,Miao Xin,Baoliang Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the 'cascading failure' hypothesis in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, revealing 'Late-Stage Fragility'—errors in later stages harm outcomes more. It introduces ASCoT, an adaptive correction method, improving accuracy over standard CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of reasoning chains in LLMs, particularly the overlooked vulnerability of late-stage errors.

Method: Introduces ASCoT with an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) and Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE), prioritizing late-stage corrections.

Result: ASCoT outperforms baselines like standard CoT on benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH), demonstrating higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction in LLM reasoning, moving beyond uniform verification.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

*Sukannya Purkayastha,Nils Dycke,Anne Lauscher,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using dialogue agents to assist meta-reviewers, leveraging synthetic data from LLMs and demonstrating improved efficiency in meta-reviewing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-reviewing is a decision-making process requiring argument weighing, but prior work treated it as summarization. Dialogue agents can assist decision-makers, but data scarcity is a challenge.

Method: Generate synthetic data using LLMs with self-refinement, train dialogue agents on this data, and evaluate in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios.

Result: The method produces high-quality synthetic data and outperforms off-the-shelf LLM-based assistants, enhancing meta-reviewing efficiency.

Conclusion: Dialogue agents trained on synthetic LLM-generated data effectively assist meta-reviewers, improving the meta-reviewing process.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SONAR-LLM is a decoder-only transformer that combines continuous SONAR embeddings with token-level cross-entropy, achieving competitive text generation quality without diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To retain the semantic abstraction of Large Concept Models (LCM) while eliminating the need for diffusion sampling and restoring a likelihood-based training signal.

Method: Uses a hybrid objective: continuous SONAR embeddings supervised by token-level cross-entropy via a frozen SONAR decoder.

Result: Achieves competitive generation quality across model sizes (39M to 1.3B parameters).

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM offers a scalable and reproducible approach to text generation, with released training code and checkpoints for future research.

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

### [23] [Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05337)
*Jiameng Huang,Baijiong Lin,Guhao Feng,Jierun Chen,Di He,Lu Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGRS reduces overthinking in LRLMs by suppressing reflection triggers when confidence is high, cutting token usage by 18.5%-41.9% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overthinking in LRLMs leads to redundant reasoning steps, increasing costs and reducing utility.

Method: CGRS dynamically suppresses reflection triggers during high-confidence responses, avoiding redundant cycles.

Result: Reduces token usage significantly (18.5%-41.9%) while maintaining accuracy across benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: CGRS offers a practical, model-agnostic solution for efficient reasoning in LRLMs.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

*Fenya Wasserroth,Eleftherios Avramidis,Vera Czehmann,Tanja Kojic,Fabrizio Nunnari,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of adjustable features in a sign language avatar on Hololens 2, finding no significant UX or comprehensibility improvements despite user preference for adjustability. Key issues included missing SL elements and poor implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how adjustable features in a sign language avatar affect comprehensibility, UX, and acceptability among expert users.

Method: Analysis of interactions with adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a specific use case, focusing on UX, comprehensibility, and acceptability.

Result: No significant UX or comprehensibility improvements; adjustable avatar caused higher stress. Hedonic quality rated higher than pragmatic quality.

Conclusion: Personalisation alone is insufficient; SL avatars must be comprehensible by default. Recommendations include improving animation, interaction interfaces, and using participatory design.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

TL;DR: The paper explores LLM self-feedback in domain-specific professional search, like biomedical research, using models like Gemini-Flash 2.0 and DeepSeek-R1, with varied results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of autonomous search systems in professional domains, ensuring alignment with expert needs and transparency.

Method: Used self-feedback mechanism for LLMs to iteratively refine outputs, tested on BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge questions.

Result: Preliminary results show mixed performance of self-feedback across models and tasks.

Conclusion: Insights into LLM self-correction can guide future comparisons with human expert feedback in search systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

TL;DR: MyCulture is a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on Malaysian culture, addressing biases in high-resource language dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate cultural and linguistic biases in LLMs, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu.

Method: Introduces MyCulture with an open-ended multiple-choice format across six cultural pillars, analyzing structural and language biases.

Result: Reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension among LLMs, emphasizing the need for inclusive benchmarks.

Conclusion: Culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks are crucial for fair LLM development and assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Result: A 20-month study of 50 models revealed performance ceilings on memorization and contamination vulnerabilities, with robust ranking stability.

Conclusion: LLMEval-3 provides a credible, dynamic evaluation paradigm for assessing true LLM capabilities, promoting trustworthy standards.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with fine-grained, token-level understanding and structural reasoning, which are crucial for precision-demanding applications.

Method: TASE includes 10 tasks (e.g., character counting, syntactic parsing) across Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set and synthetic data generation. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated, and a custom Qwen2.5-14B model was trained using GRPO.

Result: Human performance significantly outperforms current LLMs, highlighting weaknesses in token-level reasoning.

Conclusion: TASE identifies LLM limitations and provides a diagnostic tool for improving low-level language understanding and cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: To systematically compare and analyze existing creativity metrics to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Method: Examination and comparison of creativity measures (creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, LLM-as-a-Judge) across creative domains like writing, problem-solving, and ideation.

Result: Metrics show limited consistency, each capturing different aspects of creativity, with notable limitations (e.g., bias in LLM-as-a-Judge).

Conclusion: There's a need for more robust and generalizable evaluation frameworks that align better with human judgments of creativity.

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks and hallucinations. RAG helps but lacks structured reasoning. LAG aims to enhance reasoning by integrating logical decomposition and dependency-aware steps.

Method: LAG decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions, resolves them sequentially with dependency-aware reasoning, and uses a logical termination mechanism to halt unanswerable queries.

Result: LAG outperforms RAG on four benchmarks, improving reasoning robustness, reducing hallucinations, and aligning with human cognition.

Conclusion: LAG offers a principled, logic-driven alternative to RAG, enhancing LLM performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

*Harsh Nishant Lalai,Raj Sanjay Shah,Jiaxin Pei,Sashank Varma,Yi-Chia Wang,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates implicit biases in LLMs using the 20 Questions game, revealing geographic disparities in entity deduction, favoring the Global North and West.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover subtle implicit biases in LLMs that persist despite mitigation efforts, using a proactive questioning approach.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs in the 20 Questions game across gameplay configurations and languages, using the Geo20Q+ dataset.

Result: LLMs show significant geographic disparities, performing better for Global North/West entities, with minimal language impact. Pre-training data frequency and Wikipedia pageviews don't fully explain disparities.

Conclusion: Creative evaluation frameworks like 20 Questions reveal hidden biases in LLMs, highlighting geographic and cultural disparities in reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoLex improves legal text generation by dynamically copying from context based on model confidence, ensuring faithfulness and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in legal domains face issues with unfaithful or hallucinatory outputs, and current retrieval-augmented methods lack guaranteed context integration.

Method: CoCoLex combines model-generated vocabulary with context-derived copying, guided by confidence to enforce faithfulness.

Result: CoCoLex outperforms existing methods on five legal benchmarks, especially in long-form tasks.

Conclusion: CoCoLex effectively enhances legal text generation by ensuring context fidelity through confidence-guided copying.

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

*Guang Yang,Xinyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A frequency-based uncertainty quantification method for LLMs in MCQA, using conformal prediction to ensure reliable coverage, outperforming logit-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unreliability of LLMs (e.g., hallucination, overconfidence) in high-risk MCQA applications by providing provable uncertainty guarantees.

Method: Proposes a frequency-based approach using multiple independent samplings of model outputs, calculating predictive entropy (PE) from the most frequent sample. Conformal prediction ensures coverage guarantees.

Result: Frequency-based PE outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing correct/incorrect predictions (AUROC). Controls miscoverage rates effectively under user-specified risks.

Conclusion: Sampling frequency is a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in black-box settings, offering a model-agnostic framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

*Franziska Weeber,Tanise Ceron,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether political opinions in multilingual large language models (MLLMs) vary across languages or transfer uniformly. Findings show minimal cross-lingual differences in unaligned models and uniform opinion shifts post-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if political opinions in MLLMs reflect cross-cultural differences or transfer uniformly across languages.

Method: Analyzed MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages by prompting them with political statements from voting advice applications. Evaluated models before and after alignment using direct preference optimization.

Result: Unaligned models showed few significant cross-lingual differences. Political alignment shifted opinions uniformly across languages.

Conclusion: Political opinions transfer between languages in Western contexts, highlighting challenges in achieving socio-linguistic and political alignment in MLLMs.

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith is a framework for synthesizing high-difficulty math problems to improve LLM reasoning, outperforming baselines in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of high-quality, challenging training data for LLMs in mathematical reasoning.

Method: Constructs new problems from scratch using PlanetMath, employs reinforcement learning for optimization, and uses reasoning trace length to reflect complexity.

Result: Outperforms baselines in benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench) under short and long CoT settings.

Conclusion: MathSmith demonstrates scalability and effectiveness in advancing LLM reasoning through synthetic high-difficulty data.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Haitao Hong,Yuchen Yan,Xingyu Wu,Guiyang Hou,Wenqi Zhang,Weiming Lu,Yongliang Shen,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cooper, a RL framework that jointly optimizes policy and reward models to address limitations of rule-based and model-based rewards, enhancing robustness and mitigating reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward paradigms (rule-based and model-based) for LLMs in reasoning tasks have limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, and model-based rewards are prone to reward hacking.

Method: Proposes Cooper, which co-optimizes policy and reward models, leveraging rule-based rewards for precision and dynamically training the reward model with positive-negative sample pairs. Introduces a hybrid annotation strategy and reference-based reward modeling (VerifyRM).

Result: Cooper improves robustness, mitigates reward hacking, and enhances RL performance (e.g., 0.54% accuracy gain on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct). VerifyRM outperforms same-size models on VerifyBench.

Conclusion: Dynamically updating reward models effectively combats reward hacking, offering a better integration of reward models into RL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniEAR evaluates language models' embodied reasoning, revealing challenges in dynamic tool usage and multi-agent coordination, with performance drops in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexplored capacity of language models for embodied reasoning, focusing on physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination.

Method: OmniEAR uses text-based environment representation to model continuous physical properties and spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios in household and industrial domains.

Result: Performance drops significantly for tool reasoning (56-85%) and implicit collaboration (63-85%), with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks but not multi-agent ones.

Conclusion: Embodied reasoning poses unique challenges beyond current models' capabilities, establishing OmniEAR as a benchmark for advancing embodied AI.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination issues in Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) by proposing a novel reward function for online RL, improving factuality, detail, and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: R-LLMs struggle with factuality and hallucinations in long-form tasks, and existing RL methods face challenges like reward hacking.

Method: Introduces a reward function combining factual precision, detail level, and relevance, applied via online RL.

Result: Achieves 23.1% lower hallucination rate, 23% higher detail, and maintains response helpfulness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances factual reasoning in R-LLMs without compromising quality.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probes analyze persuasion dynamics in LLMs, outperforming prompting in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs persuade humans in multi-turn conversations using insights from cognitive science.

Method: Apply linear probes to study persuasion success, persuadee personality, and strategy in natural conversations.

Result: Probes effectively capture persuasion dynamics, identifying key moments and strategies, sometimes outperforming prompting.

Conclusion: Probes offer a computationally efficient method to study complex behaviors like deception in multi-turn settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byte-level models avoid tokenizer fragility but struggle with computational inefficiency in morphologically-rich languages.

Method: H-NET++ introduces hierarchical dynamic chunking, cross-chunk attention, a latent hyper-prior, orthographic artifact handling, and curriculum training.

Result: Outperforms BPE-based GPT-2-fa with 12% better compression, 5.4pp ParsGLUE gain, 53% ZWNJ robustness, and 73.8% F1 on morphological boundaries.

Conclusion: H-NET++ offers an effective tokenizer-free solution for MRLs, aligning with morphology and maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: RetinexDual, a novel framework for Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration, outperforms traditional methods by combining scale-attentive and frequency-domain approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like downsampling or frequency-domain transformations have limitations in UHD IR, such as irreversible information loss or ineffective artifact handling.

Method: RetinexDual uses two sub-networks: SAMBA for reflectance correction and FIA for frequency-domain illumination adaptation.

Result: RetinexDual excels in deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and LLIE, surpassing recent methods in quality and metrics.

Conclusion: The framework's dual design and component effectiveness are validated, highlighting its superiority in UHD IR tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

TL;DR: ENTRep introduces a grand challenge for ENT endoscopy analysis, combining fine-grained classification with image and text retrieval under bilingual clinical supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery in ENT care is underdeveloped due to device variability, operator differences, and subtle findings. Existing benchmarks lack support for case retrieval.

Method: ENTRep integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval, using a bilingual (Vietnamese/English) dataset of expert-annotated images and descriptions.

Result: The challenge includes benchmark tasks, standardized protocols, and server-side scoring, with results from top-performing teams and insights discussed.

Conclusion: ENTRep addresses gaps in ENT endoscopy analysis, offering a comprehensive benchmark for classification and retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

TL;DR: CoMAD unifies knowledge from multiple self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network using asymmetric masking and joint consensus gating, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods are pretrained in isolation, missing complementary insights and resulting in impractical large models for resource-constrained deployment.

Method: CoMAD distills knowledge from three ViT-Base teachers (MAE, MoCo v3, iBOT) using asymmetric masking, linear adapters, layer normalization, and joint consensus gating. The student is trained with dual-level KL divergence.

Result: CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4% Top-1 on ImageNet-1K, 47.3% mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5%/40.5% box/mask AP on MS-COCO, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoMAD effectively unifies diverse self-supervised insights into a compact model, outperforming prior methods in both classification and dense-prediction tasks.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR introduces a reconstruction-free, attention-based diffusion model for real-time anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction-based diffusion models for anomaly detection are computationally expensive, prone to errors in complex patterns, and require prior knowledge of anomalies.

Method: RADAR directly generates anomaly maps from diffusion models without reconstruction, using attention mechanisms for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: RADAR improves F1 scores by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on 3D-printed material datasets compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: RADAR addresses key limitations of reconstruction-based methods, offering superior performance and practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective deep learning method using event cameras to track eye movements, achieving 81% accuracy with a CNN_LSTM model, and suggests future improvements with LRP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate eye tracking is challenging due to rapid eye movements and expensive equipment. The goal is to develop a cost-effective solution for applications in VR/AR.

Method: The study uses deep learning, specifically a CNN_LSTM model, to predict eye center positions from event camera inputs.

Result: The CNN_LSTM model achieved approximately 81% accuracy in tracking eye movements.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and cost-efficient, with future work aimed at improving interpretability and performance using LRP.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN is a 3D human motion prediction model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Lucas polynomial activations, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D human motion prediction.

Method: LuKAN encodes temporal data via discrete wavelet transform, captures inter-joint dependencies, and uses KAN with Lucas polynomials for efficient function approximation.

Result: LuKAN outperforms baselines on three datasets, offering high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LuKAN is a compact, efficient model for 3D human motion prediction, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to identify subtle visual clues and integrate them with world knowledge for complex reasoning, revealing current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on subtle local details critical for deep visual understanding and complex reasoning.

Method: Introduces VER-Bench, a framework with 374 questions across six reasoning types, each with structured visual clues and reasoning evidence.

Result: Current models struggle with extracting and reasoning from fine-grained visual evidence.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to improve MLLMs' capabilities in fine-grained visual analysis for robust understanding.

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

TL;DR: DAMM introduces multi-modal queries and dual-stream attention to improve transformer-based object detection, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based detectors struggle with occlusions, localization, and inefficiency due to fixed queries and dense attention.

Method: DAMM uses appearance, positional, and random queries with dual-stream cross-attention for semantic and spatial refinement.

Result: Achieved top performance in AP and recall on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention enhance accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of label ambiguity in hateful video detection by analyzing fine-grained, timestamped segments, revealing how coarse annotations introduce noise and affect model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of hate speech in online multimedia requires accurate detection, but current methods relying on video-level annotations overlook temporal granularity, leading to label noise.

Method: The study trims hateful videos using annotated timestamps to isolate hateful segments, analyzes their characteristics, and evaluates the impact of label noise on model performance.

Result: Coarse annotations introduce semantic overlap and confusion, altering model decision boundaries and reducing classification confidence.

Conclusion: Temporally aware models and benchmarks are needed for robust and interpretable hate speech detection in videos.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [51] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA introduces test-time adaptation for video highlight detection, improving generalization by dynamically adjusting to each test video's unique characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed models for highlight detection, failing to adapt to individual test videos' unique features, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Proposes Highlight-TTA, a framework that dynamically adapts models during testing using an auxiliary task (cross-modality hallucinations) alongside the primary task. Uses meta-auxiliary training for effective adaptation.

Result: Experiments with three models and datasets show Highlight-TTA improves performance, yielding superior highlight detection results.

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA enhances generalization and performance in video highlight detection by adapting models to test videos dynamically.

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [52] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to adapt monocular depth estimators (FMDEs) for fisheye images using calibration tokens, avoiding retraining and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs trained on perspective images fail on fisheye images due to covariate shift from camera calibration differences.

Method: Uses calibration tokens to align latent embeddings of fisheye images to perspective images, leveraging self-supervised training with recalibrated perspective images.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: The method enables FMDEs to work with fisheye cameras without retraining, using a lightweight adaptation mechanism.

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

Motivation: To improve image classification accuracy using a feedforward neural network on the ImageNet dataset.

Method: Training a feedforward neural network with a new method on ImageNet 2012, using 322M parameters with high precision.

Result: Achieved 98.3% accuracy, 99.69 Top-1 rate, and 285.9 perfect labels per batch.

Conclusion: The model performs exceptionally but is limited by potential double-labeling issues in the dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM enhances VLMs by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into prompt learning, improving generalization without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods like CoOp and CoCoOp overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories.

Method: ProMIM uses a masking strategy on visible image patches to generate robust, instance-conditioned prompts, augmenting existing methods like CoOp and CoCoOp.

Result: ProMIM consistently improves generalization in zero-shot and few-shot tasks without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: ProMIM offers a lightweight, effective solution for enhancing vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRKT enhances WS-DSGG by improving object detection in dynamic scenes using relation-aware knowledge mining and dual-stream fusion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WS-DSGG methods rely on external object detectors, which perform poorly in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios, leading to inaccurate results.

Method: TRKT uses relation-aware knowledge mining (with attention maps and inter-frame augmentation) and a dual-stream fusion module to refine object proposals.

Result: TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Action Genome dataset.

Conclusion: TRKT effectively addresses the limitations of external detectors in WS-DSGG, improving accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvDINO is a domain-adversarial SSL framework that improves robustness to domain shift in biomedical imaging, demonstrated on lung cancer mIF data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SSL methods struggle with domain shift, especially in biomedical imaging where batch effects obscure biological signals.

Method: Integrates a gradient reversal layer into DINOv2 for domain-invariant feature learning.

Result: Mitigates slide-specific biases, uncovers phenotype clusters with prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction.

Conclusion: AdvDINO is broadly applicable to domains with domain shift and limited annotations, enhancing model generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg is a human-in-the-loop framework for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation, leveraging sparse annotations and hierarchical prototype disambiguation to achieve high-quality segmentation for base and novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation rely on resource-intensive offline learning or dense annotations, limiting practicality. HOW-Seg addresses these limitations by incorporating human feedback.

Method: HOW-Seg constructs class prototypes directly on query data to avoid bias, uses sparse human annotations for guidance, refines prototypes with hierarchical disambiguation, and optimizes labels with dense CRF. Iterative human feedback improves predictions.

Result: HOW-Seg matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods with sparse annotations (e.g., one-click-per-class) and achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2 with denser annotations.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg is a practical and effective solution for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation, outperforming alternatives by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback and advanced techniques.

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improves novel view synthesis (NVS) with adaptive Gaussian weighting and learned uncertainties, outperforming rivals in sparse-view scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods treat Gaussians equally, leading to overfitting, especially in sparse-view settings. Adaptive weighting and uncertainty learning aim to address this.

Method: Proposes learned uncertainties to guide Gaussian opacity updates and uses soft differentiable dropout regularization for Gaussian projection and blending.

Result: Outperforms existing methods (e.g., 3.27% PSNR improvement over DropGaussian on MipNeRF 360) with higher quality and fewer Gaussians.

Conclusion: Adaptive weighting and uncertainty learning enhance 3DGS, making it more robust and efficient for sparse-view NVS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of executing high-resolution object detection under strict latency constraints on limited computing resources.

Method: Extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling by allowing variable-size canvas frames and selectable frame rates, evaluated using YOLOv11 on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Improved quality/cost trade-offs, achieving higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements to canvas-based attention scheduling enable better performance for real-time perception on edge platforms.

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODEC is a single-step diffusion image compression model addressing latency and fidelity issues in diffusion-based methods, outperforming existing techniques with faster decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based image compression has high latency and poor fidelity due to multi-step sampling and reliance on generative priors.

Method: Uses a pre-trained VAE for rich latent information, replaces iterative denoising with single-step decoding, and adds a fidelity guidance module. Rate annealing training is introduced for low bitrates.

Result: SODEC achieves superior rate-distortion-perception performance and improves decoding speed by over 20x compared to prior diffusion models.

Conclusion: SODEC effectively addresses latency and fidelity issues, offering a practical and efficient solution for diffusion-based image compression.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

### [61] [Propagating Sparse Depth via Depth Foundation Model for Out-of-Distribution Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04984)
*Shenglun Chen,Xinzhu Ma,Hong Zhang,Haojie Li,Zhihui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel depth completion framework leverages depth foundation models for robustness without large-scale training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth completion models degrade in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios due to reliance on limited data. Foundation models offer robustness potential.

Method: Uses a depth foundation model for environmental cues, dual-space propagation (3D/2D), and a learnable correction module for refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 16 OOD datasets, demonstrating remarkable robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances depth completion robustness without extensive training, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

### [62] [Unified modality separation: A vision-language framework for unsupervised domain adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04987)
*Xinyao Li,Jingjing Li,Zhekai Du,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified modality separation framework to address the modality gap in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap in VLMs limits UDA by only transferring modality-invariant knowledge, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: A framework disentangles modality-specific and invariant components from VLM features, uses modality-adaptive ensemble weights, and introduces a modality discrepancy metric for sample categorization.

Result: The method achieves up to 9% performance gain and 9x computational efficiency, validated across various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the modality gap, enhancing UDA performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

### [63] [Modeling Rapid Contextual Learning in the Visual Cortex with Fast-Weight Deep Autoencoder Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04988)
*Yue Li,Weifan Wang,Tai Sing Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how familiarity training in a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder induces global context sensitivity in early layers, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fast weights. Results show manifold transformation, alignment of latent representations, broadened self-attention scope, and amplified effects with LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how rapid learning of global image context in early visual cortex can be modeled in deep neural networks, focusing on fast weights and recurrent interactions.

Method: A ViT-based autoencoder with LoRA for fast weights is used to simulate familiarity training, analyzing self-attention circuits and latent representations.

Result: Familiarity training aligns early-layer representations with global context, broadens self-attention scope, and enhances effects with LoRA.

Conclusion: Familiarity training introduces global sensitivity in hierarchical networks, and hybrid fast-slow weight architectures may model rapid context learning in the brain.

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

### [64] [Attribute Guidance With Inherent Pseudo-label For Occluded Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04998)
*Rui Zhi,Zhen Yang,Haiyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-ReID is a novel framework for occluded person re-identification that leverages pre-trained models to extract fine-grained attributes without extra data, improving performance in occluded and subtle attribute scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained vision-language models struggle with occluded Re-ID due to their focus on holistic semantics, neglecting fine-grained attributes. AG-ReID addresses this gap.

Method: AG-ReID uses a two-stage process: generating attribute pseudo-labels and a dual-guidance mechanism combining holistic and fine-grained features.

Result: AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on Re-ID datasets, excelling in occluded and subtle attribute scenarios while maintaining standard performance.

Conclusion: AG-ReID effectively bridges the gap in occluded Re-ID by leveraging fine-grained attributes, demonstrating superior performance without additional annotations.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CRAM, a method for video continual learning using compressed vision and rehearsal-based training, reducing memory footprint while outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high memory requirements of video continual learning, especially for long videos, to enable practical deployment.

Method: Uses compressed video codes (embeddings) instead of raw inputs, with a rehearsal buffer. Introduces a scheme to refresh video codes to combat catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on large-scale benchmarks (EpicKitchens-100, Kinetics-700) with significantly reduced memory usage (under 2 GB).

Conclusion: CRAM effectively reduces memory requirements for video continual learning while maintaining performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

*Xusheng Liang,Lihua Zhou,Nianxin Li,Miao Xu,Ziyang Song,Dong Yi,Jinlin Wu,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDRL integrates causal inference with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve domain generalization in medical image segmentation by addressing confounders like equipment differences and imaging modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images have high variability and domain shifts, causing poor generalization in VLMs like CLIP.

Method: MCDRL uses CLIP to identify lesion regions and build a confounder dictionary, then trains a causal intervention network to eliminate domain-specific variations.

Result: MCDRL outperforms other methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robust generalization.

Conclusion: MCDRL effectively addresses domain shifts in medical imaging, enhancing VLM performance for segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset for assessing perceptual quality of AI-enhanced UGC, evaluates existing models, and analyzes their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized quality assessment models for AI-enhanced UGC limits user experience and hinders advancement in enhancement methods.

Method: Constructed AU-IQA dataset (4,800 images) with three enhancement types (super-resolution, low-light, denoising) and evaluated traditional IQA and multimodal models.

Result: Comprehensive analysis of current models' performance on AI-UGC quality assessment.

Conclusion: AU-IQA fills a critical gap, enabling better evaluation and advancement of AI-based image enhancement techniques.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised multimodal framework, skin-SOAP, generates structured SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing manual effort and achieving performance comparable to advanced models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin carcinoma is highly prevalent and costly, requiring efficient documentation. Manual SOAP note generation is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.

Method: Proposes skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework using lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate SOAP notes with minimal manual annotations.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro, validated by novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS).

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, clinically grounded documentation, reducing clinician burden and the need for large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCSSIM, a novel metric for evaluating image quality in generative AI by focusing on Scene Composition Structure (SCS) integrity, outperforming traditional and neural-network-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image quality metrics fail to adequately assess the structural fidelity of generative AI outputs, particularly in preserving Scene Composition Structure (SCS).

Method: The authors propose SCSSIM, a training-free metric using statistical measures from Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning to quantify SCS preservation.

Result: SCSSIM shows high invariance to non-compositional distortions and strong sensitivity to compositional distortions, outperforming existing metrics.

Conclusion: SCSSIM is a superior tool for evaluating generative models, ensuring scene composition integrity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAMoBE, a novel framework for video-based person re-identification (ReID), which hierarchically and adaptively combines biometric features for improved matching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based ReID methods lack focus on selecting discriminative features from query-gallery pairs, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments.

Method: HAMoBE uses a pre-trained large model (e.g., CLIP) to extract multi-layer features, modeling appearance, body shape, and gait. It includes a dual-input decision gating network to dynamically adjust expert contributions.

Result: HAMoBE achieves a +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy improvement on benchmarks like MEVID.

Conclusion: The proposed HAMoBE framework effectively addresses feature selection and integration challenges in video-based ReID, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack thorough evaluation and capability in locating fine-grained details in complex documents, such as nutritional info or disclaimers.

Method: Proposes Spot-IT, combining intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention to mimic human zoom-and-focus behavior.

Result: Spot-IT outperforms baselines, especially in precise detail extraction from complex layouts.

Conclusion: The work highlights MLLMs' limitations in fine-grained tasks and demonstrates Spot-IT's effectiveness in improving such capabilities.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating PBR materials from single images under complex lighting conditions, leveraging dual latent spaces for better accuracy.

Method: Uses two latent spaces (albedo-optimized and material-specialized) with feature distillation and rectified flow for efficiency. Extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs.

Result: Achieves up to 28% better albedo estimation and 39% reduction in metallic-roughness errors, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: DualMat offers a robust solution for PBR material estimation, enhancing image-to-3D pipelines with superior performance.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS is a two-stage framework for Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) that decouples class-aware detection from class-agnostic segmentation, improving retention-plasticity balance and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in CSS by reducing interference between old and new class learning, which is a limitation of single-stage encoder-decoder architectures.

Method: Uses a two-stage approach: (1) class-aware detection with pre-trained encoders and LoRA adaptation, and (2) class-agnostic segmentation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Result: Achieves improved retention-plasticity balance and state-of-the-art performance in CSS tasks.

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in CSS by decoupling detection and segmentation, enabling better continual learning.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automatic image colorization using classification and adversarial learning, addressing the ill-posed nature of the task by leveraging scene semantics and texture cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image colorization is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, but scene semantics and texture provide valuable color cues. The goal is to improve upon regression-based approaches by using classification and adversarial learning.

Method: The approach involves building models based on prior works, modifying them for specific scenarios, and comparing results. Classification and adversarial learning are used to address the multi-modal nature of color prediction.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the method aims to improve colorization by leveraging classification and adversarial learning.

Conclusion: The proposed method of using classification and adversarial learning offers a promising direction for improving automatic image colorization.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

TL;DR: FLUX-Makeup is a novel makeup transfer framework that eliminates auxiliary face-control components, leveraging source-reference pairs and a lightweight injector for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN and diffusion-based methods rely on extra components, introducing errors and suboptimal results. FLUX-Makeup aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Built on FLUX-Kontext, it uses source images as conditional input and introduces RefLoRAInjector for efficient makeup feature extraction. A robust data generation pipeline enhances training supervision.

Result: FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong robustness across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework provides high-fidelity, identity-consistent makeup transfer without auxiliary components, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

*Yuxiang Xiao,Yang Hu,Bin Li,Tianyang Zhang,Zexi Li,Huazhu Fu,Jens Rittscher,Kaixiang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaFusion is a prompt-guided framework that dynamically integrates multiple pathology foundation models (PFMs) to improve performance and interpretability in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs have latent biases from diverse pretraining contexts, limiting generalisability and transparency in applications.

Method: AdaFusion compresses and aligns tile-level features from multiple PFMs, using a lightweight attention mechanism to fuse them adaptively based on tissue phenotype context.

Result: AdaFusion outperforms individual PFMs on benchmarks for treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference.

Conclusion: AdaFusion effectively bridges heterogeneous PFMs, enhancing both performance and interpretability of model-specific biases.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

*Jingxuan He,Busheng Su,Finn Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGen is a novel framework for generating long, identity-preserving videos from a single image and pose sequence, using in-context LoRA finetuning and interleaved segment generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with identity drift and short clip limitations, making long, controlled video generation challenging.

Method: PoseGen uses in-context LoRA finetuning for identity preservation and pose conditioning, along with interleaved segment generation for unlimited duration.

Result: PoseGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and produces artifact-free, unlimited-length videos.

Conclusion: PoseGen addresses key challenges in video generation, offering high-quality, long, and controlled outputs with minimal training data.

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

*Liang Bai,Hong Song,Jinfu Li,Yucong Lin,Jingfan Fan,Tianyu Fu,Danni Ai,Deqiang Xiao,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty) is a novel FSCIL method that integrates margin penalties to balance base-class discriminability and new-class generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data privacy constraints and high acquisition costs in incremental tasks, which degrade performance in class-incremental learning.

Method: Proposes SMP with Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) for base task learning and Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) for incremental tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200, balancing base and new classes.

Conclusion: SMP effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by strategically integrating margin penalties, improving forward compatibility and decision boundaries.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

*Jiuyang Dong,Jiahan Li,Junjun Jiang,Kui Jiang,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AHDMIL is a framework for fast and accurate pathological image classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs in multi-instance learning (MIL) for pathological image classification due to processing thousands of patches per gigapixel whole slide image (WSI).

Method: Proposes AHDMIL with Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN) and Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), using self-distillation and asymmetric distillation to identify relevant patches. Introduces a Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier.

Result: Achieves 5.3% accuracy improvement and 1.2x faster inference on Camelyon16, with consistent gains in AUC, accuracy, F1 score, and Brier score across datasets.

Conclusion: AHDMIL is effective for reducing inference costs while improving classification performance in computational pathology.

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

*Seonghoon Yu,Joonbeom Hong,Joonseok Lee,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual grounding framework enhances object localization by generating multiple latent expressions from a single textual input, incorporating complementary visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on sparse textual cues, leading to misidentification due to the mismatch with rich visual details.

Method: Introduces subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts, and a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC approaches and excels in GRES benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between textual and visual domains, improving accuracy in visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedGIN is a Federated Learning framework for multimodal organ segmentation, addressing data scarcity and privacy issues with a GIN augmentation module, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model for accurate medical image segmentation across diverse modalities without sharing raw patient data, overcoming challenges like domain shift and data scarcity.

Method: Proposes FedGIN, integrating a GIN augmentation module to harmonize modality-specific intensity distributions in Federated Learning, evaluated on imputed and complete datasets.

Result: FedGIN improved 3D Dice scores by 12-18% in limited-data scenarios and achieved near-centralized performance in complete datasets, with 30% and 10% improvements over MRI-only and CT-only baselines.

Conclusion: FedGIN effectively generalizes across modalities under privacy constraints, offering a robust solution for multimodal medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

*Yu-Hsi Chen,Wei-Hsin Chen,Chien-Yao Wang,Hong-Yuan Mark Liao,James C. Liao,Chien-Chang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for automatically discovering chronic pain-related features in mice, outperforming human experts and existing methods in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing chronic pain in mice rely on manual labeling, which is biased and lacks accuracy in capturing persistent behavioral changes.

Method: Uses a universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse action features from video, avoiding human labeling bias.

Result: Achieves 48.41% accuracy in 15-class pain classification (vs. 21.33% for humans, 30.52% for B-SOiD) and 73.1% in 3-class classification (vs. 48% for humans, 58.43% for B-SOiD). Also reveals drug efficacy differences.

Conclusion: The method shows clinical potential for pain research and drug development by providing unbiased, automated insights.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

### [83] [Rotation Equivariant Arbitrary-scale Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05160)
*Qi Xie,Jiahong Fu,Zongben Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a rotation-equivariant arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR) method to address artifacts in high-resolution recoveries by redesigning encoder and INR modules for intrinsic rotation equivariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common geometric patterns in low-resolution images are often warped, leading to artifacts in high-resolution recoveries. Rotation equivariance can preserve original orientations and structural integrity.

Method: Redesigns encoder and INR modules to embed intrinsic rotation equivariance, enabling end-to-end rotational equivariance. Theoretical analysis evaluates equivariance error.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real datasets validate the method's superiority and its plug-and-play compatibility with existing ASISR methods.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation-equivariant ASISR method effectively maintains structural integrity and outperforms conventional approaches.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-MoGen is a unified framework for cross-species text-driven motion generation, addressing morphological differences between humans and animals with a two-stage architecture and a large-scale dataset, UniMo4D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human and animal motion separately, lacking a unified approach. Morphological differences across species challenge motion plausibility.

Method: X-MoGen uses a two-stage architecture: a conditional graph variational autoencoder for T-pose priors and an autoencoder for motion encoding, regularized by morphological loss. Masked motion modeling generates motion embeddings from text.

Result: X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seen and unseen species, validated on the UniMo4D dataset.

Conclusion: X-MoGen provides a scalable and effective solution for cross-species motion generation, with potential applications in animation and robotics.

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

TL;DR: PhysPatch is a novel adversarial patch framework for MLLM-based autonomous driving systems, optimizing patch location, shape, and content to improve attack effectiveness and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, but existing methods are ineffective due to MLLMs' complex architectures.

Method: PhysPatch uses semantic-based mask initialization, SVD-based local alignment loss, and potential field-based mask refinement.

Result: PhysPatch outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems and ensures physically feasible patch placement.

Conclusion: PhysPatch is a robust and practical solution for adversarial attacks on MLLM-based AD systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

*Zewei Wu,Longhao Wang,Cui Wang,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT), a tracklet-enhanced tracker for multitarget tracking, addressing challenges like low-confidence detections and occlusions by integrating adaptive tracklet generation and multi-clue association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multitarget tracking methods struggle with unseen categories due to low-confidence detections, weak constraints, and occlusions.

Method: MTT adaptively clusters detections into tracklets using spatio-temporal correlation, then associates tracklets using location and appearance clues to reduce long-term errors.

Result: Extensive experiments show MTT's competitiveness on generic multiple object tracking benchmarks.

Conclusion: MTT effectively addresses tracking challenges for unseen categories, demonstrating robust performance.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPA++ is a graph spectral alignment framework for domain adaptation, improving inter- and intra-domain alignment and discriminability through spectral regularization and neighbor-aware propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tradeoff between inter-domain transferability and intra-domain discriminability in domain adaptation, which prior works often overlook.

Method: Proposes SPA++ with (1) coarse graph alignment and spectral regularization, (2) fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation, and (3) data augmentation and consistency regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, showing robustness and adaptability in various scenarios.

Conclusion: SPA++ effectively balances transferability and discriminability, supported by theoretical analysis and strong empirical results.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

TL;DR: SPEX is a multimodal LLM for land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by leveraging spectral priors and textual attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral information is underutilized in vision-language models for remote sensing, leading to suboptimal performance in multispectral scenarios.

Method: SPEX uses a dataset (SPIE) encoding spectral priors into textual attributes, with multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training.

Result: SPEX outperforms existing methods on five public datasets and generates interpretable textual explanations.

Conclusion: SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model for spectral remote sensing, offering precise, flexible, and interpretable land cover extraction.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

Motivation: Dense feature matching in endoscopic images is essential for robot-assisted tasks but is hindered by difficult visual conditions and lack of annotated data.

Method: EndoMatcher uses a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks and is trained on Endo-Mix6, a multi-domain dataset of 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs. A progressive multi-objective training strategy addresses dataset challenges.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher achieves accurate, dense matching in challenging endoscopic conditions, generalizing to unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

### [90] [VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information Flow-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05211)
*Sihan Yang,Runsen Xu,Chenhang Cui,Tai Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFlowOpt is a token pruning framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that reduces computational costs by pruning 90% of visual tokens while maintaining performance, cutting KV-Cache memory by 89% and speeding up inference by 3.8x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token pruning methods in LMMs are simplistic, causing performance degradation. VFlowOpt aims to address this by optimizing pruning strategies.

Method: VFlowOpt derives importance maps from attention scores and patch-level entropy, progressively prunes tokens with a recycling mechanism, and optimizes pruning hyperparameters using visual information flow.

Result: The framework prunes 90% of visual tokens with minimal performance loss, reducing KV-Cache memory by 89% and accelerating inference by 3.8 times.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt offers an efficient and effective token pruning solution for LMMs, balancing computational savings and performance retention.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### [91] [Textual and Visual Guided Task Adaptation for Source-Free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05213)
*Jianming Liu,Wenlong Qiu,Haitao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A source-free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) method is proposed, leveraging textual and visual information for target domain adaptation without source data, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in Few-Shot Segmentation due to domain discrepancies and privacy/data transfer concerns.

Method: Uses Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) and alignment modules (VVEA and TVEA) to adapt features and align embeddings.

Result: Improves segmentation accuracy by 2.18% (1-shot) and 4.11% (5-shot) across four datasets.

Conclusion: The method outperforms state-of-the-art CD-FSS approaches, demonstrating effective cross-domain adaptation without source data.

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReasoningTrack, a reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework using Qwen2.5-VL, optimized with SFT and GRPO, and validated on a new dataset TNLLT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing vision-language tracking methods by leveraging reasoning and large models for better performance and interpretability.

Method: Proposes ReasoningTrack, embedding updated language descriptions with vision features in a unified backbone, optimized via SFT and GRPO.

Result: Validated on TNLLT dataset; outperforms 20 baseline trackers, showing effectiveness of reasoning-based natural language generation.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack advances vision-language tracking by integrating reasoning and large models, supported by a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM v2.1) segments irregular gas bubbles in multiphase flows using minimal annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional and learning-based methods fail for deformed, coalesced, or broken bubbles, especially in air lubrication systems.

Method: Transfer learning with SAM v2.1, fine-tuned on 100 annotated images.

Result: Accurate segmentation of non-convex, irregular bubble structures.

Conclusion: SAM v2.1 effectively addresses the challenge of segmenting complex bubble shapes in industrial applications.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen is a diffusion-based framework for generating controllable camera images from arbitrary viewpoints, using FAVS and CVC-SSL to address the lack of ground-truth data for unseen views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating high-fidelity images for arbitrary viewpoints in autonomous driving due to missing ground-truth data for extrapolated views.

Method: Uses Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) for hierarchical matching and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL) for enforcing consistency without ground-truth.

Result: Arbiviewgen generates controllable arbitrary-view camera images without needing additional sensors or depth maps.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen is the first method for controllable arbitrary-view image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing adversarial robustness with zero-shot generalization in VLMs, exploring diverse defense strategies.

Method: Analysis of two defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT) and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, tracking methodological evolution from alignment-preserving to embedding-space re-engineering and latent-space purification.

Result: Identified key defense methods (TeCoA, LAAT, TIMA, AOM, TTC, CLIPure) and their evolution, highlighting trade-offs and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Future directions include hybrid defense strategies and adversarial pre-training to further enhance robustness without compromising generalization.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial

TL;DR: RegionMed-CLIP is a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework for medical image understanding, addressing data scarcity and global feature limitations by integrating localized pathological signals and holistic semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of limited annotated medical data and reliance on global image features, which miss subtle pathological regions, motivate the development of RegionMed-CLIP.

Method: The framework uses an ROI processor to integrate fine-grained regional features with global context, supported by progressive training and a new dataset, MedRegion-500k.

Result: RegionMed-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art models in tasks like image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Region-aware contrastive pre-training is crucial, and RegionMed-CLIP serves as a strong foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

TL;DR: The paper reviews gender classification methods, focusing on facial and iris features, and highlights gaps and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification is useful in surveillance, profiling, and human-computer interaction, with soft biometrics like facial and iris features being key.

Method: The study reviews existing gender classification approaches, emphasizing facial and iris-based methods, and discusses segmentation and encoding techniques.

Result: The paper provides an analysis of current methods, identifies gaps, and suggests future improvements in gender classification.

Conclusion: The study aids researchers by summarizing existing approaches, highlighting challenges, and proposing future research directions.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

TL;DR: CF3 introduces a top-down pipeline for efficient 3D Gaussian feature fields, reducing computational costs by 95% compared to Feature-3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods rely on bottom-up optimization, increasing computational costs. CF3 aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: CF3 uses a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians, trains a per-Gaussian autoencoder, and employs adaptive sparsification to optimize and prune redundant Gaussians.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance using only 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: CF3 provides a compact and efficient 3D Gaussian feature field while preserving geometric details.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

TL;DR: A particle filtering tracker with cyclic-consistency checks is proposed for robust cardiac imaging during bypass surgery, outperforming deep learning and conventional trackers in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tracking methods struggle with heart motion and image fluctuations during coronary bypass grafting surgery, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The proposed method uses particle filtering with cyclic-consistency checks to track 117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps.

Result: Achieves a tracking error of 5.00 +/- 0.22 px, significantly better than deep learning (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

Conclusion: The method enables real-time, accurate cardiac perfusion estimation during interventions, improving surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following
coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative
indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points.
However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics
caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We
propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to
robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks
117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during
interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and
outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDFuse is a conditional diffusion model guided by SAM for high-fidelity infrared and visible image fusion, addressing semantic understanding and detail loss issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods lack deep semantic understanding and introduce artifacts, compromising image quality and task performance.

Method: Uses SAM-generated semantic masks as priors in a two-stage process: preliminary fusion followed by diffusion-based refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in subjective/objective evaluations and downstream task adaptability.

Conclusion: SGDFuse provides a powerful solution to core challenges in image fusion, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Motivation: 4D LiDAR is underexplored in MLLMs due to missing annotations and processing challenges, despite its potential for dynamic outdoor scene understanding.

Method: Proposes a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that directly processes raw 4D LiDAR, integrating it with language understanding.

Result: The model, dataset, and benchmark provide a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: B4DL and the proposed MLLM advance 4D LiDAR understanding, offering tools for future research in dynamic outdoor scene analysis.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and

*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WGDF leverages wavelet transforms and dual-frequency encoding to enhance change detection in remote sensing by amplifying fine-grained differences in frequency components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on spatial-domain modeling, limiting feature diversity and hindering detection of subtle changes. Frequency-domain modeling, especially in the wavelet domain, can better capture edge changes.

Method: WGDF uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose images into high- and low-frequency components. High-frequency branch employs DFFE and FDID modules for edge detail enhancement, while low-frequency branch uses Transformers and PCDM for global semantic refinement.

Result: WGDF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing edge ambiguity and improving detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: WGDF effectively unifies local sensitivity with global discriminability, offering superior performance in remote sensing change detection.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at

*Yufei Gao,Jiaying Fei,Nuo Chen,Ruirui Chen,Guohang Yan,Yunshi Lan,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-resource languages by proposing a dual-source strategy for data collection, focusing on linguistic capability and cultural groundedness. The introduced dataset, MELLA, improves MLLM performance across eight languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual enhancement methods for MLLMs lack multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource languages.

Method: A dual-source strategy is proposed: native web alt-text for cultural groundedness and MLLM-generated captions for linguistic capability. The MELLA dataset is introduced as an implementation.

Result: Fine-tuning on MELLA improves performance across eight languages, with models producing richer "thick descriptions". Gains are attributed to enhanced cultural knowledge and linguistic capability.

Conclusion: The dual-source strategy and MELLA dataset effectively enhance MLLM performance in low-resource languages by addressing both linguistic and cultural gaps.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

*Meiqi Wu,Yaxuan Kang,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu,Xiaotang Chen,Yunfeng Kang,Weiqiang Wang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated method (VS-LLM) to analyze PPAT sketches for depression assessment, improving accuracy by 17.6% over traditional psychologist evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual interpretation of PPAT sketches in art therapy is labor-intensive and subjective, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: The VS-LLM method combines visual-semantic analysis with LLM for automated depression assessment from PPAT sketches, addressing challenges like low drawing accuracy.

Result: The method outperforms psychologist assessments by 17.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work advances automated mental state assessment using PPAT sketches, with datasets and code made publicly available.

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

*Xuyang Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCAViT addresses the generalization gap in smaller models by introducing Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) for robust feature modeling, achieving strong performance on OOD benchmarks with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller models show disproportionate performance drops on OOD data, highlighting a need for better generalization in efficient architectures.

Method: Identifies architectural bottlenecks and introduces CoCA, a dynamic, domain-aware global token mechanism for enhanced feature modeling.

Result: CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with notable gains on OOD benchmarks, 52.2 mAP on COCO, and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K.

Conclusion: CoCAViT is a robust, efficient visual backbone with strong generalization and real-time performance.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

*Xu Yuan,Liangbo Ning,Wenqi Fan,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes mKG-RAG, a multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework, to enhance VQA tasks by integrating structured multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based methods, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RAG-based VQA methods often introduce irrelevant content due to unstructured documents and ignored structural relationships, reducing answer quality.

Method: The approach uses MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to build multimodal KGs, along with a dual-stage retrieval strategy for efficient and precise knowledge retrieval.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in knowledge-based VQA.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG effectively addresses limitations of vanilla RAG by leveraging structured multimodal KGs, enhancing VQA accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Textual Inversion (TI) for open-vocabulary object detection in VLMs, enabling few-shot learning without losing zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of zero-shot and natural language querying capabilities in VLMs during fine-tuning for specific targets.

Method: Extends VLM vocabulary by learning new tokens from minimal examples (as few as three), keeping original weights frozen.

Result: Retains original model performance, enables zero-shot transfer, and requires less compute than full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TI outperforms baselines prone to forgetting, offering efficient and compatible few-shot learning for VLMs.

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

*Junyu Zhou,Yuyang Huang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Ziyang Zheng,Nuowen Kan,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DGabSplat improves 3DGS by using 3D Gabor-based primitives for better high-frequency detail capture, efficiency, and memory usage, achieving superior rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with high-frequency details, redundant primitives, and inefficiency. 3DGabSplat addresses these issues with a novel primitive and optimization.

Method: Proposes 3D Gabor-based primitives with multi-directional frequency responses, a CUDA-based rasterizer, and frequency-adaptive optimization.

Result: Outperforms 3DGS, achieving up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain with fewer primitives and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat enhances 3DGS, offering better quality and efficiency, and is adaptable to existing frameworks.

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

*Luozheng Qin,Jia Gong,Yuqing Sun,Tianjiao Li,Mengping Yang,Xiaomeng Yang,Chao Qu,Zhiyu Tan,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-CoT is a unified framework for multimodal reasoning, combining macro and micro-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance vision-language tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending CoT to vision-language tasks is challenging due to fragmented architectures and limited visual state transition modeling.

Method: Uni-CoT uses a two-level reasoning paradigm (Macro-Level CoT for planning, Micro-Level CoT for execution) and structured training with interleaved supervision.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks (WISE, RISE, KRIS) with efficient training on 8 A100 GPUs.

Conclusion: Uni-CoT is a scalable, coherent solution for multimodal reasoning, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

*Kang Liu,Zhuoqi Ma,Zikang Fang,Yunan Li,Kun Xie,Qiguang Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorRG is a chest X-ray report generation framework that integrates patient-specific prior knowledge (clinical context and prior images) to improve diagnostic accuracy and report quality, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect patient-specific prior knowledge, leading to suboptimal diagnostic intent and disease progression tracking. PriorRG aims to emulate real-world clinical workflows for better report generation.

Method: PriorRG uses a two-stage approach: (1) prior-guided contrastive pre-training for spatiotemporal feature extraction, and (2) prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding to integrate prior knowledge with vision encoder outputs.

Result: PriorRG achieves a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PriorRG effectively leverages prior knowledge to enhance report generation, demonstrating significant improvements in clinical accuracy and fluency.

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

*Yong Du,Yuchen Yan,Fei Tang,Zhengxi Lu,Chang Zong,Weiming Lu,Shengpei Jiang,Yongliang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO improve GUI grounding accuracy by leveraging spatial overlap patterns and test-time reinforcement learning, achieving 2-3% and 5% boosts respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding methods rely on costly pixel-level annotations. The paper aims to exploit implicit confidence signals from spatial overlap patterns for more accurate localization without additional training.

Method: Proposes GUI-RC (Region Consistency), which constructs spatial voting grids from multiple predictions to identify consensus regions. Extends it to GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization) for test-time reinforcement learning using consistency patterns as rewards.

Result: GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% on ScreenSpot benchmarks. GUI-RCPO further enhances performance, e.g., boosting Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 85.14%.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of test-time scaling and reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a data-efficient path to robust GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

### [112] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc is a two-stage method for cross-view localization (CVL) that improves reliability by dividing query images into sub-images, validating poses, and quantifying meaningfulness to reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVL methods lack redundant observations for reliability assessment, making it hard to validate localization accuracy.

Method: Slice-Loc divides query images into sub-images, estimates 3-DoF poses for each, filters errors using geometric rigidity, and merges inliers for the final pose. It also quantifies meaningfulness via false alarm estimation.

Result: Slice-Loc reduces errors exceeding 10m to under 3%, cuts mean localization error from 4.47m to 1.86m, and orientation error from 3.42° to 1.24°, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Slice-Loc enhances CVL reliability and accuracy by introducing redundant observations and rigorous validation, proving effective in cross-city tests.

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-GRAPH is a hierarchical graph attention network for radiology report generation, improving accuracy by modeling fine-grained organ relationships and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.9% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating radiology report generation to assist radiologists by capturing fine-grained organ relationships often missed by current methods.

Method: Uses a hierarchical graph attention network (CT-GRAPH) with pretrained 3D medical feature encoders and anatomical masks to model organ relationships, integrating features into a large language model for report generation.

Result: Achieves a 7.9% absolute improvement in F1 score on the CT-RATE dataset compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH effectively models anatomical relationships for accurate radiology report generation, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GNN framework with deformable attention is proposed for pathology image analysis, improving spatial dependency modeling and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MIL and static GNNs fail to capture spatial dependencies and lack specificity in attention mechanisms for pathology images.

Method: The framework constructs a dynamic weighted directed graph with learnable spatial offsets, enabling adaptive attention to morphologically relevant regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification).

Conclusion: The deformable attention mechanism effectively captures complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs, enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

TL;DR: UNCAGE improves compositional fidelity in T2I generation using attention maps to prioritize object tokens, outperforming benchmarks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate attribute binding and text-image alignment in T2I generation, particularly for Masked Generative Transformers.

Method: Proposes UNCAGE, a training-free method leveraging attention maps to prioritize unmasking of object-representing tokens.

Result: UNCAGE enhances performance in quantitative and qualitative evaluations across benchmarks with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: UNCAGE effectively improves compositional fidelity in T2I generation, offering a practical solution without additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TrueBiometric detects and corrects backdoor-poisoned images in biometric systems with 100% accuracy using majority voting and corrective noise, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in biometric systems compromise security by manipulating training data, and current defenses struggle to identify and mitigate such attacks without reducing data utility.

Method: TrueBiometric uses majority voting with multiple vision-language models to detect poisoned images and applies targeted corrective noise to fix them.

Result: The method achieves 100% accuracy in detecting and correcting poisoned images without affecting clean image accuracy.

Conclusion: TrueBiometric provides a practical, accurate, and effective defense against backdoor attacks in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

TL;DR: A novel adversarial camouflage framework improves attack success rates on deep object detectors by addressing gradient optimization challenges in variable physical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical adversarial camouflage poses security risks in safety-critical fields like autonomous driving, but existing techniques struggle with inconsistent sampling and gradient conflicts.

Method: The proposed framework uses gradient calibration for consistent updates across distances and gradient decorrelation to stabilize multi-angle optimization.

Result: The method achieves significant improvements, with ASR increases of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The framework enhances adversarial attack effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust system designs in real-world applications.

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmoothSA improves Slot Attention (SA) by preheating cold-start queries and differentiating transforms for video frames, enhancing object-centric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start queries in SA lack sample-specific cues, hindering precise aggregation, and non-first video frames require different transforms.

Method: SmoothSA preheats queries with input features and uses full/single iterations for first/non-first video frames.

Result: Validated on object discovery, recognition, and benchmarks, showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: SmoothSA addresses SA limitations, improving performance and providing intuitive insights.

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

*Hubert Baniecki,Maximilian Muschalik,Fabian Fumagalli,Barbara Hammer,Eyke Hüllermeier,Przemyslaw Biecek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIxLIP introduces a game-theory-based method for explaining vision-language model interactions, outperforming first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency maps fail to capture complex cross-modal interactions in vision-language models.

Method: FIxLIP uses the weighted Banzhaf interaction index for efficient decomposition of similarity in encoders.

Result: FIxLIP outperforms first-order methods on benchmarks like MS COCO and ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: FIxLIP provides high-quality explanations and is useful for comparing different vision-language models.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

### [120] [How and Why: Taming Flow Matching for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05461)
*Liangwei Li,Lin Liu,Juanxiu Liu,Jing Zhang,Ruqian Hao,Xiaohui Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised anomaly detection method using Flow Matching (FM) with time-reversed FM (rFM) and Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing expressivity limitations of conventional flow-based methods for anomaly detection and localization.

Method: Introduces rFM for transforming data distributions into Gaussian and WT-Flow for non-probabilistic paths, enhancing control over sample trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec dataset with a theoretically grounded separation mechanism.

Conclusion: FM provides a scalable, tractable framework for unsupervised anomaly detection, validated by superior results.

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

*Lumin Chen,Zhiying Wu,Tianye Lei,Xuexue Bai,Ming Feng,Yuxi Wang,Gaofeng Meng,Zhen Lei,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset (PAS) and a method (F2PASeg) for pituitary anatomy segmentation in surgery, addressing data scarcity and feature inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pituitary tumors risk damaging adjacent structures during surgery; segmentation can enhance safety, but annotated datasets are rare.

Method: PAS dataset with 7,845 images from 120 videos, augmented for class balance. F2PASeg uses a Feature Fusion module to handle occlusions and variations.

Result: F2PASeg achieves consistent real-time segmentation of critical structures, improving surgical planning.

Conclusion: F2PASeg provides a robust solution for pituitary surgery, leveraging the PAS dataset and feature fusion.

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

*Samuel Räber,Till Aczel,Andreas Plesner,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lossy image compression can defend against adversarial attacks, but realistic reconstructions increase attack difficulty. High-fidelity compression models resist attacks, while low-realism ones fail. Realism, not gradient masking, provides robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of lossy compression in defending against adversarial attacks and understand the role of image realism in robustness.

Method: Constructed strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models, analyzing attack difficulty in relation to reconstruction realism.

Result: High-realism compression models resist attacks, while low-realism ones are vulnerable. Realism, not gradient masking, provides inherent robustness.

Conclusion: Realistic reconstructions pose a challenge for adversarial attacks, suggesting realism is key for robust security evaluation.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

*Yunshuang Yuan,Frank Thiemann,Thorsten Dahms,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OND knowledge-based prompting for historical map segmentation, outperforming UNet with SMOL-MapSeg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps lack consistency, making pre-trained foundation models ineffective for segmentation.

Method: Introduces OND prompting to guide models, replacing SAM's prompt encoder and fine-tuning on historical maps.

Result: SMOL-MapSeg accurately segments classes and adapts to unseen ones, outperforming UNet.

Conclusion: OND prompting enhances segmentation for historical maps, offering flexibility and better performance.

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

TL;DR: AutoIAD is a multi-agent framework for automated industrial anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods in task completion and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual effort in industrial anomaly detection is inefficient; AutoIAD aims to automate the process for better scalability and performance.

Method: Uses a Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents and integrates a domain-specific knowledge base for end-to-end automation.

Result: Outperforms general-purpose agentic frameworks and AutoML in AUROC and task completion, with reduced hallucination issues.

Conclusion: AutoIAD is effective for industrial anomaly detection, with the Manager agent and knowledge base being key to its success.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

### [125] [Symmetry Understanding of 3D Shapes via Chirality Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05505)
*Weikang Wang,Tobias Weißberg,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised pipeline for extracting chirality-aware features from shapes (point clouds and meshes) using 2D foundation models, addressing a gap in current shape descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chirality information is crucial in shape analysis but is underdeveloped compared to the image domain. Current shape descriptors lack chirality-awareness, necessitating a dedicated feature extractor.

Method: The proposed method leverages the Diff3F framework to extract chirality features from 2D foundation models in an unsupervised manner.

Result: The extracted features were validated through experiments on tasks like left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation, showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work successfully fills the gap in chirality-aware shape descriptors, demonstrating practical utility in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI improves hand-object reconstruction from monocular videos by using novel view synthesis diffusion models as priors for unseen object regions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on object templates or assume full visibility, leading to implausible reconstructions in real-world scenarios with limited viewpoints.

Method: MagicHOI integrates a novel view synthesis model and visible contact constraints to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions.

Result: MagicHOI outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively regularizes unseen object regions using diffusion priors.

Conclusion: MagicHOI advances hand-object reconstruction by leveraging novel view synthesis priors, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

*Lin Zhu,Ruonan Liu,Xiao Wang,Lizhi Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised pre-training framework for event cameras enhances feature extraction from sparse, noisy data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in tasks like object recognition and optical flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution but produce sparse, noisy data, complicating feature extraction. This work aims to unlock latent information like edges and textures.

Method: The framework includes Difference-guided Masked Modeling for reconstructing temporal intensity differences, Backbone-fixed Feature Transition for preserving learned representations, and Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning for semantic discrimination.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks such as object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised pre-training framework effectively extracts features from event data, demonstrating robustness and superior performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The

*Zewei Wu,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced pedestrian tracking framework addresses occlusion challenges by integrating richer feature representations, head keypoint detection, and an iterative Kalman filtering motion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world pedestrian tracking faces occlusion issues, especially in crowded scenes, where traditional methods relying on full-body features and linear motion assumptions fail.

Method: The framework combines detection features from regression and classification branches, uses head keypoint detection for robustness, and employs iterative Kalman filtering with 3D priors for motion modeling.

Result: The method improves tracking stability and accuracy in occlusion-heavy environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded, occlusion-prone scenarios.

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

*Ekaterina Shumitskaya,Dmitriy Vatolin,Anastasia Antsiferova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel certified defense method for IQA models using randomized smoothing in feature space, preserving image quality while ensuring robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods degrade visual quality by injecting noise into input images; this method aims to maintain fidelity while providing robustness.

Method: Randomized smoothing in feature space, analyzing the Jacobian's maximum singular value to connect noise levels with input perturbations. Supports FR and NR IQA models without architectural changes.

Result: Reduces inference time by 99.5% without certification and 20.6% with certification. Improves correlation with subjective scores by up to 30.9%.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, preserves image quality, and outperforms existing certified defenses in robustness and performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Result: AI assistance increased throughput 6.03-fold, reduced errors 6.44-fold, and cut false positives 15.48-fold.

Conclusion: AI-assisted approaches can enhance clinical trial efficiency, speed up drug development, and reduce costs while ensuring compliance.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural pruning methods often ignore the interconnections among parameters, limiting their effectiveness. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes the Jacobian Criterion for evaluating parameter saliency and the Equivalent Pruning mechanism using autoencoders to retain contributions of pruned connections during fine-tuning.

Result: The Jacobian Criterion outperforms other metrics in preserving model performance, and Equivalent Pruning reduces performance degradation after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves structural pruning by considering parameter interconnections and mitigating performance loss.

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

TL;DR: SSTGNN is a lightweight graph neural network framework for detecting AI-generated videos, outperforming state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting AI-generated videos is challenging due to diverse manipulation types and reliance on isolated information in existing methods.

Method: SSTGNN uses a Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network with learnable spectral filters and temporal differential modeling to capture subtle manipulation traces.

Result: SSTGNN achieves superior performance in in-domain and cross-domain settings, with up to 42.4x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SSTGNN is effective, lightweight, and scalable for real-world deployment in detecting manipulated videos.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for

### [133] [AI vs. Human Moderators: A Comparative Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs in Content Moderation for Brand Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05527)
*Adi Levi,Or Levi,Sardhendu Mishra,Jonathan Morra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for brand safety classification in content moderation, introduces a new dataset, and evaluates their accuracy and cost efficiency compared to human reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of online video content has made human moderation insufficient, necessitating automated solutions like MLLMs for nuanced multimodal content moderation.

Method: The study introduces a novel multimodal and multilingual dataset, labeled by professionals, and evaluates MLLMs (Gemini, GPT, Llama) for brand safety classification.

Result: MLLMs show effectiveness in brand safety but have limitations and failure cases, as discussed. The dataset is released for future research.

Conclusion: MLLMs are promising for multimodal content moderation, but further research is needed to address their limitations. The released dataset supports this goal.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

*Federico Spurio,Emad Bahrami,Olga Zatsarynna,Yazan Abu Farha,Gianpiero Francesca,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Action Discovery addresses ambiguous and incomplete action annotations in partially labeled datasets by identifying known and unknown actions using granularity-guided segmentation and semantic class assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous or infrequent actions in partially labeled datasets, common in neuroscience and other domains.

Method: A two-step approach: Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) for temporal intervals and Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) for semantic class identification.

Result: Improved performance on datasets (Breakfast, 50Salads, Desktop Assembly) compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles partial annotations and discovers unknown actions, advancing temporal action segmentation.

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

*Kunyu Feng,Yue Ma,Xinhua Zhang,Boshi Liu,Yikuang Yuluo,Yinhan Zhang,Runtao Liu,Hongyu Liu,Zhiyuan Qin,Shanhui Mo,Qifeng Chen,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Instruction, an MLLM-driven framework for synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data to address the challenges of costly and time-consuming real-world data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for AI-generated content (AIGC) requires scalable, diverse, and high-quality data, but real-world data collection is expensive and slow. Existing methods rely on manual scene construction, limiting scalability and accuracy.

Method: The framework uses MLLM-Collector to gather assets and descriptions, MLLM-Generator and MLLM-Optimizer for 3D layout construction and semantic refinement, and MLLM-Planner for generating temporally coherent future frames.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 2D, 3D, and 4D tasks show the synthetic data significantly improves baseline model performance.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction is a scalable and effective solution for generating synthetic data to support generative intelligence.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

### [136] [DART: Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05585)
*Haijing Liu,Tao Pu,Hefeng Wu,Keze Wang,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART framework improves open-vocabulary multi-label recognition by refining intra-class localization and leveraging LLM-derived inter-class relational knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLP models struggle with fine-grained localization and lack explicit structured relational knowledge, limiting performance for unseen classes.

Method: DART uses Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) for intra-class refinement and Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) with a Class Relationship Graph (CRG) for inter-class transfer.

Result: DART achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: DART effectively integrates adaptive intra-class refinement and inter-class transfer, enhancing OV-MLR performance.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

*Shaobin Zhuang,Yiwei Guo,Canmiao Fu,Zhipeng Huang,Zeyue Tian,Ying Zhang,Chen Li,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeTok tokenizer improves vision generation with Group-wise Quantization (GQ) and Generative Decoding (GD), achieving better compression and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers struggle with balancing compression ratios and reconstruction fidelity.

Method: Introduces GQ for efficient quantization and GD for probabilistic modeling of visual data.

Result: Achieves record-low zero-shot rFID (0.12) and outperforms competitors in compression and fidelity.

Conclusion: WeTok sets a new standard for visual tokenizers with scalable and high-fidelity performance.

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

*Tao Sun,Oliver Liu,JinJin Li,Lan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-RE is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework for binary image-text relevancy evaluation, addressing diverse text formats and relevancy definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating image-text relevancy is challenging due to diverse text formats and varying relevancy definitions. MLLMs are ideal for this task due to their flexibility.

Method: LLaVA-RE uses the LLaVA architecture with detailed task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. A novel binary relevancy dataset is also proposed.

Result: Experimental results confirm the framework's effectiveness in binary image-text relevancy evaluation.

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE demonstrates the potential of MLLMs for flexible and accurate relevancy evaluation in multimodal AI.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

*Yuhan Zhang,Long Zhuo,Ziyang Chu,Tong Wu,Zhibing Li,Liang Pan,Dahua Lin,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi3DEval is a hierarchical framework for evaluating 3D generative content, combining object-level and part-level assessments with material realism. It outperforms image-based metrics and aligns better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D content quality assessment rely on image-based metrics and lack spatial coherence and material authenticity. Hi3DEval addresses these gaps.

Method: Hi3DEval uses a hierarchical framework with object-level and part-level evaluation, supported by Hi3DBench (a dataset with annotations) and a 3D-aware automated scoring system leveraging hybrid 3D representations.

Result: The approach outperforms image-based metrics in capturing 3D characteristics and aligns better with human preferences.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval provides a scalable and effective alternative to manual evaluations for 3D generative content.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

*Henghui Ding,Kaining Ying,Chang Liu,Shuting He,Xudong Jiang,Yu-Gang Jiang,Philip H. S. Torr,Song Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2 is a challenging dataset for video object segmentation (VOS) designed to address real-world complexities, showing current methods' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOS datasets lack real-world complexity, limiting generalization. MOSEv2 aims to bridge this gap.

Method: MOSEv2 introduces 5,024 videos with 701,976 masks, featuring complex scenarios like occlusions, adverse weather, and camouflaged objects.

Result: Benchmarking shows significant performance drops (e.g., SAM2 from 76.4% to 50.9%), highlighting current methods' struggles.

Conclusion: MOSEv2 advances VOS research by exposing gaps in handling real-world challenges, urging method improvements.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

*Weiqi Zhang,Junsheng Zhou,Haotian Geng,Wenyuan Zhang,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAP converts colorless 3D point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians using text guidance, multi-view optimization, and a depth-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians, especially for colorless point clouds, is an unsolved challenge.

Method: Uses a multi-view optimization framework with a depth-aware image diffusion model, surface-anchoring for geometric accuracy, and diffuse-based inpainting for hard-to-observe regions.

Result: Evaluated on synthetic and real-world point clouds, GAP successfully generates high-fidelity 3D Gaussians.

Conclusion: GAP effectively addresses the challenge of generating Gaussians from colorless point clouds, with applications across varying complexity levels.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

*Mohammed Talha Alam,Fahad Shamshad,Fakhri Karray,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer is a cancelable face generation framework that synthesizes privacy-preserving face images by mixing latent codes, ensuring revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility while maintaining recognition utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in face recognition by developing a method that protects identity while meeting biometric template protection requirements.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained generative model's latent space to mix real face latent codes with synthetic codes from revocable keys, refined via multi-objective loss.

Result: Generates high-quality cancelable faces compatible with existing FR systems, achieving superior recognition accuracy and stronger privacy protection (11% gain over recent methods).

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer effectively balances privacy protection and recognition utility, outperforming existing cancelable biometric methods.

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: JPS introduces a collaborative visual and textual method to jailbreak MLLMs, improving attack success and malicious intent fulfillment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak attacks focus on bypassing safety filters but often fail to produce harmful content, highlighting the need for a method that ensures malicious intent fulfillment.

Method: JPS combines adversarial image perturbations and optimized textual prompts, co-optimized iteratively, and introduces the MIFR metric for evaluation.

Result: JPS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both attack success rate (ASR) and malicious intent fulfillment rate (MIFR).

Conclusion: JPS effectively addresses the gap in jailbreak attacks by ensuring high-quality harmful outputs, validated by experiments and a novel evaluation metric.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a
significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on
maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated
responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight
frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack
substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,
\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation
and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of
visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes
target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,
complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to
specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual
and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced
performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the
Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a
Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new
state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with
analyses confirming its efficacy. Codes are available at

*Lishui Fan,Yu Zhang,Mouxiang Chen,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A unified RL framework improves code generation by evaluating reasoning quality, using a new benchmark (LCB-RB) and OD-based reward training. P-GRPO method aligns reasoning rewards with task success, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL for code generation ignores reasoning quality, risking reward hacking. A method to evaluate and reward reasoning while ensuring task success is needed.

Method: Developed LCB-RB benchmark for reasoning evaluation, OD-based reward training, and P-GRPO RL method to condition rewards on task success.

Result: A 7B model with P-GRPO outperforms baselines by 4.5%, matches GPT-4-Turbo, and generalizes to math tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates reasoning quality into RL, mitigating reward hacking and improving performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transformer-based models for hate speech detection, achieving top performance with fine-tuned ELECTRA on the MetaHate dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech on social media has severe real-world impacts, necessitating robust automated detection methods.

Method: Evaluated transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, ELECTRA) on the MetaHate dataset (1.2M samples).

Result: Fine-tuned ELECTRA achieved the highest F1 score (0.8980). Challenges include sarcasm and coded language.

Conclusion: Transformer models, especially ELECTRA, are effective for hate speech detection but face limitations with nuanced language.

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

### [147] [REINA: Regularized Entropy Information-Based Loss for Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04946)
*Nameer Hirschkind,Joseph Liu,Mahesh Kumar Nandwana,Xiao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces REINA, a novel loss function for Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems to optimize the tradeoff between translation quality and latency, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SimulST systems struggle to balance translation quality and latency. The paper aims to improve this tradeoff by waiting for more input only when it provides additional information.

Method: The authors propose REINA, a loss function derived from information theory, to train an adaptive policy using a non-streaming translation model.

Result: REINA achieves SOTA results on French, Spanish, and German translations, improving the latency/quality tradeoff by up to 21%.

Conclusion: REINA effectively optimizes the latency/quality tradeoff in SimulST systems, demonstrating significant improvements over prior methods.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

### [148] [R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004)
*Chengsong Huang,Wenhao Yu,Xiaoyang Wang,Hongming Zhang,Zongxia Li,Ruosen Li,Jiaxin Huang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Zero is a fully autonomous framework for self-evolving LLMs, generating its own training data without human input, improving reasoning capabilities significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM training relies on human-curated tasks, limiting scalability beyond human intelligence. R-Zero aims to overcome this by enabling autonomous self-improvement.

Method: R-Zero uses two co-evolving models (Challenger and Solver) that interact: the Challenger proposes tasks at the Solver's capability edge, and the Solver solves them, creating a self-improving curriculum.

Result: R-Zero boosts reasoning capabilities, e.g., improving Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math and +7.54 on general-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: R-Zero demonstrates scalable, autonomous LLM self-improvement, advancing AI beyond human-dependent training methods.

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

*Bingguang Hao,Maolin Wang,Zengzhuang Xu,Yicheng Chen,Cunyin Peng,Jinjie GU,Chenyi Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel reinforcement learning framework improves function calling in LLMs by addressing exploration, reasoning, and parameter verification challenges, achieving 86.02% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods for LLMs in function calling tasks lack robust reasoning and exploration, leading to superficial pattern matching and poor performance in complex scenarios.

Method: A two-stage data preparation pipeline with iterative LLM evaluation and AST validation, combined with strategic entropy-based exploration in reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 86.02% overall accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard, outperforming standard GRPO by 6% in complex multi-function scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances function calling performance, especially for code-pretrained models, and will be released to benefit the community.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

*Mason Nakamura,Saaduddin Mahmud,Kyle H. Wray,Hamed Zamani,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment) is a tuning-free, black-box-compatible method that balances alignment quality and computational cost by using a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is costly in terms of fine-tuning or inference, creating a trade-off between quality and cost. Existing methods ignore this balance.

Method: HIA employs a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference calls while maintaining alignment quality.

Result: HIA outperforms baselines like best-of-N sampling, beam search, and greedy search on real-world datasets (HelpSteer, ComPRed) under the same inference budget. It works well even with low budgets (1-2 queries).

Conclusion: HIA offers a practical, scalable solution for personalized LLM deployment by effectively balancing alignment quality and computational cost.

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

*Mengao Zhang,Jiayu Fu,Tanya Warrier,Yuwen Wang,Tianhui Tan,Ke-wei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination in LLMs for finance, proposing a framework to evaluate and mitigate it using context-aware masked span prediction on financial documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LLMs poses risks in finance due to reliance on precise numerical data. Existing benchmarks lack coverage of financial-specific requirements.

Method: Develops a framework with automated dataset creation (masking strategy), a new hallucination evaluation dataset from S&P 500 reports, and evaluates LLMs on financial tabular data.

Result: Provides a robust methodology for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework advances trustworthy financial Generative AI by addressing hallucination challenges.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

*Feiyu Wang,Guoan Wang,Yihao Zhang,Shengfan Wang,Weitao Li,Bokai Huang,Shimao Chen,Zihan Jiang,Rui Xu,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fairy±i introduces a 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs, surpassing the accuracy ceiling of full-precision models by leveraging the complex domain and enabling efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT research limits quantization to full-precision model accuracy. This work aims to surpass this ceiling by improving full-precision accuracy and then quantizing efficiently.

Method: The method maps weights to the fourth roots of unity (±1, ±i), creating a symmetric 2-bit representation. It enables multiplication-free inference using additions and swaps.

Result: Fairy±i outperforms existing 2-bit quantization methods in PPL and downstream tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: This work pioneers highly accurate and practical LLMs under extreme low-bit constraints, opening new research directions.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can generate interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) for clinical decision support, with iterative learning improving accuracy and reducing training needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore LLMs' potential for generating accurate CPs to enhance scalable clinical decision support for hypertension patients.

Method: Propose a synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy for iterative refinement of CPs using data-driven feedback.

Result: LLMs with iterative learning produce reasonably accurate CPs, nearing state-of-the-art ML performance with fewer training examples.

Conclusion: LLMs are promising for generating interpretable CPs, offering scalable clinical decision support with reduced training data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

*Chenkai Wu,Yuanyuan Qi,Xiaohao Yang,Jueqing Lu,Gang Liu,Wray Buntine,Lan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALScope is a new Deep Active Learning (DAL) platform for classification tasks, integrating diverse datasets and algorithms to enable fair and systematic evaluation under varied conditions like distribution shifts and data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified platform for evaluating DAL algorithms under diverse conditions (e.g., distribution shifts, data imbalance) motivated the creation of ALScope.

Method: ALScope integrates 10 datasets from CV and NLP, and 21 DAL algorithms, supporting flexible configuration of experimental factors like OOD ratio and class imbalance.

Result: Experiments show DAL performance varies by domain and setting, with room for improvement in non-standard scenarios (e.g., imbalanced, open-set) and trade-offs in selection time.

Conclusion: ALScope provides a comprehensive evaluation framework, highlighting the need for further research to improve DAL algorithms for complex real-world challenges.

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

*Jinhyeok Jang,Jaehong Kim,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KNOW prediction uses structured forgetting and inversion to create knowledge-enriched weights, outperforming traditional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve pre-trained weights by capturing more knowledge beyond the given dataset.

Method: Leverages structured forgetting via sequential fine-tuning on downsized datasets and reverses it using meta-learning (KNOWN model).

Result: KNOW prediction outperforms naive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction, enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: Reinterpreting forgetting dynamics can advance knowledge transfer in deep learning.

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes LIGHTYEAR, a decentralized P2P FL framework using local validation-based agreement scores for personalized and robust model aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of centralized FL (single point of failure, poor personalization, vulnerability to adversarial clients) and unreliable update selection in heterogeneous data settings.

Method: Introduces a P2P FL framework with agreement scores for semantic alignment of updates, enabling personalized aggregation with regularization.

Result: Outperforms centralized and existing P2P FL methods, especially in adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR offers a robust, personalized, and decentralized alternative to traditional FL, improving client-level performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

*Yue Duan,Taicai Chen,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: USP is a framework for semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) that enhances learning plasticity, unlabeled learning, and memory stability through feature space reservation, divide-and-conquer pseudo-labeling, and class-mean-anchored distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of SSCL, including balancing memory stability and learning plasticity while leveraging unlabeled data effectively.

Method: USP uses three strategies: Feature Space Reservation (FSR) for learning plasticity, Divide-and-Conquer Pseudo-labeling (DCP) for unlabeled learning, and Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for memory stability.

Result: USP outperforms prior SSCL methods, achieving up to 5.94% improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: USP effectively addresses SSCL challenges, demonstrating superior performance and practical utility.

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two parameter-free multi-view clustering algorithms, AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, using entropy regularization and SNR-based feature weighting for adaptive cross-view consensus and dimensionality reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multi-view clustering like high-dimensional features and lack of principled cross-view integration, the work aims to eliminate manual parameter tuning and irrelevant information.

Method: The algorithms replace fuzzification parameters with entropy regularization and SNR-based feature weighting ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$). AAMVFCM-U adds hierarchical dimensionality reduction via adaptive thresholding ($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$).

Result: Outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods, achieving 97% computational efficiency, reducing dimensionality to 0.45% of original size, and identifying optimal view combinations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a unified, parameter-free solution for multi-view clustering with adaptive feature and view balancing, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

TL;DR: A survey on unsupervised adaptation methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), categorizing approaches into four paradigms and reviewing benchmarks and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs show strong generalization but underperform in specific tasks without adaptation. Unsupervised methods are needed for data efficiency.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of four paradigms for unsupervised VLM adaptation, analyzing core methodologies and strategies.

Result: Provides a structured overview, benchmarks, and identifies open challenges in the field.

Conclusion: The survey bridges the gap in unified research on unsupervised VLM adaptation, offering insights for future work.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

*Qinghua Yao,Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VFL is a new Vertical Federated Learning framework addressing non-aligned data and missing features, enabling local inference with novel modules XCom and DS-Align.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of VFL: strict data alignment and lack of local inference support.

Method: Introduces XCom for feature completion and DS-Align for decision subspace alignment.

Result: Achieves 15% and 43% accuracy improvements on CIFAR-10 and MIMIC-III datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: X-VFL is effective for scenarios with missing features and local inference needs.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

*Ugur Cetintemel,Shu Chen,Alexander W. Lee,Deepti Raghavan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SPEAR introduces a structured language and runtime for managing prompts in LLM pipelines, enabling dynamic refinement and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompts in LLM pipelines are brittle and disconnected from dataflow, limiting reuse, optimization, and control.

Method: SPEAR provides a prompt algebra for dynamic refinement and structured management, supporting manual, assisted, and automatic modes.

Result: Preliminary experiments show SPEAR's effectiveness in refinement modes and optimizations like operator fusion.

Conclusion: SPEAR addresses prompt management gaps, making prompts adaptive and first-class components in LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

*Mahmoud Chick Zaouali,Todd Charter,Yehor Karpichev,Brandon Haworth,Homayoun Najjjaran*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A survey on integrating language models with Gaussian Splatting for 3D scene understanding, covering methods, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of combining language guidance with Gaussian Splatting, addressing gaps in current research.

Method: Structured review of existing research, detailing theoretical foundations, integration strategies, and use cases.

Result: Identifies key limitations like computational bottlenecks and lack of annotated data, alongside progress in text-conditioned 3D scene tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding using Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges
and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding
using Gaussian Splatting.

### [163] [Voost: A Unified and Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Bidirectional Virtual Try-On and Try-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04825)
*Seungyong Lee,Jeong-gi Kwak*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Voost is a unified framework using a diffusion transformer for virtual try-on and try-off, improving garment-body reasoning without extra networks or labels. It introduces inference techniques for robustness and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate garment-body correspondence in virtual try-on is challenging under pose and appearance variations.

Method: Voost jointly learns try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer, using bidirectional supervision and flexible conditioning. It includes attention temperature scaling and self-corrective sampling for robustness.

Result: Voost outperforms baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Voost's unified approach and inference techniques advance virtual try-on and try-off performance.

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

TL;DR: A novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting improves large-scale scene management and storage efficiency while maintaining real-time rendering and high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS struggles with large-scale scene management and storage, especially in complex environments or with limited resources.

Method: Proposes a scene perception compensation algorithm, pyramid sampling representation, and Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression for hierarchical Gaussian management.

Result: Significant improvements in memory efficiency and visual quality without compromising real-time rendering speed.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses scalability and storage challenges in 3DGS, enhancing practical usability.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

*Yifan Zhou,Beizhen Zhao,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions addresses challenges in dynamic scene modeling, improving fidelity and motion detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic 3DGS methods struggle with over-smoothing or feature collision due to spectral conflicts in motion detail preservation and deformation consistency.

Method: The framework includes spectral-aware Laplacian encoding, enhanced Gaussian dynamics attributes, and an adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex dynamic scenes with better fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances motion detail preservation and deformation consistency, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

*Fangyu Du,Taiqing Li,Ziwei Zhang,Qian Qiao,Tan Yu,Dingcheng Zhen,Xu Jia,Yang Yang,Shunshun Yin,Siyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RAP introduces a real-time framework for high-quality audio-driven portrait animation, using hybrid attention and static-dynamic training to achieve precise control and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for audio-driven portrait animation are computationally complex and unsuitable for real-time deployment due to latency and memory constraints.

Method: RAP employs a hybrid attention mechanism for fine-grained audio control and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm without explicit motion supervision.

Result: RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance with precise audio-visual synchronization and high visual fidelity under real-time constraints.

Conclusion: RAP successfully addresses the challenges of real-time audio-driven portrait animation, offering a practical and high-quality solution.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

### [167] [Refining Gaussian Splatting: A Volumetric Densification Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05187)
*Mohamed Abdul Gafoor,Marius Preda,Titus Zaharia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel density control method for 3D Gaussian Splatting improves reconstruction quality by using volumes of inertia and explores SfM/DIM for point cloud initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vanilla 3DGS densification strategy has shortcomings, prompting the need for a more effective method to manage point primitives for high-quality novel view synthesis.

Method: Introduces a density control method leveraging volumes of inertia for refinement and evaluates SfM and DIM for point cloud initialization.

Result: Outperforms 3DGS on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, achieving better reconstruction quality across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances 3DGS by addressing densification shortcomings and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

### [168] [Point cloud segmentation for 3D Clothed Human Layering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05531)
*Davide Garavaso,Federico Masi,Pietro Musoni,Umberto Castellani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A new 3D point cloud segmentation paradigm, 'clothed human layering,' is proposed to simultaneously associate points to different layers, improving semantic reconstruction for clothed body modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D cloth modeling is challenging due to variability and lack of semantic information in scans. Current segmentation methods are inadequate for layered garment reconstruction.

Method: Proposes a layered segmentation paradigm, creates a synthetic dataset, and evaluates neural network settings for coarse and fine-grained garment identification.

Result: Demonstrates benefits of proper segmentation strategies for garment domain on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances semantic reconstruction for clothed body modeling by addressing layered segmentation challenges.

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

*Chris Careaga,Yağız Aksoy*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A self-supervised method for realistic image relighting using neural rendering and physical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fully controllable, physically based illumination editing in real-world images, combining traditional rendering's accuracy with neural rendering's photorealism.

Method: Infer a colored mesh from monocular estimates, define desired 3D lighting, render with path-tracing, and refine with a neural renderer. Training is self-supervised via differentiable rendering.

Result: Achieves photorealistic relighting with explicit physical control, bridging the gap between 3D graphics tools and real-world images.

Conclusion: The method advances in-the-wild relighting by integrating physical and neural rendering, offering practical control over lighting.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

*Chitranshu Harbola,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based system for prescriptive maintenance combines vibration analysis with multi-agentic generation to provide actionable recommendations, improving industrial machinery maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance industrial maintenance by moving beyond anomaly detection to offer intelligent, actionable recommendations, bridging the gap between monitoring and planning.

Method: Integrates bearing vibration frequency analysis (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF) with LLM processing for anomaly detection and fault classification. Uses multi-agentic components for procedural knowledge retrieval and structured recommendation generation.

Result: Effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance validated on bearing vibration datasets.

Conclusion: The system advances LLM applications in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across sectors.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares three AWebGIS methods, finding a client-side fine-tuned small language model (SLM) most accurate and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, scalability, and internet dependency issues in current cloud-based AWebGIS solutions.

Method: Compared three approaches: cloud-based LLMs, offline classical ML classifiers, and client-side SLMs.

Result: Client-side SLM achieved highest accuracy (0.93 exact matching) and efficiency, reducing server load.

Conclusion: Browser-executable SLMs are feasible for AWebGIS, offering privacy, scalability, and offline capability.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthFlow is a self-evolving AI agent for healthcare that improves strategic planning through meta-level evolution, outperforming existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents in healthcare rely on static strategies, limiting their ability to improve strategic planning, which is crucial for complex tasks.

Method: HealthFlow uses a meta-level evolution mechanism to refine high-level problem-solving policies by learning from successes and failures. A new benchmark, EHRFlowBench, is introduced for evaluation.

Result: HealthFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks in experiments.

Conclusion: The work shifts focus from tool-users to self-evolving task-managers, advancing autonomous AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for spatial data integration but struggle with macro-scale reasoning. Providing relevant features improves performance, and a review-and-refine method effectively corrects errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based and machine learning methods for spatial data integration are limited, prompting exploration of LLMs as a flexible alternative.

Method: Analyzed LLMs' spatial reasoning, tested performance with relevant features, and adapted a review-and-refine method for error correction.

Result: LLMs perform well with relevant features but struggle with macro-scale reasoning. The review-and-refine method effectively corrects errors.

Conclusion: LLMs are a promising alternative for spatial data integration, with future research needed for post-training and multi-modal methods.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogniWeb, a modular web agent architecture inspired by dual-process theory, combining offline and online learning for efficient and effective web navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web navigation is a challenging domain for AGI, requiring complex decision-making in dynamic environments. Current approaches lack effective integration of offline and online learning paradigms.

Method: The paper proposes a decomposition into fast (System 1) and slow (System 2) cognitive processes, implemented in CogniWeb, which adaptively switches between intuitive and deliberative reasoning.

Result: CogniWeb achieves a 43.96% success rate on WebArena with a 75% reduction in token usage, demonstrating competitive performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The dual-process framework bridges offline and online learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for web navigation tasks.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

*Zhuohang Jiang,Pangjing Wu,Xu Yuan,Wenqi Fan,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QA-Dragon improves VQA by dynamically retrieving text and image knowledge, outperforming baselines in accuracy and knowledge overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods retrieve text or images separately, limiting complex query handling. QA-Dragon addresses this by enabling multimodal, multi-hop reasoning.

Method: QA-Dragon uses a domain router for subject identification and a search router for dynamic retrieval strategy selection, combining text and image search agents.

Result: QA-Dragon outperforms baselines by 5.06% (single-source), 6.35% (multi-source), and 5.03% (multi-turn) in the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge.

Conclusion: QA-Dragon effectively tackles complex VQA tasks by integrating dynamic multimodal retrieval, enhancing reasoning performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

### [176] [A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture combining decision trees and LLMs improves reasoning performance by integrating symbolic and neural methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust, interpretable, and extensible neuro-symbolic reasoning system by tightly coupling symbolic and neural modules.

Method: Embeds decision trees as callable oracles within a multi-agent framework, using LLMs for abductive reasoning and planning, with a central orchestrator for consistency.

Result: Achieves +7.2% entailment consistency on ProofWriter, +5.3% accuracy on GSM8k, and +6.0% abstraction accuracy on ARC.

Conclusion: The architecture provides a scalable and interpretable solution for neuro-symbolic reasoning, demonstrated in clinical and scientific applications.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Result: Found major misalignment: benchmarks focus on behavioral propensities (e.g., hallucination, bias) but neglect critical functional capabilities (e.g., loss-of-control scenarios).

Conclusion: Highlights the urgent need for policymakers and developers to address evaluation gaps to ensure safer and compliant AI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

### [178] [Can Large Language Models Generate Effective Datasets for Emotion Recognition in Conversations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05474)
*Burak Can Kaplan,Hugo Cesar De Castro Carneiro,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scarcity and bias in ERC datasets by using a small, efficient LLM to generate diverse datasets, improving classifier robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC datasets are scarce and biased, and LLMs are expensive for ERC tasks. The goal is to create diverse, synthetic datasets to enhance ERC benchmarks.

Method: A small, resource-efficient LLM is used to generate six novel ERC datasets, supplementing three widely used benchmarks.

Result: Generated datasets improve ERC classifier robustness and performance on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets effectively address ERC data challenges, enhancing model performance and robustness.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

*Wuqiang Zheng,Yiyan Xu,Xinyu Lin,Chongming Gao,Wenjie Wang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PaperEval is an LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation, improving novelty assessment and reasoning through domain-aware retrieval and latent reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying high-quality research amid increasing academic publications, and the limitations of current LLM-based methods in outdated knowledge and reasoning.

Method: PaperEval uses a domain-aware retrieval module and latent reasoning mechanism, with progressive ranking optimization for iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in academic impact and quality evaluation; successfully deployed in a real-world recommendation system with strong engagement.

Conclusion: PaperEval effectively addresses limitations of current methods, demonstrating practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

*MD Shaikh Rahman,Feiroz Humayara,Syed Maudud E Rabbi,Muhammad Mahbubur Rashid*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for improving mammographic image retrieval by comparing CNN architectures with advanced training strategies, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mammographic image retrieval systems face challenges like inadequate sample sizes and improper data splitting, limiting clinical translation.

Method: The study compares CNN architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) using advanced training strategies (fine-tuning, metric learning, super-ensemble optimization) with rigorous data splitting and validation.

Result: Advanced fine-tuning and super-ensemble optimization improved precision@10 significantly (e.g., 36.33% for super-ensemble, 24.93% over baseline). Statistical analysis confirmed large effect sizes (Cohen's d>0.8) and practical efficiency (2.8ms).

Conclusion: The framework sets new benchmarks for mammographic retrieval, offering evidence-based guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support.

Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS
categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly
greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in
literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological
limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and
insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN
architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies
including sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble
optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting
(50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic
validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced
fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:
DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,
19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary
architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),
representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases
per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences
between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's
d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds).
Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical
retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents
achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new
performance benchmarks while providing evidence-based architecture selection
guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support and quality assurance
applications.

### [181] [CryoGS: Gaussian Splatting for Cryo-EM Homogeneous Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04929)
*Suyi Chen,Haibin Ling*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: cryoGS is a new GMM-based method for cryo-EM reconstruction that avoids reliance on external initialization, enabling direct reconstruction from raw particle images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GMM-based methods for cryo-EM reconstruction depend on external consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their practicality in self-contained workflows.

Method: The paper introduces cryoGS, which integrates Gaussian splatting with cryo-EM physics, featuring innovations like orthogonal projection-aware splatting, a normalization term, and an FFT-aligned coordinate system.

Result: Experiments on real datasets show cryoGS is effective and robust compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: cryoGS provides a stable and efficient solution for homogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM, with potential for broader adoption due to its independence from external initialization.

Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at
near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM
is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large
collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically
interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained
interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external
consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in
self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a
GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM
image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware
Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and
FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these
innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly
from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental
results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS
over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

*Caner Özer,Patryk Rygiel,Bram de Wilde,İlkay Öksüz,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using implicit neural representations (INRs) for artifact detection in medical imaging, offering a compact, scalable solution with reduced memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in medical imaging hinder diagnostic accuracy, and current methods suffer from information loss and scalability issues due to high memory demands.

Method: The authors employ INRs for compact image representation and develop deep weight space networks, graph neural networks, and relational attention transformers for quality assessment.

Result: Tested on the ACDC dataset with synthetic artifacts, the method achieves comparable performance with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: INRs provide an efficient, scalable approach for artifact detection in medical imaging, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting
diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for
detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods
that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images,
thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we
propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality
assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical
images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while
reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural
networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve
image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with
synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: A pipeline for registering pre-surgery MR and post-resection US images using 3D CycleGAN for synthetic T1 generation and coarse-to-fine registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the consistency between MR and US images for better surgical planning and outcomes.

Method: Uses unpaired style transfer with 3D CycleGAN to create synthetic T1 images, followed by affine and local deformable transformations for registration.

Result: Enhanced registration performance and improved consistency between MR and US image pairs in most cases.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively bridges the gap between MR and US images, aiding surgical accuracy.

Abstract: We developed a pipeline for registering pre-surgery Magnetic Resonance (MR)
images and post-resection Ultrasound (US) images. Our approach leverages
unpaired style transfer using 3D CycleGAN to generate synthetic T1 images,
thereby enhancing registration performance. Additionally, our registration
process employs both affine and local deformable transformations for a

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AI models outperform pathologists in distinguishing Spitz tumors from melanomas and predicting genetic aberrations and diagnostic categories, potentially improving workflow efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spitz tumors are hard to differentiate from melanomas due to overlapping features, necessitating better diagnostic tools.

Method: AI models were trained on 393 Spitz tumors and 379 melanomas, validated using AUROC and accuracy, and compared to pathologists in a reader study. A simulation tested AI-based workflow impact.

Result: AI achieved AUROC 0.95 and accuracy 0.86 in differentiation, outperforming pathologists. Genetic aberration and diagnostic category predictions were better than random chance. AI could reduce costs and turnaround times.

Conclusion: AI models show strong performance in diagnosing Spitz tumors, offering potential workflow improvements, though challenges remain in genetic and category predictions.

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical
histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what
extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1)
distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the
underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic
category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a
dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive
performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of
the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a
reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate
the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic
testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on
UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in
differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic
aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly
guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where
random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models
performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not
statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the
simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary
diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and
examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive
performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas.
On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the
diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random
chance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MICoBot is a system for human-robot collaboration using Mixed-Initiative dialog, optimizing task allocation and communication to improve success and user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective long-horizon collaboration with diverse human partners whose behavior and capabilities may vary over time.

Method: MICoBot operates at three levels: meta-planning for strategy, planning for task allocation, and action execution for low-level decisions.

Result: Demonstrated improved task success and user experience in simulations and real-world tests with 18 participants.

Conclusion: MICoBot effectively collaborates with diverse humans, outperforming baselines like pure LLM and other allocation models.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

TL;DR: TAVP improves robotic manipulation by integrating active view planning and task-specific representation learning, outperforming fixed-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static viewpoints and shared visual encoders in VLA models limit 3D perception and cause task interference, reducing robustness and generalization.

Method: TAVP uses active view planning with a pseudo-environment for efficient exploration and a Mixture-of-Experts visual encoder to disentangle task features.

Result: TAVP achieves superior performance on RLBench tasks, enhancing action prediction and generalization.

Conclusion: TAVP's task-aware approach generates better visual representations, improving robustness and performance in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

TL;DR: DistillDrive is an end-to-end autonomous driving model using knowledge distillation and diversified instance imitation to improve planning-oriented understanding and decision-making robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving models overly focus on ego-vehicle status, lacking planning-oriented understanding, which limits decision-making robustness.

Method: Uses a planning model as a teacher for knowledge distillation, incorporates reinforcement learning for optimization, and generative modeling for planning-oriented instances.

Result: Achieves a 50% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point improvement in closed-loop performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets.

Conclusion: DistillDrive enhances autonomous driving robustness by integrating planning-oriented learning and diversified instance imitation.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve mobile robot navigation in crowds by incorporating pedestrian uncertainty estimates via adaptive conformal inference and constrained reinforcement learning, achieving higher success rates and robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots trained with reinforcement learning often degrade in performance when faced with out-of-distribution scenarios, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The method augments robot observations with prediction uncertainty estimates from adaptive conformal inference and uses constrained reinforcement learning to guide behavior.

Result: Achieves a 96.93% success rate in-distribution, with fewer collisions and intrusions, and demonstrates robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios like velocity variations and group dynamics.

Conclusion: The approach enables safe and robust navigation in real-world crowds, validated by deployment on a physical robot.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The study analyzes the Federal Reserve's communication during COVID-19, comparing it to past crises, using sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Findings show reactive communication, declining financial stability sentiment, and UMP as a 'new normal.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the Fed's communication strategies evolved during COVID-19 compared to past economic crises.

Method: Used specialized dictionaries, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to analyze Fed communication content, sentiment, and timing.

Result: Fed communication was more reactive during COVID-19; declining financial stability sentiment predicted accommodative policies; UMP communication became standard post-Global Financial Crisis.

Conclusion: The study highlights how central bank communication adapts during crises, with UMP now a key part of Fed strategy.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored applicability of LLMs in low-resource ASR settings.

Method: Uses the SLAM-ASR framework with a trainable projector between a speech encoder and LLM, testing data volume and pretrained projectors.

Result: Pretrained projectors reduce data scarcity impact, and multilingual LLMs improve performance on low-resource benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings guide future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for low-resource and multilingual ASR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken
inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in
various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in
low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a

we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance,
re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that
leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource
languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training
sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with
whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks,
providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for
low-resource languages and multilinguality.

Conclusion: Targeted error correction techniques significantly improve LLM-based RTL code generation performance.

Abstract: Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based
register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains
unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding
of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal
that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient
RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous
design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.
Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction
techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and
employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.
To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and
implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we
integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.
For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error
localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based
framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error
correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation
framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental
results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the
VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by
32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.
