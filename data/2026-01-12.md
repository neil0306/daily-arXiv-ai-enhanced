### [1] [Enhancing Foundation Models in Transaction Understanding with LLM-based Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05271)
*Xiran Fan,Zhimeng Jiang,Chin-Chia Michael Yeh,Yuzhong Chen,Yingtong Dou,Menghai Pan,Yan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid framework using LLM embeddings as semantic initialization for lightweight transaction models to balance semantic understanding with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transaction analysis models lose semantic information by converting rich textual merchant data into discrete tokens, while LLMs are too computationally expensive for real-time financial deployment.

Method: Uses LLM-generated embeddings as semantic initializations for lightweight models, employs multi-source data fusion for merchant enrichment, one-word constraint principle for consistent embeddings, and systematic noise filtering with context-aware enrichment.

Result: Significant performance improvements across multiple transaction understanding tasks on large-scale transaction datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully balances semantic understanding with operational efficiency, enabling better transaction analysis while maintaining real-time deployment feasibility.

Abstract: The ubiquity of payment networks generates vast transactional data encoding rich consumer and merchant behavioral patterns. Recent foundation models for transaction analysis process tabular data sequentially but rely on index-based representations for categorical merchant fields, causing substantial semantic information loss by converting rich textual data into discrete tokens. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can address this limitation through superior semantic understanding, their computational overhead challenges real-time financial deployment. We introduce a hybrid framework that uses LLM-generated embeddings as semantic initializations for lightweight transaction models, balancing interpretability with operational efficiency. Our approach employs multi-source data fusion to enrich merchant categorical fields and a one-word constraint principle for consistent embedding generation across LLM architectures. We systematically address data quality through noise filtering and context-aware enrichment. Experiments on large-scale transaction datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple transaction understanding tasks.

### [2] [The Table of Media Bias Elements: A sentence-level taxonomy of media bias types and propaganda techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05358)
*Tim Menzner,Jochen L. Leidner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a fine-grained, sentence-level taxonomy of media bias with 38 specific bias types organized into 6 functional families, moving beyond simplistic left-right political spectrum analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current public debates about media bias focus too narrowly on left-right political positioning, overlooking the concrete linguistic maneuvers that convey bias across the political spectrum. There's a need to shift from where outlets stand to how partiality is expressed at the sentence level.

Method: Researchers analyzed 26,464 sentences from newsroom corpora, user submissions, and browsing. They used iterative close-reading, interdisciplinary theory, and pilot annotation to develop a two-tier taxonomy with 38 elementary bias types organized into 6 functional families.

Result: Created a comprehensive "table of media-bias elements" with definitions, examples, cognitive drivers, and recognition guidance for each bias type. Quantitative analysis of 155-sentence sample showed prevalence differences, and cross-walk comparison with existing NLP and communication science taxonomies demonstrated substantial coverage gains and reduced ambiguity.

Conclusion: The research provides a more nuanced, sentence-level framework for analyzing media bias that transcends simplistic left-right categorization, offering improved analytical tools for both researchers and practitioners in media analysis and NLP.

Abstract: Public debates about "left-" or "right-wing" news overlook the fact that bias is usually conveyed by concrete linguistic manoeuvres that transcend any single political spectrum. We therefore shift the focus from where an outlet allegedly stands to how partiality is expressed in individual sentences. Drawing on 26,464 sentences collected from newsroom corpora, user submissions and our own browsing, we iteratively combine close-reading, interdisciplinary theory and pilot annotation to derive a fine-grained, sentence-level taxonomy of media bias and propaganda. The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a "table of media-bias elements". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition. A quantitative survey of a random 155-sentence sample illustrates prevalence differences, while a cross-walk to the best-known NLP and communication-science taxonomies reveals substantial coverage gains and reduced ambiguity.

### [3] [Lost in Execution: On the Multilingual Robustness of Tool Calling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05366)
*Zheng Luo,T Pranav Kutralingam,Ogochukwu N Okoani,Wanpeng Xu,Hua Wei,Xiyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLCL benchmark reveals multilingual tool-calling failures in LLMs due to parameter value language mismatch, with inference strategies reducing but not eliminating performance gaps vs. English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong tool-calling performance in English evaluations, their robustness in multilingual user interactions remains underexplored, particularly for non-English and low-resource languages.

Method: Introduce MLCL diagnostic benchmark and conduct systematic evaluation across Chinese, Hindi, and Igbo. Perform fine-grained error analysis and evaluate several inference-time system strategies to address identified issues.

Result: Many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. Parameter value language mismatch is identified as dominant failure mode where models generate semantically appropriate values in user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. Inference strategies reduce language-induced execution errors but cannot fully recover English-level performance.

Conclusion: Multilingual tool calling presents significant challenges beyond intent understanding, with language mismatch in parameter values being a key issue. Current inference strategies help but are insufficient to bridge the performance gap with English, highlighting need for improved multilingual tool-calling capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that invoke external tools through structured function calls. While recent work reports strong tool-calling performance under standard English-centric evaluations, the robustness of tool calling under multilingual user interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.

### [4] [Same Claim, Different Judgment: Benchmarking Scenario-Induced Bias in Multilingual Financial Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05403)
*Zhiwei Liu,Yupen Cao,Yuechen Jiang,Mohsinul Kabir,Polydoros Giannouris,Chen Xu,Ziyang Xu,Tianlei Zhu,Tariquzzaman Faisal,Triantafillos Papadopoulos,Yan Wang,Lingfei Qian,Xueqing Peng,Zhuohan Xie,Ye Yuan,Saeed Almheiri,Abdulrazzaq Alnajjar,Mingbin Chen,Harry Stuart,Paul Thompson,Prayag Tiwari,Alejandro Lopez-Lira,Xue Liu,Jimin Huang,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MFMD-Scen, a benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases in LLMs for multilingual financial misinformation detection across diverse economic scenarios, revealing persistent biases in both commercial and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit human biases from training data, which can cause instability in financial decision-making. Existing bias research focuses on simple settings, lacking consideration for complex real-world financial environments and high-risk multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks.

Method: Propose MFMD-Scen benchmark with three types of complex financial scenarios developed with financial experts: (1) role- and personality-based, (2) role- and region-based, (3) role-based with ethnicity/religious beliefs. Create multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. Evaluate 22 mainstream LLMs systematically.

Result: Pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source LLMs in financial misinformation detection tasks. The benchmark reveals systematic bias patterns in complex financial scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant behavioral biases in financial contexts, highlighting the need for bias-aware models in financial applications. The MFMD-Scen benchmark provides a comprehensive tool for evaluating these biases across diverse economic scenarios and languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\mfmd). In this work, we propose \mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.

*Jan Černý,Ivana Kvapilíková,Silvie Cinková*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers propose using information entropy from language models to estimate text readability, with a visualization tool to help improve bureaucratic text clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve readability and clarity of administrative/bureaucratic texts by developing a method to quantitatively estimate readability using information entropy.

Method: Propose a visualization framework that approximates information entropy of text using multiple language models, then visualizes the results to identify readability issues.

Result: Developed a libre software toolset (Glitter) available on GitHub that implements the proposed visualization framework for estimating text readability.

Conclusion: Information entropy from language models can effectively estimate text readability, and the visualization tool can help improve clarity of bureaucratic texts.

Abstract: This work investigates how measuring information entropy of text can be used to estimate its readability. We propose a visualization framework that can be used to approximate information entropy of text using multiple language models and visualize the result. The end goal is to use this method to estimate and improve readability and clarity of administrative or bureaucratic texts.

### [6] [Large Language Models Are Bad Dice Players: LLMs Struggle to Generate Random Numbers from Statistical Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05414)
*Minda Zhao,Yilun Du,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail at probabilistic sampling - batch generation has only 13% pass rate, independent requests completely collapse (10/11 models pass 0 distributions). Sampling fidelity degrades with complexity and larger sample sizes, causing downstream failures in MCQ generation and demographic targeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become integral to stochastic pipelines in domains like educational assessment and synthetic data construction, faithful sampling from specified probability distributions has become a functional requirement rather than theoretical curiosity.

Method: Large-scale audit of 11 frontier LLMs across 15 distributions using dual-protocol design: Batch Generation (N=1000 samples in one response) and Independent Requests (N=1000 stateless calls). Analyzed protocol asymmetry, distributional complexity effects, and downstream task propagation.

Result: Sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely (10/11 models pass none of distributions). Sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and worsens as sampling horizon N increases. Downstream failures observed in MCQ generation (uniform answer-position constraints) and demographic targeting in text-to-image synthesis.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees. The findings reveal fundamental limitations in LLMs' probabilistic sampling capabilities that propagate to real-world applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from chat interfaces to integral components of stochastic pipelines across domains like educational assessment and synthetic data construction, the ability to faithfully sample from specified probability distributions has become a functional requirement rather than a theoretical curiosity. We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees.

### [7] [Tracing Moral Foundations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05437)
*Chenxiao Yu,Bowen Yi,Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi,Suhaib Abdurahman,Jinyi Ye,Shrikanth Narayanan,Yue Zhao,Morteza Dehghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs represent moral foundations in structured, layer-dependent ways aligned with human judgments, with sparse features showing semantic links to specific foundations, and causal interventions demonstrate connection between internal representations and moral outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs' moral judgments reflect genuine internal conceptual structure or just superficial "moral mimicry" by examining how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within instruction-tuned LLMs.

Method: Multi-level approach using Moral Foundations Theory framework: (1) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and alignment with human perceptions, (2) pretrained sparse autoencoders to identify sparse features supporting moral concepts, (3) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features.

Result: Both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in structured, layer-dependent ways aligned with human judgments. SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms. Steering interventions produce predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior.

Conclusion: Moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting pluralistic moral structure can emerge from statistical regularities of language alone, providing mechanistic evidence against mere "moral mimicry."

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce human-like moral judgments, but it is unclear whether this reflects an internal conceptual structure or superficial ``moral mimicry.'' Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.

### [8] [Do LLMs Need Inherent Reasoning Before Reinforcement Learning? A Study in Korean Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05459)
*Hongjin Kim,Jaewook Lee,Kiyoung Lee,Jong-hun Shin,Soojong Lim,Oh-Woog Kwon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL alone fails to improve Korean reasoning in LLMs; aligning Korean-specific neurons in early layers via fine-tuning enables RL effectiveness, showing multilingual reasoning enhancement requires eliciting existing capabilities rather than adding new knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong reasoning in high-resource languages like English but perform poorly in low-resource languages like Korean. The study investigates whether reinforcement learning can enhance Korean reasoning to match English performance.

Method: Tested RL alone, found limited improvements. Explored fine-tuning strategies focusing on aligning internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers. Created a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate alignment.

Result: RL alone yields limited improvements without inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. Aligning Korean-specific neurons in early layers unlocks RL's effectiveness, leading to significant performance gains in mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks.

Conclusion: Multilingual reasoning enhancement requires eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities rather than injecting new linguistic knowledge. Internal translation and neuron-level tuning are key to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.

### [9] [Towards Valid Student Simulation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05473)
*Zhihao Yuan,Yunze Xiao,Ming Li,Weihao Xuan,Richard Tong,Mona Diab,Tom Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for simulating students with LLMs, addressing the "competence paradox" where powerful LLMs unrealistically emulate partially knowledgeable learners. It introduces Epistemic State Specification (ESS) for constrained generation and a Goal-by-Environment framework for situating simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based student simulations suffer from the "competence paradox" - highly capable models produce unrealistic error patterns when trying to emulate partially knowledgeable learners. This undermines the validity of using simulated students for educational research and pedagogical applications.

Method: The paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem using Epistemic State Specification (ESS) to define what simulated learners can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves. It also introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to categorize simulation systems by behavioral objectives and deployment contexts.

Result: The work synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions for LLM-based student simulation, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks. Rather than proposing new systems, it provides conceptual and methodological foundations.

Conclusion: The paper argues that epistemic fidelity (accurate representation of learner knowledge states) should be prioritized over surface realism for LLM-based simulated students to serve as reliable scientific and pedagogical instruments. This requires explicit modeling of learner constraints and knowledge evolution.

Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework for large language model (LLM) based student simulation in educational settings. The authors identify a core failure mode, termed the "competence paradox" in which broadly capable LLMs are asked to emulate partially knowledgeable learners, leading to unrealistic error patterns and learning dynamics. To address this, the paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem governed by an explicit Epistemic State Specification (ESS), which defines what a simulated learner can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves over time. The work further introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to situate simulated student systems according to behavioral objectives and deployment contexts. Rather than proposing a new system or benchmark, the paper synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks. Overall, the paper argues for epistemic fidelity over surface realism as a prerequisite for using LLM-based simulated students as reliable scientific and pedagogical instruments.

### [10] [The Facade of Truth: Uncovering and Mitigating LLM Susceptibility to Deceptive Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05478)
*Herun Wan,Jiaying Wu,Minnan Luo,Fanxiao Li,Zhi Zeng,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to sophisticated misleading evidence despite resisting direct misinformation. The paper introduces MisBelief framework to generate deceptive evidence and shows models' belief in falsehoods increases 93% on average. A defense mechanism called DIS is proposed to detect deceptive intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs can resist explicit misinformation but have fundamental vulnerabilities to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To reliably assist human decision-making, LLMs must maintain factual internal beliefs against such subtle attacks.

Method: Introduced MisBelief framework that generates misleading evidence through collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Generated 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Proposed Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS) as a governance mechanism to detect deceptive intent.

Result: While models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to refined misleading evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.

Conclusion: LLMs have critical vulnerabilities to sophisticated misleading evidence despite resisting direct misinformation. The proposed DIS mechanism provides effective early warning signals by inferring deceptive intent, helping maintain factual beliefs and reliable decision-making assistance.

Abstract: To reliably assist human decision-making, LLMs must maintain factual internal beliefs against misleading injections. While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.

### [11] [MemBuilder: Reinforcing LLMs for Long-Term Memory Construction via Attributed Dense Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05488)
*Zhiyu Shen,Ziming Wu,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian,Yanghui Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemBuilder is a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to build multi-dimensional memory for long-term dialogue consistency, using dense rewards and contribution-aware gradient weighting to outperform larger closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard retrieval mechanisms fail to capture temporal evolution in long-term dialogues, and current memory-augmented systems either rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training with sparse rewards.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework with two key innovations: 1) synthetic session-level question generation for dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories, and 2) contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each memory component's downstream impact.

Result: MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines and shows strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses challenges of sparse rewards and multi-dimensional memory attribution, demonstrating that properly trained smaller models can achieve superior long-term dialogue consistency compared to larger closed-source alternatives.

Abstract: Maintaining consistency in long-term dialogues remains a fundamental challenge for LLMs, as standard retrieval mechanisms often fail to capture the temporal evolution of historical states. While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.

### [12] [FlashMem: Distilling Intrinsic Latent Memory via Computation Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05505)
*Yubo Hou,Zhisheng Chen,Tao Wan,Zengchang Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlashMem is a framework that enables efficient long-term memory for LLMs by reusing computation from transient reasoning states, eliminating redundant processing while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to preserve dynamic context, forcing agents to redundantly reprocess history for long-horizon tasks. Current memory approaches use segregated architectures with auxiliary encoders that decouple memory from the reasoning backbone.

Method: FlashMem distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. It identifies the last hidden state as sufficient statistic for interaction history, uses a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending to the backbone's frozen cache, and employs a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor that uses attention entropy to trigger consolidation only during high epistemic uncertainty.

Result: FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively bridging the gap between efficiency and persistent cognition.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that efficient long-term memory can be achieved through computation reuse from existing reasoning states, eliminating the need for segregated memory architectures while maintaining both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The stateless architecture of Large Language Models inherently lacks the mechanism to preserve dynamic context, compelling agents to redundantly reprocess history to maintain long-horizon autonomy. While latent memory offers a solution, current approaches are hindered by architectural segregation, relying on auxiliary encoders that decouple memory from the reasoning backbone. We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. Furthermore, a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor leverages attention entropy to adaptively trigger consolidation only when high epistemic uncertainty is detected. Experiments demonstrate that FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively bridging the gap between efficiency and persistent cognition.

### [13] [CHisAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Event Taxonomy Construction in Ancient Chinese Cultural Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05520)
*Xuemei Tang,Chengxi Yan,Jinghang Gu,Chu-Ren Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CHisAgent is a multi-agent LLM framework for constructing historical taxonomies in ancient Chinese contexts, addressing LLMs' limitations in historical/cultural reasoning for non-English domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show limited ability in historical and cultural reasoning, especially in non-English contexts like Chinese history. Manual taxonomy construction is costly and doesn't scale, but taxonomic structures are effective for organizing historical knowledge and improving understanding.

Method: CHisAgent uses a multi-agent framework with three role-specialized stages: 1) bottom-up Inducer derives initial hierarchy from raw historical corpora, 2) top-down Expander introduces missing intermediate concepts using LLM world knowledge, and 3) evidence-guided Enricher integrates external structured historical resources for faithfulness. Applied to the Twenty-Four Histories to create domain-aware event taxonomies.

Result: Constructed a large-scale, domain-aware event taxonomy covering politics, military, diplomacy, and social life in ancient China. Extensive evaluations show improved structural coherence and coverage, with further analysis demonstrating that the resulting taxonomy supports cross-cultural alignment.

Conclusion: CHisAgent successfully addresses the scalability challenge of historical taxonomy construction for non-English contexts, creating a comprehensive ancient Chinese historical taxonomy that enhances LLM reasoning capabilities and supports cross-cultural understanding.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on many tasks, large language models (LLMs) show limited ability in historical and cultural reasoning, particularly in non-English contexts such as Chinese history. Taxonomic structures offer an effective mechanism to organize historical knowledge and improve understanding. However, manual taxonomy construction is costly and difficult to scale. Therefore, we propose \textbf{CHisAgent}, a multi-agent LLM framework for historical taxonomy construction in ancient Chinese contexts. CHisAgent decomposes taxonomy construction into three role-specialized stages: a bottom-up \textit{Inducer} that derives an initial hierarchy from raw historical corpora, a top-down \textit{Expander} that introduces missing intermediate concepts using LLM world knowledge, and an evidence-guided \textit{Enricher} that integrates external structured historical resources to ensure faithfulness. Using the \textit{Twenty-Four Histories}, we construct a large-scale, domain-aware event taxonomy covering politics, military, diplomacy, and social life in ancient China. Extensive reference-free and reference-based evaluations demonstrate improved structural coherence and coverage, while further analysis shows that the resulting taxonomy supports cross-cultural alignment.

### [14] [Double: Breaking the Acceleration Limit via Double Retrieval Speculative Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05524)
*Yuhao Shen,Tianyu Liu,Junyi Shen,Jinyang Wu,Quan Kong,Li Huan,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Double introduces a novel parallel speculative decoding framework that breaks theoretical speedup limits by enabling iterative retrieval speculations and authoritative multi-token guidance to reduce rejection waste.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallel Speculative Decoding has two fundamental limitations: 1) a theoretical speedup ceiling limited by draft/target model speed ratio, and 2) high computational waste from mid-sequence token rejections causing pipeline stalls.

Method: Double bridges SD and PSD with synchronous retrieval mechanism: draft model performs iterative retrieval speculations to break speed limits, while target model performs authoritative retrieval to generate multi-token guidance, eliminating rollback needs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art speedup of 5.3× on LLaMA3.3-70B and 2.8× on Qwen3-32B, significantly outperforming EAGLE-3 which requires extensive model training.

Conclusion: Double provides a training-free, lossless solution that overcomes fundamental limitations of parallel speculative decoding through innovative retrieval mechanisms, achieving unprecedented speedup without model training.

Abstract: Parallel Speculative Decoding (PSD) accelerates traditional Speculative Decoding (SD) by overlapping draft generation with verification. However, it remains hampered by two fundamental challenges: (1) a theoretical speedup ceiling dictated by the speed ratio between the draft and target models, and (2) high computational waste and pipeline stall due to mid-sequence token rejections of early errors. To address these limitations, we introduce \textsc{Double} (Double Retrieval Speculative Parallelism). By bridging the gap between SD and PSD, our framework resolves the Retrieval \emph{Precision-Efficiency Dilemma} through a novel synchronous mechanism. Specifically, we enable the draft model to execute iterative retrieval speculations to break the theoretical speedup limits; to alleviate rejections without rollback, the target model performs authoritative retrieval to generate multi-token guidance. \textsc{Double} is entirely training-free and lossless.

TL;DR: TARS is a reinforcement learning framework that reduces the reasoning gap between speech and text inputs in speech LLMs by aligning speech- and text-conditioned trajectories through representation and behavior alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech large language models show significantly weaker reasoning performance on speech inputs compared to text inputs, which is attributed to representational drift across Transformer layers and behavior deviations in long-chain reasoning.

Method: TARS uses reinforcement learning with asymmetric reward design to align text-conditioned and speech-conditioned trajectories. It employs two complementary signals: representation alignment (measuring layer-wise hidden-state similarity) and behavior alignment (evaluating semantic consistency between generated outputs and reference text completions).

Result: Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (MMSU and OBQA) show that TARS significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.

Conclusion: The TARS framework effectively addresses the modality reasoning gap in speech LLMs through reinforcement learning with dual alignment signals, demonstrating improved reasoning performance on speech inputs.

Abstract: Although speech large language models have achieved notable progress, a substantial modality reasoning gap remains: their reasoning performance on speech inputs is markedly weaker than on text. This gap could be associated with representational drift across Transformer layers and behavior deviations in long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce TARS, a reinforcement-learning framework that aligns text-conditioned and speech-conditioned trajectories through an asymmetric reward design. The framework employs two dense and complementary signals: representation alignment, which measures layer-wise hidden-state similarity between speech- and text-conditioned trajectories, and behavior alignment, which evaluates semantic consistency between generated outputs and reference text completions. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MMSU and OBQA, show that our approach significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.

*Hongjin Kim,Jeonghyun Kang,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs and AES systems fail to detect harmful content in essays, scoring ethically problematic essays highly. New HED benchmark reveals need for ethical sensitivity in automated scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AES systems and LLMs overlook ethically problematic elements in essays, often giving high scores to essays containing harmful opinions about sensitive topics like racism and gender bias.

Method: Created the Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark containing essays with sensitive topics (racism, gender bias) to test LLMs' ability to recognize and score harmful content.

Result: (1) LLMs need improvement to distinguish harmful from argumentative essays; (2) Both AES models and LLMs fail to consider ethical dimensions during scoring.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need to develop more robust AES systems that are sensitive to ethical implications of content, addressing current gaps in harmful content detection.

Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) with regard to their ability to effectively identify and score harmful essays. Despite advancements in AES technology, current models often overlook ethically and morally problematic elements within essays, erroneously assigning high scores to essays that may propagate harmful opinions. In this study, we introduce the Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark, which includes essays integrating sensitive topics such as racism and gender bias, to test the efficacy of various LLMs in recognizing and scoring harmful content. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs require further enhancement to accurately distinguish between harmful and argumentative essays, and (2) both current AES models and LLMs fail to consider the ethical dimensions of content during scoring. The study underscores the need for developing more robust AES systems that are sensitive to the ethical implications of the content they are scoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KEEM dataset enhances memory updates in conversational AI by dynamically generating integrative memories that preserve factual info, emotional context, and causal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory approaches in long-term conversational systems use simple accumulation or operation-based methods that cause information conflicts and struggle to track users' current states accurately.

Method: Introduces the Keep Emotional and Essential Memory (KEEM) dataset, a generation-based dataset that dynamically creates integrative memories combining factual information, emotional context, and causal relationships.

Result: The approach enables more nuanced understanding of user interactions, promotes deeper empathy, and enhances the system's ability to respond meaningfully in open-domain conversations.

Conclusion: KEEM dataset provides a novel solution for memory updates in conversational systems that goes beyond traditional methods by integrating both emotional and essential data for more effective long-term interactions.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Keep Emotional and Essential Memory (KEEM) dataset, a novel generation-based dataset designed to enhance memory updates in long-term conversational systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on simple accumulation or operation-based methods, which often result in information conflicts and difficulties in accurately tracking a user's current state, KEEM dynamically generates integrative memories. This process not only preserves essential factual information but also incorporates emotional context and causal relationships, enabling a more nuanced understanding of user interactions. By seamlessly updating a system's memory with both emotional and essential data, our approach promotes deeper empathy and enhances the system's ability to respond meaningfully in open-domain conversations.

*Junyao Yang,Chen Qian,Dongrui Liu,Wen Shen,Yong Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasonAny is a novel model merging framework that enables domain-specialized models to acquire reasoning capabilities without performance collapse, using contrastive gradient identification to address the challenge that reasoning ability resides in low gradient sensitivity regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of equipping domain-specialized models with reasoning capabilities ("Reasoning + X"). While model merging offers a training-free solution, existing methods suffer from destructive performance collapse that weakens both reasoning depth and domain-specific utility. The authors discovered a counter-intuitive phenomenon: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to common assumptions.

Method: ReasonAny is a novel merging framework that resolves reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification. The method leverages the insight about reasoning ability residing in low gradient sensitivity regions to effectively synthesize reasoning capabilities with domain-specific models.

Result: Experiments across safety, biomedicine, and finance domains show that ReasonAny effectively synthesizes "Reasoning + X" capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining robust reasoning performance.

Conclusion: ReasonAny provides an effective solution to the "Reasoning + X" challenge by addressing the fundamental issue of reasoning ability residing in low gradient sensitivity regions, enabling domain-specialized models to acquire reasoning capabilities without compromising their domain utility.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with long chain-of-thought reasoning have recently achieved remarkable success. Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as "Reasoning + X", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification. Experiments across safety, biomedicine, and finance domains show that ReasonAny effectively synthesizes "Reasoning + X" capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining robust reasoning performance.

*Sung-Yoo Lim,Koki Sato,Kiyoshi Takami,Giancarlos Parady,Eui-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can automate extraction of explicit decision-making factors from group chats but struggle with nuanced implicit factors, requiring human oversight for complex social activity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional travel surveys can't capture complex joint activity-travel decisions in social groups, and manual annotation of unstructured chat data is labor-intensive. LLMs offer potential to automate interpretation of decision-making processes from group chats.

Method: Designed a prompting framework inspired by knowledge acquisition process to sequentially extract decision-making factors from Japanese group chats about eating-out activities. Framework extracts group-level restaurant choice sets, individual preferences, and specific attributes driving preferences, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data.

Result: LLMs reliably capture explicit decision-making factors but struggle with nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identify. Quantitative analysis using human-annotated ground truth and qualitative error analysis reveal specific contexts where LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight is essential.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for automating analysis of non-traditional data sources on social activities but have limitations in capturing implicit factors. Findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LLM-based approaches, indicating where human oversight remains essential for complex social decision-making analysis.

Abstract: Social activities result from complex joint activity-travel decisions between group members. While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based analysis for incorporating non-traditional data sources on social activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACR framework dynamically reshapes dialogue history to address contextual inertia and state drift in LLM multi-turn conversations, outperforming baselines while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with maintaining alignment, following dependencies, and avoiding factual drift in long multi-turn dialogues. Existing approaches (extended context windows, external memory, context compression) still suffer from contextual inertia and state drift problems.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Context Refactoring (ACR) Framework: 1) Library of context refactoring operators, 2) Teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, decoupling context management from reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue show ACR significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.

Conclusion: ACR effectively addresses contextual inertia and state drift in multi-turn dialogues through dynamic context monitoring and reshaping, offering a promising approach for improving LLM dialogue consistency and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-turn dialogue. However, in multi-turn dialogue, models still struggle to stay aligned with what has been established earlier, follow dependencies across many turns, and avoid drifting into incorrect facts as the interaction grows longer. Existing approaches primarily focus on extending the context window, introducing external memory, or applying context compression, yet these methods still face limitations such as \textbf{contextual inertia} and \textbf{state drift}. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{R}efactoring \textbf{(ACR)} Framework, which dynamically monitors and reshapes the interaction history to mitigate contextual inertia and state drift actively. ACR is built on a library of context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, thereby decoupling context management from the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.

*Abayomi O. Agbeyangi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid approach for automatic text detoxification in low-resource African languages (isiXhosa and Yorùbá), combining interpretable toxicity detection with controlled rewriting, achieving effective detoxification while preserving non-toxic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxic language is a major barrier to safe online participation, but robust mitigation tools are scarce for African languages. The study addresses this critical gap by focusing on automatic text detoxification for two low-resource African languages.

Method: A novel hybrid methodology: 1) Lightweight, interpretable TF-IDF and Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, and 2) Controlled lexicon- and token-guided rewriting component. A parallel corpus of toxic to neutral rewrites was developed to train and evaluate the model.

Result: Toxicity detection achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yorùbá), with ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences.

Conclusion: Scalable, interpretable machine learning detectors combined with rule-based edits offer a competitive and resource-efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tooling, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer in African languages.

Abstract: Toxic language is one of the major barrier to safe online participation, yet robust mitigation tools are scarce for African languages. This study addresses this critical gap by investigating automatic text detoxification (toxic to neutral rewriting) for two low-resource African languages, isiXhosa and Yorùbá. The work contributes a novel, pragmatic hybrid methodology: a lightweight, interpretable TF-IDF and Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, and a controlled lexicon- and token-guided rewriting component. A parallel corpus of toxic to neutral rewrites, which captures idiomatic usage, diacritics, and code switching, was developed to train and evaluate the model. The detection component achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yorùbá), with per-language ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences. These results demonstrate that scalable, interpretable machine learning detectors combined with rule-based edits offer a competitive and resource-efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tooling, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer (TST) in African languages.

*Nuoyan Lyu,Bingbing Xu,Weihao Meng,Yige Yuan,Yang Zhang,Zhiyong Huang,Tat-Seng Chua,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using games as environments for LLM informal learning to develop practical wisdom and generalizable intelligence, introducing a Nested Training Framework to prevent task interference in multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at formal learning tasks but lack "practical wisdom" and generalizable intelligence like strategic creativity and social reasoning. This gap stems from insufficient informal learning, which requires interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction.

Method: Proposes using Games as primary environments for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic rewards and abstracted complexity. Introduces a Nested Training Framework with sequential task composition to enforce explicit "AND" objectives (mastering multiple abilities simultaneously) rather than implicit "OR" objectives of naive task mixing. Uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games.

Result: Game-based informal learning prevents task interference and significantly enhances model generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks. The framework and implementation are publicly available.

Conclusion: Games provide effective environments for cultivating diverse competencies in LLMs through informal learning, and the proposed Nested Training Framework successfully addresses performance degradation in multi-task learning while improving generalization capabilities.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in formal learning tasks such as mathematics and code generation, they still struggle with the "practical wisdom" and generalizable intelligence, such as strategic creativity and social reasoning, that characterize human cognition. This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit "OR" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit "AND" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks. The framework and implementation are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual unlearning study using Aya-Expanse 8B model shows asymmetric cross-lingual transfer effects, with high-resource languages being more stable and syntactic similarity being the strongest predictor of unlearning behavior across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs present unique safety and fairness challenges across diverse linguistic contexts, but existing unlearning research focuses mainly on English monolingual settings. There's a need to understand how unlearning works in multilingual environments with cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases from pretraining/fine-tuning data.

Method: Used Aya-Expanse 8B model for multilingual unlearning in two settings: data unlearning and concept unlearning. Extended benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages (English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, Indonesian) through translation, covering five language families and varying resource levels.

Result: Unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable. Asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Linguistic distance analysis shows syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.

Conclusion: Multilingual unlearning exhibits complex cross-lingual dynamics, with syntactic similarity playing a crucial role in transfer effects. High-resource languages show more stable unlearning, and asymmetric transfer patterns between related languages highlight the need for language-aware unlearning approaches.

Abstract: As multilingual large language models become more widely used, ensuring their safety and fairness across diverse linguistic contexts presents unique challenges. While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.

TL;DR: A framework for personalized persuasiveness prediction that uses context-aware user profiling with query generation and profiling components to leverage users' historical data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current persuasiveness prediction models lack systematic frameworks to effectively leverage users' past activities and characteristics (values, experiences, reasoning styles) for personalized predictions, despite the importance of considering target persuadee's attributes.

Method: Proposes a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: 1) a query generator that creates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from user history, and 2) a profiler that summarizes these records into profiles to inform persuasiveness prediction models.

Result: Evaluation on ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Analysis reveals effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction, demonstrating that dynamic, context-aware approaches outperform static attribute-based methods.

Abstract: Estimating the persuasiveness of messages is critical in various applications, from recommender systems to safety assessment of LLMs. While it is imperative to consider the target persuadee's characteristics, such as their values, experiences, and reasoning styles, there is currently no established systematic framework to optimize leveraging a persuadee's past activities (e.g., conversations) to the benefit of a persuasiveness prediction model. To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.

TL;DR: Stephanie2 is a step-wise dialogue agent with active waiting and message-pace adaptation that outperforms Stephanie1 in naturalness and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI chatting systems lack active waiting mechanisms and exhibit unnatural message pacing when splitting one-shot generation into multiple sequential messages.

Method: Stephanie2 uses active waiting and message-pace adaptation, explicitly deciding at each step whether to send or wait, modeling latency as thinking time + typing time. Also introduces time-window-based dual-agent dialogue system for generating pseudo dialogue histories.

Result: Stephanie2 clearly outperforms Stephanie1 on metrics like naturalness and engagement, and achieves higher pass rate on human evaluation with role identification Turing test.

Conclusion: Stephanie2 successfully addresses unnatural pacing issues in step-wise dialogue agents through active waiting and message-pace adaptation mechanisms.

Abstract: Instant-messaging human social chat typically progresses through a sequence of short messages. Existing step-by-step AI chatting systems typically split a one-shot generation into multiple messages and send them sequentially, but they lack an active waiting mechanism and exhibit unnatural message pacing. In order to address these issues, we propose Stephanie2, a novel next-generation step-wise decision-making dialogue agent. With active waiting and message-pace adaptation, Stephanie2 explicitly decides at each step whether to send or wait, and models latency as the sum of thinking time and typing time to achieve more natural pacing. We further introduce a time-window-based dual-agent dialogue system to generate pseudo dialogue histories for human and automatic evaluations. Experiments show that Stephanie2 clearly outperforms Stephanie1 on metrics such as naturalness and engagement, and achieves a higher pass rate on human evaluation with the role identification Turing test.

TL;DR: Afri-MCQA is the first multilingual cultural QA benchmark covering 15 African languages with 7.5k parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech, created by native speakers. LLMs perform poorly on African languages, especially in speech, highlighting the need for speech-first approaches and culturally grounded AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Africa has over one-third of the world's languages but is underrepresented in AI research. There's a lack of benchmarks that capture both linguistic and cultural aspects of African languages across modalities (text and speech).

Method: Created Afri-MCQA benchmark with 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries, entirely by native speakers. Includes parallel English-African language pairs across text and speech modalities. Conducted benchmarking experiments with LLMs, including control experiments to separate linguistic competence from cultural knowledge.

Result: Open-weight LLMs perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. Significant performance gaps exist between native languages and English for both text and speech modalities. Models struggle particularly with speech input and cultural knowledge.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgent need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer. The Afri-MCQA benchmark is released to support more inclusive multimodal AI development in African languages.

Abstract: Africa is home to over one-third of the world's languages, yet remains underrepresented in AI research. We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer.

*Zhaolin Li,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech LLMs can learn unseen endangered languages through multimodal in-context learning (MICL) using both speech and text, enabling improved ASR without target-language training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most languages lack ASR coverage due to data scarcity. While ICL with LLMs helps, prior work focuses on high-resource languages and text-only settings. This paper explores whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages through multimodal ICL and improve ASR for endangered languages.

Method: Experiments with Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni speech LLMs on three endangered languages. Investigates MICL effectiveness, cross-lingual transfer learning, attention pattern analysis, and proposes a hybrid ASR system combining stronger acoustic models with speech LLMs via MICL-based hypothesis selection.

Result: MICL effectively learns unseen languages using both modalities. Cross-lingual transfer improves MICL efficiency without target-language training. Attention analysis shows layer-dependent modality preferences with text bias. Prompt-based ASR performs poorly, but the proposed hybrid system with MICL selection consistently improves ASR, matching/exceeding corpus-trained LMs without target data.

Conclusion: Speech LLMs can learn unseen endangered languages through multimodal ICL, enabling effective ASR without supervised data. Cross-lingual transfer learning and hybrid acoustic-LLM systems with MICL-based selection offer promising solutions for low-resource language ASR.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) still covers only a small fraction of the world's languages, mainly due to supervised data scarcity. In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data.

Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing LLM representations focus only on isolated word embeddings and ignore the context and information flow within natural language expressions, limiting understanding of how LLMs process actual language.

Method: Applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to word embeddings to visualize and analyze information flow between embeddings, tracking flows across LLM layers and comparing different model structures.

Result: DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings, allows comparison of different model structures, identifies opportunities for pruning under-utilized layers, and shows differences in information flows for specific NLP tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection.

Conclusion: The DTI-based approach provides novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending beyond isolated word embeddings and improving interpretability of NLP models.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent natural language is a central challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models.

### [30] [Analysing Differences in Persuasive Language in LLM-Generated Text: Uncovering Stereotypical Gender Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05751)
*Amalie Brogaard Pauli,Maria Barrett,Max Müller-Eberstein,Isabelle Augenstein,Ira Assent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generate gender-biased persuasive language that reflects societal stereotypes when targeting different recipient genders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used for interpersonal communication and persuasion, it's crucial to understand how user instructions affect persuasive language generation, particularly whether generated language differs when targeting different demographic groups like gender.

Method: Proposed evaluation framework assessing how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, and output language. Evaluated 13 LLMs across 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions, then analyzed model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science.

Result: Found significant gender differences in persuasive language generated across all models, with patterns reflecting biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.

Conclusion: LLMs reproduce and amplify existing gender stereotypes in persuasive communication, highlighting the need for careful consideration of how these models are deployed for interpersonal messaging tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for everyday communication tasks, including drafting interpersonal messages intended to influence and persuade. Prior work has shown that LLMs can successfully persuade humans and amplify persuasive language. It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models. These patterns reflect biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.

*Shu Yang,Jingyu Hu,Tong Li,Hanqi Yan,Wenxuan Wang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMonitor-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes, revealing reliability challenges and safety-utility trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across different tasks and failure modes, as current monitoring approaches lack comprehensive benchmarks to assess their performance and limitations.

Method: Created AutoMonitor-Bench with 3,010 annotated test samples across QA, code generation, and reasoning tasks with paired misbehavior/benign instances. Evaluated 22 LLMs using Miss Rate and False Alarm Rate metrics. Also fine-tuned Qwen3-4B-Instruction on a 153,581-sample training corpus to test if training improves monitoring on unseen misbehaviors.

Result: Found substantial variability in monitoring performance across models, consistent MR-FAR trade-off revealing safety-utility tension. Training on known misbehavior datasets showed limited improvement on unseen, implicit misbehaviors.

Conclusion: Reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring remains challenging, motivating future work on task-aware design and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.

Abstract: We introduce AutoMonitor-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes. AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.

### [32] [One Script Instead of Hundreds? On Pretraining Romanized Encoder Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05776)
*Benedikt Ebing,Lennart Keller,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Romanization improves cross-lingual transfer for low-resource non-Latin languages but may harm high-resource languages; this paper investigates performance degradation sources for high-resource languages with different script types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work focused on romanization benefits for low-resource non-Latin languages, but it's unclear if romanization harms performance for high-resource languages due to information loss, especially for general-purpose multilingual language model pretraining.

Method: Pretrained encoder language models from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles. Investigated two degradation sources: script-specific information loss and negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap.

Result: Negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, but degradation for morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese/Japanese) that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. No evidence that increased subword overlap causes negative interference. Romanization improves encoding efficiency for segmental scripts with minimal performance cost.

Conclusion: Romanization is generally beneficial for segmental-script languages with minimal performance cost, but problematic for morphosyllabic scripts where information loss is significant. Increased vocabulary overlap doesn't cause negative interference, making romanization a viable strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer in multilingual models.

Abstract: Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost.

TL;DR: Comparative study of fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering for text simplification with LLMs, finding fine-tuning better for structural simplification while prompting achieves higher semantic similarity but copies inputs more.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a practical tradeoff between fine-tuning and prompt engineering for text simplification tasks with LLMs, and the paper aims to systematically compare both approaches across multiple benchmarks.

Method: Introduces Simplify-This, a comparative study evaluating both fine-tuning and prompt engineering paradigms for text simplification using encoder-decoder LLMs across multiple benchmarks with various evaluation metrics.

Result: Fine-tuned models consistently deliver stronger structural simplification, while prompting often attains higher semantic similarity scores but tends to copy inputs more. Human evaluation favors fine-tuned outputs overall.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is generally more effective for text simplification than prompt engineering, though each approach has different strengths. The study releases code, datasets, model checkpoints, and prompt templates to support reproducibility and future work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable strong text generation, and in general there is a practical tradeoff between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. We introduce Simplify-This, a comparative study evaluating both paradigms for text simplification with encoder-decoder LLMs across multiple benchmarks, using a range of evaluation metrics. Fine-tuned models consistently deliver stronger structural simplification, whereas prompting often attains higher semantic similarity scores yet tends to copy inputs. A human evaluation favors fine-tuned outputs overall. We release code, a cleaned derivative dataset used in our study, checkpoints of fine-tuned models, and prompt templates to facilitate reproducibility and future work.

*Xiaoshuai Song,Haofei Chang,Guanting Dong,Yutao Zhu,Zhicheng Dou,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnvScaler is an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis to improve LLM agent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for training LLMs as agents face limitations: real system access is restricted, LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations/inconsistencies, and manual sandboxes don't scale.

Method: EnvScaler has two components: SkelBuilder creates diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation; ScenGenerator produces task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment.

Result: The framework synthesized 191 environments and ~7K scenarios, which when used for SFT and RL training of Qwen3 models, significantly improved LLMs' ability to solve complex multi-turn, multi-tool interaction tasks across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: EnvScaler provides an automated, scalable solution for creating tool-interaction environments that effectively improves LLM agent capabilities, with code and data publicly released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to be trained to act as agents in various real-world environments, but this process relies on rich and varied tool-interaction sandboxes. However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions. We release our code and data at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/EnvScaler.

Motivation: Early-stage researchers need help effectively communicating scientific findings to the public. Existing general-purpose LLMs are not optimally aligned for this specific science communication task.

Method: Proposed a framework for training LLMs to emulate science journalists. Evaluated trained LLM journalists through conversations with both simulated and human researchers, comparing them to general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: The scientific community needs tools that help early-stage researchers effectively communicate their findings and innovations to the public. Although existing general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in this endeavor, they are not optimally aligned for it. To address this, we propose a framework for training LLMs to emulate the role of a science journalist that can be used by early-stage researchers to learn how to properly communicate their papers to the general public. We evaluate the usefulness of our trained LLM Journalists in leading conversations with both simulated and human researchers. %compared to the general-purpose ones. Our experiments indicate that LLMs trained using our framework ask more relevant questions that address the societal impact of research, prompting researchers to clarify and elaborate on their findings. In the user study, the majority of participants who interacted with our trained LLM Journalist appreciated it more than interacting with general-purpose LLMs.

*Molly Kennedy,Ali Parker,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic centrist framing bias in political summarization, with Grok 4 being most ideologically expressive while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 perform best at bias classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about political framing in LLM-generated journalism, where subtle wording choices can shape interpretation and potentially introduce systematic biases in news summaries.

Method: Tested nine state-of-the-art LLMs by comparing few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels, then generated "steered" summaries under FAITHFUL, CENTRIST, LEFT, and RIGHT prompts, scoring all outputs with a fixed ideology evaluator.

Result: Found pervasive ideological center-collapse in both article-level ratings and generated text, indicating systematic tendency toward centrist framing. Grok 4 was most ideologically expressive generator, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 achieved strongest bias-rating performance among commercial and open-weight models respectively.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit systematic centrist bias in political framing, raising concerns about their use in journalism where ideological neutrality or faithful representation may be compromised by this center-collapse tendency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based summarization and text generation are increasingly used for producing and rewriting text, raising concerns about political framing in journalism where subtle wording choices can shape interpretation. Across nine state-of-the-art LLMs, we study political framing by testing whether LLMs' classification-based bias signals align with framing behavior in their generated summaries. We first compare few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels. We then generate "steered" summaries under FAITHFUL, CENTRIST, LEFT, and RIGHT prompts, and score all outputs using a single fixed ideology evaluator. We find pervasive ideological center-collapse in both article-level ratings and generated text, indicating a systematic tendency toward centrist framing. Among evaluated models, Grok 4 is by far the most ideologically expressive generator, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 achieve the strongest bias-rating performance among commercial and open-weight models, respectively.

TL;DR: A semantic NLP pipeline transforms unstructured EHR notes into FHIR-compliant digital twin representations using NER, concept normalization, and relation extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital twins in healthcare face challenges due to variability in clinical documentation and lack of standardized mappings from unstructured EHRs, making interoperable patient digital twin generation difficult.

Method: A semantic NLP-driven pipeline with three main components: named entity recognition (NER) to extract clinical concepts, concept normalization to map entities to SNOMED-CT or ICD-10 standards, and relation extraction to capture structured associations between conditions, medications, and observations.

Result: Evaluation on MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo with validation against MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR reference mappings shows high F1-scores for entity and relation extraction, with improved schema completeness and interoperability compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully addresses the challenge of generating interoperable patient digital twins from unstructured EHRs by transforming free-text notes into standardized FHIR-compliant representations.

Abstract: Digital twins -- virtual replicas of physical entities -- are gaining traction in healthcare for personalized monitoring, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support. However, generating interoperable patient digital twins from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs) remains challenging due to variability in clinical documentation and lack of standardized mappings. This paper presents a semantic NLP-driven pipeline that transforms free-text EHR notes into FHIR-compliant digital twin representations. The pipeline leverages named entity recognition (NER) to extract clinical concepts, concept normalization to map entities to SNOMED-CT or ICD-10, and relation extraction to capture structured associations between conditions, medications, and observations. Evaluation on MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo with validation against MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR reference mappings demonstrates high F1-scores for entity and relation extraction, with improved schema completeness and interoperability compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: MAC (Multimodal Auto-Completion) predicts upcoming text using both typed text and visual context, outperforming text-only methods in user satisfaction while Router-Suggest framework provides efficient VLM selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-only auto-completion fails to leverage visual context in multimodal applications like digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations where users share visual information.

Method: Introduce MAC task, create benchmark datasets from MMDialog and ImageChat, evaluate VLMs vs textual baselines, propose Router-Suggest framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context.

Result: VLMs significantly outperform textual models in user satisfaction, saving typing effort and improving completion quality; Router-Suggest achieves 2.3x to 10x speedup over best-performing VLM while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Multimodal context is essential for effective auto-completion, enabling smarter, user-aware assistants; Router-Suggest provides practical solution balancing accuracy and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show competitive zero-shot multilingual MT performance and preference optimization improves it further, the order of training data samples (curriculum learning) remains underexplored for boosting MT performance.

Method: Introduces CLewR (Curriculum Learning with Restarts) - a novel curriculum learning strategy that reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. Integrates this with various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates consistent performance gains across multiple model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and various preference optimization techniques.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning with restarts effectively improves multilingual machine translation performance when integrated with preference optimization, addressing the underexplored aspect of training data ordering.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance in zero-shot multilingual machine translation (MT). Some follow-up works further improved MT performance via preference optimization, but they leave a key aspect largely underexplored: the order in which data samples are given during training. We address this topic by integrating curriculum learning into various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms to boost MT performance. We introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. We demonstrate consistent gains across several model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current automatic interpreting quality metrics fail to account for communicative context and are insufficient for authentic practice evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rapid growth of interpreting technologies (remote, computer-aided, automated speech translation, avatars), there's high demand for quick, efficient quality measurement methods.

Method: Examines recently-proposed automated quality measurement methods and evaluates their suitability for authentic interpreting practice (both human and machine).

Result: Automatic metrics as currently proposed cannot account for communicative context and are not viable as standalone measures of interpreting quality.

Conclusion: Context is fundamental to interpreting quality analysis; current automated metrics alone are insufficient for evaluating authentic interpreting practice.

Abstract: With the growth of interpreting technologies, from remote interpreting and Computer-Aided Interpreting to automated speech translation and interpreting avatars, there is now a high demand for ways to quickly and efficiently measure the quality of any interpreting delivered. A range of approaches to fulfil the need for quick and efficient quality measurement have been proposed, each involving some measure of automation. This article examines these recently-proposed quality measurement methods and will discuss their suitability for measuring the quality of authentic interpreting practice, whether delivered by humans or machines, concluding that automatic metrics as currently proposed cannot take into account the communicative context and thus are not viable measures of the quality of any interpreting provision when used on their own. Across all attempts to measure or even categorise quality in Interpreting Studies, the contexts in which interpreting takes place have become fundamental to the final analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTUM is a framework that uses mechanistic analysis of attention and FFN pathways to detect citation hallucinations in RAG models, revealing that correct citation signatures evolve with model scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to citation hallucinations in RAG models oversimplify the problem as mere over-reliance on parametric knowledge, failing to capture the complex interplay of internal mechanisms that actually determine citation trustworthiness.

Method: FACTUM introduces four mechanistic scores that measure distinct contributions of attention and FFN pathways, and their alignment. It analyzes pathway contributions and attention sink usage to identify signatures of correct citations.

Result: FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. The research reveals that correct citation signatures are not static but evolve with model scale - smaller models show higher pathway alignment while larger models show lower alignment with more orthogonal information.

Conclusion: Citation hallucination should be reframed as a complex, scale-dependent interplay between internal mechanisms rather than simple over-reliance on parametric knowledge. FACTUM provides a more nuanced approach for building reliable RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are critically undermined by citation hallucinations, a deceptive failure where a model confidently cites a source that fails to support its claim. Existing work often attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on the model's parametric knowledge. We challenge this view and introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores measuring the distinct contributions of a model's attention and FFN pathways, and the alignment between them. Our analysis reveals two consistent signatures of correct citation: a significantly stronger contribution from the model's parametric knowledge and greater use of the attention sink for information synthesis. Crucially, we find the signature of a correct citation is not static but evolves with model scale. For example, the signature of a correct citation for the Llama-3.2-3B model is marked by higher pathway alignment, whereas for the Llama-3.1-8B model, it is characterized by lower alignment, where pathways contribute more distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex, evolving signature, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our findings reframe citation hallucination as a complex, scale-dependent interplay between internal mechanisms, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge when adapting large language models (LLMs) to create small language models (SLMs) for low-resource languages, causing the model to lose previously learned knowledge.

Method: Uses continual learning strategy with parts-of-speech (POS)-based code-switching combined with a replay adapter approach to preserve knowledge while adapting LLMs to SLMs for low-resource languages.

Result: Experiments on vision-language tasks (visual question answering) and language modeling tasks demonstrate the success of the proposed architecture in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed POS-based code-switching with replay adapter effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting when building SLMs from LLMs for multilingual scenarios, particularly benefiting low-resource languages.

Abstract: Modelling a language model for a multi-lingual scenario includes several potential challenges, among which catastrophic forgetting is the major challenge. For example, small language models (SLM) built for low-resource languages by adapting large language models (LLMs) pose the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. This work proposes to employ a continual learning strategy using parts-of-speech (POS)-based code-switching along with a replay adapter strategy to mitigate the identified gap of catastrophic forgetting while training SLM from LLM. Experiments conducted on vision language tasks such as visual question answering and language modelling task exhibits the success of the proposed architecture.

TL;DR: iReasoner is a self-evolving framework that improves multimodal models' reasoning by rewarding internal agreement in chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving +2.1 points improvement on benchmarks without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-evolving frameworks for large multimodal models mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making.

Method: Proposer-Solver loop over unlabeled images that augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with trajectory-aware signals over intermediate reasoning steps, using chain-of-thought elicitation and internal agreement rewards.

Result: Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to +2.1 points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training.

Conclusion: This work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings, demonstrating the value of rewarding internal reasoning consistency.

Abstract: Recent work shows that large multimodal models (LMMs) can self-improve from unlabeled data via self-play and intrinsic feedback. Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.

### [45] [Gender Bias in LLMs: Preliminary Evidence from Shared Parenting Scenario in Czech Family Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05879)
*Jakub Harasta,Matej Vasina,Martin Kornel,Tomas Foltynek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show gender bias in legal advice for divorce scenarios, with different models displaying varying patterns in parenting time recommendations based on gender of parties involved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As laypeople increasingly use LLMs for legal self-help, there's concern about potential gender bias in their responses to sensitive legal scenarios like family law cases, which could lead to unfair outcomes based on incomplete or biased outputs.

Method: Researchers created an expert-designed divorce scenario based on Czech family law, testing four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Llama 3.3) in zero-shot interactions. They used two versions of the scenario (gendered names vs. neutral labels) and introduced nine legally relevant factors to test how variations affect proposed shared-parenting ratios.

Result: Preliminary results show differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in outcomes generated by some systems, indicating systematic asymmetries in how LLMs handle legal scenarios based on gender.

Conclusion: The study highlights risks of laypeople relying on LLMs for legal guidance and emphasizes the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts, presenting exploratory evidence of systematic gender biases rather than establishing causal effects.

Abstract: Access to justice remains limited for many people, leading laypersons to increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal self-help. Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts. We present exploratory and descriptive evidence intended to identify systematic asymmetries rather than to establish causal effects.

*Constantinos Karouzos,Xingwei Tan,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic study shows preference-tuning suffers domain shift degradation, but pseudo-labeling adaptation strategies can substantially mitigate this problem across different alignment objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference tuning improves language models for human judgments but degrades performance outside training domains. The paper aims to systematically study alignment generalization under domain shift and explore adaptation strategies to mitigate this degradation.

Method: Comprehensive study comparing five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies (target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling) across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks to evaluate generalization under domain shift.

Result: Reveals systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift. Shows that adaptation strategies based on pseudo-labeling can substantially reduce domain-shift degradation.

Conclusion: Domain shift is a significant challenge for preference-tuned models, but pseudo-labeling adaptation strategies offer effective mitigation, with different alignment objectives showing varying generalization capabilities across domains.

Abstract: Preference tuning aligns pretrained language models to human judgments of quality, helpfulness, or safety by optimizing over explicit preference signals rather than likelihood alone. Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain. However, the extent to which adaptation strategies mitigate this domain shift remains unexplored. We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift. We show that adaptation strategies based on pseudo-labeling can substantially reduce domain-shift degradation

### [47] [HAPS: Hierarchical LLM Routing with Joint Architecture and Parameter Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05903)
*Zihang Tian,Rui Li,Jingsen Zhang,Xiaohe Bo,Wei Huo,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAPS is a hierarchical LLM routing framework that jointly searches over both model architectures and parameters, outperforming existing routing methods that only focus on architecture selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routing approaches typically focus only on selecting LLM architectures while overlooking parameter settings, which are critical for task performance. There's a need for a framework that can jointly optimize both architecture and parameter selection.

Method: HAPS uses a hierarchical routing framework with two levels: a high-level router selects among candidate LLM architectures, and a low-level router searches for optimal parameters for the selected architecture. A parameter generation network shares parameters between routers to mutually enhance capabilities, and a reward-augmented objective optimizes the framework during training.

Result: Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that HAPS consistently outperforms strong routing baselines.

Conclusion: HAPS demonstrates the importance of jointly optimizing both architecture and parameter selection in LLM routing, providing a more comprehensive approach that improves performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routing aims to exploit the specialized strengths of different LLMs for diverse tasks. However, existing approaches typically focus on selecting LLM architectures while overlooking parameter settings, which are critical for task performance. In this paper, we introduce HAPS, a hierarchical LLM routing framework that jointly searches over model architectures and parameters. Specifically, we use a high-level router to select among candidate LLM architectures, and then search for the optimal parameters for the selected architectures based on a low-level router. We design a parameter generation network to share parameters between the two routers to mutually enhance their capabilities. In the training process, we design a reward-augmented objective to effectively optimize our framework. Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that HAPS consistently outperforms strong routing baselines. We have released our code at https://github.com/zihangtian/HAPS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB) to measure belief robustness in LLMs, showing even self-consistent facts collapse under contextual interference, and introduces Structure-Aware Training to reduce knowledge brittleness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations rely on point-wise confidence metrics like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle beliefs. Real-world deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations, but existing methods fail to capture structural belief robustness.

Method: 1) Proposes Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB) - a structural measure evaluating response coherence across conceptual neighborhoods. 2) Introduces cognitive stress-testing protocol to probe output stability under contextual interference. 3) Develops Structure-Aware Training (SAT) to optimize context-invariant belief structure.

Result: Experiments show: 1) Even facts with perfect self-consistency rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. 2) High-NCB data is more resistant to interference. 3) SAT reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Conclusion: NCB provides a better measure of belief robustness than point-wise confidence metrics. Structure-Aware Training effectively reduces knowledge brittleness in LLMs, making them more reliable for real-world deployment under contextual perturbations.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pantagruel is a new family of self-supervised encoder models for French text and speech that learns contextualized target representations in feature space rather than predicting modality-specific tokens, achieving competitive performance across French benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective self-supervised models for French that can handle both text and speech modalities with a shared architecture, addressing the need for robust French representation learning that captures both linguistic and acoustic regularities.

Method: Pantagruel learns contextualized target representations in feature space instead of predicting modality-tailored targets like textual tokens or speech units. Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora: Wikipedia, OSCAR, CroissantLLM for text, and MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k (new 100k-hour French audio corpus from INA archives) for speech.

Result: Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines (CamemBERT, FlauBERT, LeBenchmark2.0) across a broad range of downstream tasks from standard French benchmarks like FLUE and LeBenchmark, while maintaining a shared architecture that handles both speech and text inputs.

Conclusion: The results confirm the effectiveness of feature-space self-supervised objectives for French representation learning and highlight Pantagruel as a robust foundation for multimodal speech-text understanding in French.

Abstract: We release Pantagruel models, a new family of self-supervised encoder models for French text and speech. Instead of predicting modality-tailored targets such as textual tokens or speech units, Pantagruel learns contextualized target representations in the feature space, allowing modality-specific encoders to capture linguistic and acoustic regularities more effectively. Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora, including Wikipedia, OSCAR and CroissantLLM for text, together with MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k for speech. INA-100k is a newly introduced 100,000-hour corpus of French audio derived from the archives of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), the national repository of French radio and television broadcasts, providing highly diverse audio data. We evaluate Pantagruel across a broad range of downstream tasks spanning both modalities, including those from the standard French benchmarks such as FLUE or LeBenchmark. Across these tasks, Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines such as CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and LeBenchmark2.0, while maintaining a shared architecture that can seamlessly handle either speech or text inputs. These results confirm the effectiveness of feature-space self-supervised objectives for French representation learning and highlight Pantagruel as a robust foundation for multimodal speech-text understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based predictive reasoning accelerates autonomous ML agents by replacing expensive physical execution with learned execution priors, achieving 6x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous ML agents are limited by the Generate-Execute-Feedback paradigm where hypothesis evaluation requires costly physical execution, creating an Execution Bottleneck that slows down scientific discovery.

Method: Proposes internalizing execution priors using World Models inspiration, formalizes Data-centric Solution Preference task, creates corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons, and develops FOREAGENT with Predict-then-Verify loop using Verified Data Analysis Reports.

Result: LLMs achieve 61.5% accuracy with robust confidence calibration when primed with Verified Data Analysis Reports. FOREAGENT achieves 6x acceleration in convergence and surpasses execution-based baselines by +6%.

Conclusion: Predictive reasoning can effectively bypass physical execution constraints in autonomous ML agents, significantly accelerating scientific discovery while maintaining or improving performance over traditional execution-based approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous machine learning agents have revolutionized scientific discovery, yet they remain constrained by a Generate-Execute-Feedback paradigm. Previous approaches suffer from a severe Execution Bottleneck, as hypothesis evaluation relies strictly on expensive physical execution. To bypass these physical constraints, we internalize execution priors to substitute costly runtime checks with instantaneous predictive reasoning, drawing inspiration from World Models. In this work, we formalize the task of Data-centric Solution Preference and construct a comprehensive corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant predictive capabilities when primed with a Verified Data Analysis Report, achieving 61.5% accuracy and robust confidence calibration. Finally, we instantiate this framework in FOREAGENT, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop, achieving a 6x acceleration in convergence while surpassing execution-based baselines by +6%. Our code and dataset will be publicly available soon at https://github.com/zjunlp/predict-before-execute.

TL;DR: A framework that amortizes inference-time reasoning costs by converting transient critiques into retrievable guidelines using file-based memory and agent-controlled tools, evaluated on rubric-based learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high computational cost of inference-time reasoning and refinement in LLMs while maintaining performance, by making critiques reusable rather than transient.

Method: Uses a file-based memory system and agent-controlled tool calls to convert transient critiques into retrievable guidelines that can be reused across multiple inference tasks.

Result: The augmented LLMs rapidly match the performance of test-time refinement pipelines while drastically reducing inference cost, as demonstrated on the Rubric Feedback Bench dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully amortizes reasoning costs by making critiques persistent and retrievable, offering an efficient alternative to expensive test-time refinement while maintaining comparable performance.

Abstract: We propose a framework that amortizes the cost of inference-time reasoning by converting transient critiques into retrievable guidelines, through a file-based memory system and agent-controlled tool calls. We evaluate this method on the Rubric Feedback Bench, a novel dataset for rubric-based learning. Experiments demonstrate that our augmented LLMs rapidly match the performance of test-time refinement pipelines while drastically reducing inference cost.

TL;DR: The paper proposes that effective Long CoT reasoning requires stable molecular-like structures formed by three interaction types, and introduces Mole-Syn to synthesize such structures for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought reasoning from imitation learning, so the authors aim to understand what makes Long CoT trajectories learnable and effective.

Method: Analyze distilled trajectories to identify molecular-like structures with three interaction types (Deep-Reasoning, Self-Reflection, Self-Exploration), introduce Effective Semantic Isomers concept, and develop Mole-Syn distribution-transfer-graph method to synthesize effective Long CoT structures.

Result: Analysis shows stable molecular structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. Only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable learning. Mole-Syn boosts performance and RL stability across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective Long CoT reasoning requires stable molecular-like structures, and Mole-Syn successfully synthesizes these structures to improve LLM performance and training stability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.

*Elias Lumer,Faheem Nizar,Akshaya Jangiti,Kevin Frank,Anmol Gulati,Mandar Phadate,Vamse Kumar Subbiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt caching reduces LLM agent costs by 45-80% and improves latency by 13-31% across major providers, with strategic cache control outperforming naive full-context caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce costs and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads (multi-turn tasks with extensive tool calling) remain underexplored, with no prior work quantifying savings or comparing caching strategies for such tasks.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) comparing three caching strategies: full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. Evaluation conducted on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring API cost and time to first token across 500+ agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts.

Result: Prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. Strategic cache block control (placing dynamic content at end of system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, excluding dynamic tool results) provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers.

Conclusion: Prompt caching offers substantial cost and latency benefits for agentic workloads, but strategic implementation is crucial. The paper provides practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems based on provider-specific nuances and optimal cache control strategies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have enabled complex multi-turn agentic tasks requiring extensive tool calling, where conversations can span dozens of API calls with increasingly large context windows. However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CaRR introduces fine-grained citation-aware rubric rewards for deep search agents to improve reasoning comprehensiveness and factual grounding, combined with C-GRPO policy optimization that outperforms standard RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for LLM-based deep search agents rely on binary outcome rewards that fail to capture reasoning comprehensiveness and factuality, leading to shortcut exploitation and hallucinations.

Method: Proposes Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR) that decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics requiring agents to identify hidden entities, provide correct citations, and construct complete evidence chains. Also introduces Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) combining CaRR with outcome rewards.

Result: C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks, effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks.

Conclusion: CaRR and C-GRPO provide an effective framework for training robust deep search agents with improved reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity compared to binary reward approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing LLM-based deep search agents. However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constructing complete evidence chains that link to the predicted answer. We further introduce \textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks.

*Chengming Cui,Tianxin Wei,Ziyi Chen,Ruizhong Qiu,Zhichen Zeng,Zhining Liu,Xuying Ning,Duo Zhou,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaFuse is an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects fusion units during generation, outperforming fixed-granularity ensemble methods by 6.88% on average across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ensemble approaches for LLMs use fixed fusion granularity, which lacks flexibility for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: AdaFuse dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation using an uncertainty-based criterion. It adjusts fusion behavior on-the-fly based on decoding context, with words as basic building blocks. In uncertain states, it invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations.

Result: Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation show AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

Conclusion: AdaFuse establishes synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration and resulting diversity strengthens ensemble quality, providing a more flexible and effective inference-time ensemble approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BFD framework disentangles attention into position and content factors, revealing that content dominates attention, DINOv2 uses richer content-position coupling, and attention heads specialize in different interaction types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attention maps show where attention focuses but don't reveal what information (position vs. content) is actually being exchanged between tokens. There's a need to understand the fundamental mechanisms of how attention mediates communication in Vision Transformers.

Method: Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD): 1) ANOVA-based decomposition disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; 2) SVD of query-key interaction matrix QK^T reveals bi-orthogonal modes showing how these factors mediate communication.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Attention operates primarily through content (content-content interactions dominate), with DINOv2 showing richer content-position coupling; 2) Attention heads specialize into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators; 3) DINOv2's superior shape processing comes from intermediate layers preserving positional structure while enriching semantic content.

Conclusion: BFD provides a principled framework to understand what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens, revealing that content dominates attention, heads specialize in different interaction types, and DINOv2's success comes from balanced position-content integration.

Abstract: Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.
  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.

*Sagi Eppel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can generate code to simulate complex systems from images but struggle with fine details, showing an asymmetry between high-level understanding and low-level perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) can construct mental models of real-world systems depicted in images, similar to human understanding, by testing their ability to recognize and simulate these systems through code generation.

Method: Im2Sim methodology: VLMs analyze natural images of real-world systems, describe them, and write generative code to simulate them. The synthetic images produced by executing this code are then compared against the original images to evaluate understanding.

Result: Leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple abstraction layers and diverse domains (physical systems, vegetation, cities, materials, geology). However, they show limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level pattern arrangements.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit an interesting asymmetry: they combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details, revealing both capabilities and limitations in their ability to construct mental models of depicted systems.

Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.

Result: STResNetMilli achieves 70.0% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 3M parameters, outperforming MobileNetV1 and ShuffleNetV2. STYOLOMicro and STYOLOMilli achieve 30.5% and 33.6% mAP on MS COCO, surpassing YOLOv5n and YOLOX Nano in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed STResNet and STYOLO families provide superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for edge deployment, enabling better performance on resource-constrained platforms without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in lightweight neural networks have significantly improved the efficiency of deploying deep learning models on edge hardware. However, most existing architectures still trade accuracy for latency, which limits their applicability on microcontroller and neural processing unit based devices. In this work, we introduce two new model families, STResNet for image classification and STYOLO for object detection, jointly optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint on resource constrained platforms. The proposed STResNet series, ranging from Nano to Tiny variants, achieves competitive ImageNet 1K accuracy within a four million parameter budget. Specifically, STResNetMilli attains 70.0 percent Top 1 accuracy with only three million parameters, outperforming MobileNetV1 and ShuffleNetV2 at comparable computational complexity. For object detection, STYOLOMicro and STYOLOMilli achieve 30.5 percent and 33.6 percent mean average precision, respectively, on the MS COCO dataset, surpassing YOLOv5n and YOLOX Nano in both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, when STResNetMilli is used as a backbone with the Ultralytics training environment.

### [59] [MOSAIC-GS: Monocular Scene Reconstruction via Advanced Initialization for Complex Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05368)
*Svitlana Morkva,Maximum Wilder-Smith,Michael Oechsle,Alessio Tonioni,Marco Hutter,Vaishakh Patil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSAIC-GS is a fast, explicit Gaussian Splatting method for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using geometric cues and efficient motion encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular reconstruction is ill-posed due to lack of multiview constraints, making accurate geometry and temporal coherence recovery challenging. Existing methods struggle with motion inference from visual appearance alone in monocular settings.

Method: Uses multiple geometric cues (depth, optical flow, segmentation, point tracking) with rigidity constraints to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics. Decomposes scene into static/dynamic components. Dynamic Gaussians use time-dependent Poly-Fourier curves for parameter-efficient motion encoding.

Result: Achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOSAIC-GS provides an efficient, explicit approach for monocular dynamic scene reconstruction that leverages geometric cues to overcome ill-posedness and enables real-time rendering with compact representations.

Abstract: We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.

*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeLDR introduces quaternion block-circulant layers that combine quaternion channel mixing with structured matrices for efficient edge deployment, achieving significant compression with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is limited by memory traffic and compute cost of dense linear operators. Quaternion networks improve parameter efficiency but retain unstructured weights, while structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in real domain only.

Method: EdgeLDR framework introduces quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combine quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure, enabling FFT-based evaluation through complex adjoint representation with reference implementations.

Result: FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over naive implementation and stable latency as block size increases. Integration into CNN and Transformer backbones shows significant compression with competitive accuracy on RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification tasks.

Conclusion: EdgeLDR layers provide a practical framework for efficient edge deployment by combining quaternion parameter efficiency with structured matrix computation, enabling larger compression factors while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is often limited by the memory traffic and compute cost of dense linear operators. While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency. The results show that EdgeLDR layers provide significant compression with competitive accuracy.

*Yuang Shi,Simone Gasparini,Géraldine Morin,Wei Tsang Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid Gaussian representation method that separates 3D Gaussians into Sketch (high-frequency edges) and Patch (low-frequency regions) categories for efficient progressive streaming and rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices by creating a structure-aware representation that mimics traditional artistic techniques.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical adaptive categorization framework using multi-criteria density-based clustering and adaptive quality-driven refinement on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating dependency on external 3D line primitives.

Result: Achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, maintains visual quality with only 0.5% of original model size.

Conclusion: The semantic separation of Gaussians into Sketch and Patch categories enables layered progressive streaming and efficient representation, making high-fidelity 3D content accessible on resource-limited devices and networks.

Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning BiomedCLIP with multi-task learning improves chest X-ray image-text retrieval by incorporating clinical abnormality classification and contrastive learning for better diagnostic sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP and BiomedCLIP provide strong cross-modal embeddings but aren't optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks like retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray image queries.

Method: Multi-task learning framework fine-tuning BiomedCLIP with lightweight MLP projector head trained with composite loss: binary cross-entropy for normal/abnormal classification, supervised contrastive loss for intra-class consistency, and CLIP loss for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP. t-SNE visualizations show clearer semantic clustering of normal/abnormal cases.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive, multi-task learning is valuable for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications, enhancing diagnostic sensitivity and clinical relevance.

Abstract: CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large vision-language models for geolocalization overlook the human strategy of using maps, which is crucial for accurate location prediction.

Method: Two-stage optimization: 1) Agentic reinforcement learning to improve sampling efficiency, and 2) Parallel test-time scaling to explore multiple candidate paths before final prediction. Formulated as an agent-in-the-map loop.

Result: Outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, improving Acc@500m from 8.0% to 22.1% compared to Gemini-3-Pro with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

Conclusion: The "Thinking with Map" approach with agent-in-the-map loops and two-stage optimization significantly advances image geolocalization capabilities, demonstrating the importance of incorporating map-based reasoning.

Abstract: The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

TL;DR: TAPM-Net: A trajectory-aware Mamba network that models spatial diffusion of target-induced feature perturbations for improved infrared small target detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN and ViT models lack mechanisms to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in feature space, which is essential for distinguishing signals from structured noise in infrared scenes.

Method: Proposes Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network with two components: Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) constructs perturbation energy fields and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories; Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB) uses Mamba-based state-space to model dynamic propagation along trajectories with velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K datasets for infrared small target detection.

Conclusion: TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost, outperforming existing attention-based methods.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.

*Tingwei Xie,Jinxin He,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROAP is a lightweight pipeline that improves Layout Transformers for document understanding by modeling reading order and reducing visual noise, without modifying pre-trained backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Transformers for visually-rich document understanding have two key limitations: lack of explicit modeling for logical reading order, and interference from visual tokens that dilutes attention on textual semantics.

Method: ROAP uses: 1) Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to extract hierarchical reading sequences from complex layouts, 2) Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB) to integrate sequences into attention, and 3) Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) to suppress visual noise and enhance text-text interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on FUNSD and CORD benchmarks show ROAP consistently improves performance of representative backbones like LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling reading logic and regulating modality interference are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis.

Abstract: The efficacy of Multimodal Transformers in visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) is critically constrained by two inherent limitations: the lack of explicit modeling for logical reading order and the interference of visual tokens that dilutes attention on textual semantics.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ROAP, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic pipeline designed to optimize attention distributions in Layout Transformers without altering their pre-trained backbones.
  The proposed pipeline first employs an Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to robustly extract hierarchical reading sequences from complex layouts. These sequences are then integrated into the attention mechanism via a Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB). Furthermore, a Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) is introduced to adaptively suppress visual noise and enhance fine-grained text-text interactions.
  Extensive experiments on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks demonstrate that ROAP consistently improves the performance of representative backbones, including LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.
  These findings confirm that explicitly modeling reading logic and regulating modality interference are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/ROAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate imaging of plant roots in subterranean environments is challenging due to occlusion, varying soil moisture, and low contrast, limiting conventional vision-based approaches for studying soil-plant interactions and nutrient uptake.

Method: Proposes an underground imaging system capturing multiple overlapping views of roots, integrated with a deep learning-based MISR framework that leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images. Uses a synthetic dataset simulating realistic underground imaging scenarios with environmental factors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines with 2.3% reduction in BRISQUE (improved image quality) while maintaining same CLIP-IQA score. Enables enhanced phenotypic analysis and accurate estimation of root traits like root hair count and density.

Conclusion: The framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification, facilitating agricultural and ecological research through improved root system analysis.

Abstract: Understanding plant root systems is critical for advancing research in soil-plant interactions, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gray matter loss patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, particularly in medial temporal structures, and to examine the predictive value of hippocampal volume for disease progression and genetic influences.

Method: Used CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry on baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (90 controls, 129 MCI, 30 AD). Analyzed gray matter volume with general linear model, diagnostic group as primary predictor, age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps thresholded at p<0.001 (voxelwise) with FWE cluster-level correction (p<0.05).

Result: Significant hippocampal atrophy in AD vs CN (Cohen's d=2.03) and AD vs MCI (Cohen's d=1.61). Hippocampal volume showed moderate predictive value for MCI-to-AD conversion (AUC=0.66). No significant APOE4 genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume.

Conclusion: Medial temporal degeneration is a key feature of AD progression. Hippocampal volume has moderate predictive value for disease conversion, but APOE4 status doesn't significantly affect cross-sectional hippocampal volume measurements.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with progressive gray matter loss, particularly in medial temporal structures. In this study, CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry was applied to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (CN = 90, MCI = 129, AD = 30). Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively). Hippocampal volume demonstrated moderate predictive value for conversion from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.66). Stratification by APOE4 status did not reveal significant genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume. These results support medial temporal degeneration as a key feature of AD progression and provide insights into predictive biomarkers and genetic influences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos (minutes to hours) challenge current MLLMs due to complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies. Direct encoding is computationally expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion leads to redundant or fragmented content.

Conclusion: MMViR provides an effective structured representation for long video understanding that balances computational efficiency with comprehensive content representation, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Long videos, ranging from minutes to hours, present significant challenges for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies. Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding.

Motivation: Breast ultrasound imaging faces challenges in tumor segmentation and classification due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology, requiring improved methods for accurate diagnosis.

Method: Prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation of SAM vision encoder features decoded through lightweight convolutional head or UNet-inspired decoder for segmentation, with classification enhanced via mask-guided attention to focus on lesion-relevant features.

Result: Achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.887 and classification accuracy of 92.3% on PRECISE 2025 dataset, ranking among top entries on the challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: SAM-based representations combined with segmentation-guided learning significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging remain challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology. This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder. Unlike prompt-based SAM variants, our approach employs a prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation where high-dimensional SAM features are decoded through either a lightweight convolutional head or a UNet-inspired decoder for pixel-wise segmentation. The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard. These results demonstrate that SAM-based representations, when coupled with segmentation-guided learning, significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

*Fuwen Luo,Zihao Wan,Ziyue Wang,Yaluo Liu,Pau Tong Lin Xu,Xuanjia Qiao,Xiaolong Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieroSA enables MLLMs to automatically extract stroke-level structures from character images without manual annotation, providing cross-lingual structural analysis of logographic writing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and MLLMs fail to capture the structural logic of character strokes in hieroglyphic writing systems. They process characters either as textual tokens (LLMs) or raw pixel grids (MLLMs), missing the underlying stroke composition. Existing structural analysis methods are script-specific and require labor-intensive manual work.

Method: Proposes Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a generalizable framework that transforms character bitmaps into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in normalized coordinate space. It enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures without handcrafted data, allowing for cross-lingual generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. The framework successfully analyzes both modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphic characters.

Conclusion: HieroSA serves as a powerful graphematics analysis tool for deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts, enabling structural analysis without manual annotation and facilitating cross-lingual generalization in character analysis.

Abstract: Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. Experimental results highlight the potential of our work as a graphematics analysis tool for a deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts. View our code at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/HieroSA.

TL;DR: GaussianSwap is a video face swapping framework that creates 3D Gaussian Splatting avatars from target videos while transferring identity from source images, enabling interactive manipulation and animation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video face swapping frameworks are limited to pixel-based representations that lack animation or interactive manipulation capabilities. The authors aim to shift from pixel-based video generation to creating high-fidelity avatars with swapped faces that can be dynamically controlled.

Method: The framework preprocesses target videos to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses, and segmentation masks. It rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames for dynamic facial control. For identity preservation, it uses a compound identity embedding from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, it renders the face-swapped avatar on background frames.

Result: Experimental results show that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity, and temporal consistency compared to conventional methods, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

Conclusion: GaussianSwap represents a paradigm shift from pixel-based video face swapping to creating interactive 3D avatars with swapped identities, offering improved quality and new interactive capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

Conclusion: SAS-VPReID effectively addresses extreme far-distance VPReID challenges through scale adaptation and shape priors, producing more discriminative feature representations.

Abstract: Video-based Person Re-IDentification (VPReID) aims to retrieve the same person from videos captured by non-overlapping cameras. At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise. To address these issues, we propose a Scale-Adaptive framework with Shape Priors for VPReID, named SAS-VPReID. The framework is built upon three complementary modules. First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations. Experiments on the VReID-XFD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and our final framework ranks the first on the VReID-XFD challenge leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIFF-MF is a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion that addresses the trade-off between preserving infrared intensity and visible details by using feature discrepancy maps to guide fusion across both channel and spatial dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state space model approaches for multi-modal image fusion tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. There's a need for a method that can effectively balance and integrate complementary information from multiple source images.

Method: DIFF-MF uses feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a two-dimensional fusion process: 1) Channel dimension: channel-exchange module with cross-attention dual state space modeling for adaptive feature reweighting, 2) Spatial dimension: spatial-exchange module with cross-modal state space scanning for comprehensive spatial fusion. The approach maintains linear computational complexity while capturing global dependencies.

Result: Experimental results on driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that DIFF-MF outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation, effectively integrating complementary multi-modal features.

Conclusion: DIFF-MF successfully addresses the limitations of existing state space models for multi-modal image fusion by leveraging feature discrepancy maps and dual-dimensional fusion, achieving superior performance in balancing infrared intensity preservation and visible detail retention while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images to produce high-quality fused images with enriched content. Although existing approaches based on state space model have achieved satisfied performance with high computational efficiency, they tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or conversely, preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.

TL;DR: MoGen is a user-friendly multi-object image generation method that uses Regional Semantic Anchoring and Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance to achieve precise object quantity alignment and flexible fine-grained control without rigid input formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object image generation methods struggle with precise alignment between language descriptions and image regions, leading to inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. Current approaches rely heavily on external control signals, making input formats rigid and incompatible with diverse user needs and resource conditions.

Method: MoGen introduces two key modules: 1) Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to corresponding image regions during generation, ensuring quantity consistency. 2) Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module that adaptively parses and integrates various multi-source control signals to formulate structured intent for selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes.

Result: Experimental results show MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while demonstrating superior accessibility and control flexibility.

Conclusion: MoGen provides a user-friendly solution for multi-object image generation that achieves precise semantic-region alignment and flexible fine-grained control without rigid input dependencies, making it more accessible and adaptable to diverse user needs.

Abstract: Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from hallucinations where generated text deviates from visual content. Existing detection methods rely on output logits or external tools, overlooking internal mechanisms. The authors propose to investigate internal attention heads as they may carry primary signals for truthful generation.

Method: Proposes VIB-Probe framework based on Variational Information Bottleneck theory.

Conclusion: VIB-Probe provides an effective approach to hallucination detection and mitigation in Vision-Language Models by leveraging internal attention mechanisms through information bottleneck theory, offering superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniADet is a simple, parameter-efficient universal anomaly detection framework that decouples classification and segmentation tasks, requiring only 0.002M learnable parameters and outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 14 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual-language foundation model approaches for universal anomaly detection suffer from complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, limiting their flexibility and generality.

Method: The paper proposes decoupling classification and segmentation tasks, and decoupling cross-level features by learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features, completely eliminating the need for language encoder in anomaly detection.

Result: UniADet surpasses state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot methods by a large margin and even outperforms full-shot AD methods for the first time on 14 real-world benchmarks covering industrial and medical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed embarrassingly simple framework demonstrates that language encoder is unnecessary for universal anomaly detection, achieving superior performance with minimal parameters while maintaining high generality across different foundation models.

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression recognition is important for human-computer interaction, but labeled data is costly to acquire. Semi-supervised approaches that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data are needed to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm with: 1) Local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction to strengthen local feature representation while preventing overfitting; 2) Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) to adapt to semi-supervised learning requirements; 3) Selective Negative Learning (SNL) strategy that utilizes low-confidence unlabeled samples by mining useful expression information from complementary labels.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. The method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised approach with DTA and SNL effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled data for facial expression recognition, reducing annotation costs while achieving superior performance compared to fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

*Fanxiao Li,Jiaying Wu,Tingchao Fu,Dayang Li,Herun Wan,Wei Zhou,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers develop a pipeline to detect "interpretation drift" in social media news previews where selective omission of context leads readers to form judgments that diverge from full articles. They create the MM-Misleading benchmark, evaluate LVLMs, and propose OMGuard with fine-tuning and rationale-guided correction to improve detection and rewriting of misleading content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media news previews (image-headline pairs) can be factually correct but still misleading through selective omission of crucial context, causing "interpretation drift" where readers form judgments that diverge from the full article's message. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation and remains underexplored.

Method: Developed a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding to construct the MM-Misleading benchmark. Proposed OMGuard with two components: (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning to improve multimodal misleadingness detection, and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction that uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions.

Result: OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.

Conclusion: The research addresses the underexplored problem of covert misleadingness through omission in social media news previews. The proposed OMGuard framework effectively improves detection and correction of such content, demonstrating that multimodal approaches are essential for addressing interpretation drift, especially in image-driven scenarios where text-only methods fail.

Abstract: Even when factually correct, social-media news previews (image-headline pairs) can induce interpretation drift: by selectively omitting crucial context, they lead readers to form judgments that diverge from what the full article conveys. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.

Motivation: AI-generated images threaten online information authenticity. Current detection methods struggle to generalize to unseen generative models and can't adapt to rapidly evolving generation techniques, risking real-world ineffectiveness.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for transferable offline detection model; 2) Continual learning with data augmentation chain and K-FAC method to prevent catastrophic forgetting; 3) Linear interpolation based on Linear Mode Connectivity to capture commonalities across models.

Result: Offline detectors surpass leading baseline by +5.51% in mean average precision. Continual learning achieves 92.20% average accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Benchmark includes 27 generative models (GANs, deepfakes, diffusion models) up to August 2024.

Conclusion: The proposed continual learning framework effectively addresses the adaptability challenge in AI-generated image detection, maintaining strong performance as generative models evolve, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: The malicious misuse and widespread dissemination of AI-generated images pose a significant threat to the authenticity of online information. Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision. Our continual learning strategy achieves an average accuracy of 92.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GS-DMSR effectively addresses the trade-off between convergence rate and rendering quality in 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, particularly for complex dynamic motions, through adaptive optimization strategies and manifold enhancement techniques.

Abstract: In the field of 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, how to balance model convergence rate and rendering quality has long been a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed, particularly in high-precision modeling of scenes with complex dynamic motions. To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a data-driven metric to quantify shape-texture balance in datasets and introduces an efficient adaptation method using modified max-pooling dilation to improve CNN performance on shape-dominant data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs have inherent texture bias that works well for natural images but degrades performance on shape-dominant data like illustrations and sketches. Existing shape-biased models lack quantitative metrics to identify which datasets would benefit from such modifications.

Method: 1) Proposes a metric using SSIM between image luminance channels and L0-smoothed versions to quantify shape-texture balance. 2) Introduces computationally efficient adaptation method that modifies dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen, requiring only final classification layer training.

Result: The approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for adapting texture-biased CNNs to shape-dominant datasets through data-driven assessment and efficient architectural modification, especially valuable in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to exhibit a strong texture bias, favoring local patterns over global shape information--a tendency inherent to their convolutional architecture. While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.

TL;DR: SceneAlign uses scene graphs to create hard negative rationales for improving multimodal LLM reasoning faithfulness through targeted structural interventions and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, exhibiting hallucinations, mis-grounding, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches fail because models can exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding.

Method: SceneAlign leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. It identifies reasoning-critical nodes and perturbs them through four targeted strategies mimicking typical grounding failures, creating hard negative rationales that are linguistically plausible but visually inaccurate. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness.

Conclusion: SceneAlign demonstrates the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for improving multimodal reasoning by addressing visual grounding failures through structured interventions and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: RRS-Gait proposes a geometric transformation invariance framework for gait recognition, treating variations in gait conditions as combinations of Reflect, Rotate, and Scale transformations to achieve identity invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most gait recognition models implicitly learn common traits across different conditions, but few explicitly explore inherent relations between gait conditions. The paper aims to establish connections among different gait conditions by viewing variations as geometric transformations.

Method: Proposes RRS-Gait framework that explores three geometric transformations (Reflect, Rotate, Scale). It adjusts convolution kernels based on specific transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance, then feeds these equivariant-aware features into global pooling for invariance-aware learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling gait variations as geometric transformations and achieving geometric invariance, identity invariance naturally follows, providing a new perspective for gait recognition that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: The goal of gait recognition is to extract identity-invariant features of an individual under various gait conditions, e.g., cross-view and cross-clothing. Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\mathcal{R}$otate-$\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning. Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentVLA is a novel Vision-Language-Action framework that uses self-supervised latent action prediction to train autonomous driving models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while achieving state-of-the-art performance and real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving models struggle with rare, long-tail scenarios due to limited dataset diversity. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pre-trained knowledge to address this, they face three key challenges: numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction from discrete tokenization, heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and computational inefficiency from multi-step reasoning that hinders real-time deployment.

Method: LatentVLA employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations. It learns rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data and uses knowledge distillation to transfer the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks.

Result: LatentVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NAVSIM benchmark with a PDMS score of 92.4 and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on the nuScenes benchmark, while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: LatentVLA successfully addresses the limitations of traditional VLA models by eliminating language annotation dependency and linguistic bias while achieving both robust performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained on largescale datasets perform well in common scenarios but struggle with rare, long-tail situations due to limited scenario diversity. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage broad knowledge from pre-trained visionlanguage models to address this limitation, yet face critical challenges: (1) numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction due to discrete tokenization, (2) heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and (3) computational inefficiency from multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning hinders real-time deployment. We propose LatentVLA, a novel framework that employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while learning rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data. Through knowledge distillation, LatentVLA transfers the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks, achieving both robust performance and real-time efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning image compression models are complex, heavyweight, and require substantial resources, making them impractical for hardware-constrained applications.

Method: Uses simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate latent space of original models, creating lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones with less data and shorter training.

Result: Lightweight encoders preserve reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with original loss, evaluated across two different architectures.

Conclusion: Method enables practical deployment of image compression models in resource-limited environments by reducing encoder complexity while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models for image compression often face practical limitations in hardware-constrained applications. Although these models achieve high-quality reconstructions, they are typically complex, heavyweight, and require substantial training data and computational resources. We propose a methodology to partially compress these networks by reducing the size of their encoders. Our approach uses a simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate the latent space of the original models with less data and shorter training, yielding lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones. We evaluate the resulting lightweight encoders across two different architectures on the image compression task. Experiments show that our method preserves reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with the original loss, making it practical for resource-limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist Vision-Language Models lack specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time, struggling to establish structured spatial-temporal representations needed for safe trajectory planning in autonomous driving.

Method: SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition, providing structured spatial-temporal representation that integrates multi-level information into a compact format for trajectory planning.

Result: Extensive experiments on NAVSIM benchmark show SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS metrics.

Conclusion: Hierarchical knowledge structuring effectively adapts generalist VLMs to autonomous driving by providing the structured spatial-temporal representations they inherently lack.

Abstract: Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.

TL;DR: SketchVL is a multimodal LLM that uses drawing-based intermediate reasoning and FinePO RL algorithm for fine-grained credit assignment, achieving 7.23% average performance gain across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with chart understanding due to complex visual reasoning requirements. RL-trained MLLMs face credit assignment problems where trajectory-level advantage estimation cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single response.

Method: SketchVL draws intermediate reasoning steps as markers on images and feeds annotated images back to itself for multi-step reasoning. It uses FinePO RL algorithm with Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within trajectories for precise step-level credit assignment.

Result: SketchVL achieves 7.23% average performance gain over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics. The model learns to align step-level behavior with FinePRM's scoring.

Conclusion: SketchVL with FinePO provides a promising direction for training powerful reasoning models by enabling fine-grained credit assignment in RL optimization, addressing limitations of trajectory-level reward estimation in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.

Motivation: Direct application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to image-to-video (I2V) models fails to yield consistent reward improvements, despite GRPO's success in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

Method: TAGRPO uses a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, leveraging rollout videos from identical initial noise for better optimization guidance. It incorporates a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead.

Result: TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation, demonstrating better performance despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: TAGRPO provides an effective post-training framework for I2V models that addresses the limitations of direct GRPO application through contrastive learning principles and efficient rollout management.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of integrating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into flow matching models, particularly for text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.

Conclusion: Feature-embedded SLAM not only enables new downstream applications but also improves underlying tracking and mapping performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in tracking, depth, and RGB rendering while maintaining real-time operation.

Abstract: We present a real-time tracking SLAM system that unifies efficient camera tracking with photorealistic feature-enriched mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our main contribution is integrating dense feature rasterization into the novel-view synthesis, aligned with a visual foundation model. This yields strong semantics, going beyond basic RGB-D input, aiding both tracking and mapping accuracy. Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\% lower pose error and 8\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view multi-label learning suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations due to data acquisition challenges and expensive supervision costs. Existing methods have limitations in feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling.

Method: ADRL uses adaptive disentangled representation learning with: 1) robust view completion via feature-level affinity propagation across modalities with neighborhood awareness, 2) stochastic masking for reconstruction, 3) category-level association dissemination for label prototype learning, 4) mutual-information-based objective for representation consistency, 5) prototype-specific feature selection, and 6) pseudo-label generation with discriminative view fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate superior performance of ADRL compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ADRL effectively addresses the challenging problem of multi-view multi-label learning with feature absence and incomplete annotations through its adaptive disentangled representation learning framework, achieving robust performance across various applications.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.

TL;DR: Send-VAE is a semantic disentangled VAE that aligns with Vision Foundation Models' semantic hierarchy to improve attribute-level disentanglement, leading to faster training and better image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use the same alignment targets for both VAEs and LDMs, overlooking their different representational needs. LDMs need high-level semantic concepts, while VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement for structured attribute-level encoding.

Method: Proposes Send-VAE with a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs' semantic hierarchy to bridge attribute-level disentanglement with high-level semantics for effective VAE learning guidance.

Result: Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 (with CFG) and 1.75 (without CFG) on ImageNet 256x256 when training flow-based transformers SiTs. Semantic disentanglement correlates with improved generation performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing VAEs for semantic disentanglement through alignment with VFMs' semantic hierarchy leads to better representation learning, faster training, and superior image generation quality compared to using the same alignment targets for both VAEs and LDMs.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior surround-view depth estimation approaches focus mainly on photometric constraints, but few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view settings. The authors aim to leverage geometry consistency as the primary cue for more accurate depth estimation.

Method: 1) Uses foundation models as pseudo geometry priors to guide surface normal consistency in 3D space and regularize object/texture-consistent depth in 2D. 2) Introduces novel view synthesis pipeline with dense depth reconstruction via spatial warping for photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts. 3) Proposes adaptive joint motion learning strategy to emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the geometry coherence approach for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation, providing a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Goal Force is a video generation framework that uses force vectors and intermediate dynamics as goal specifications, enabling physics-aware planning without external simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation world models struggle with goal specification: text is too abstract for physical nuances, while target images are infeasible for dynamic tasks. There's a need for more precise, physics-aware goal specification that mirrors how humans conceptualize physical interactions.

Method: Train a video generation model on synthetic causal primitives dataset (elastic collisions, falling dominos) to propagate forces through time and space. Users define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics rather than text or target images.

Result: The model shows remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex real-world scenarios including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains, despite being trained only on simple physics data. It emerges as an implicit neural physics simulator.

Conclusion: By grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can become implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external physics engines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

*Yinghan Xu,John Dingliana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework decomposes posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D avatars (body + garments) using 2D Gaussians and diffusion-based inpainting, enabling realistic virtual try-on.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. There's a need for better separation of body and garments for animatable avatars.

Method: Uses 2D Gaussians to encode each layer for geometry/rendering, inpaints hidden regions with pretrained 2D diffusion via SDS. Three-stage training: coarse canonical garment reconstruction, then multi-layer training to jointly recover body and garment details.

Result: Achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition/recomposition than SOTA on 4D-Dress and Thuman2.0 datasets. Enables realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses.

Conclusion: Advances practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications by enabling animatable multi-layered avatars with separated body and garments.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

*Kaiwen Huang,Yizhe Zhang,Yi Zhou,Tianyang Xu,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCSI framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation uses semantic-spatial perturbation, channel-selective routing, and bidirectional interaction to improve performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods (mean teacher, dual-stream consistency) suffer from error accumulation, model complexity, and neglect interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams.

Method: 1) Semantic-Spatial Perturbation (SSP) with strong augmentations and pseudo-labels from weak augmentations; 2) Channel-selective Router (CR) for dynamic channel selection; 3) Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction (BCI) for semantic enhancement.

Result: Outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets.

Conclusion: BCSI framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by improving feature interaction, reducing noise, and enhancing semantic representation for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.

*Zhen-Xin Lin,Shang-Kuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phase4DFD is a deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase information in frequency domain, using phase-aware attention to guide detection of manipulation artifacts that are hard to spot in spatial domain alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing deepfake detection methods focus on spatial domain or only use spectral magnitude in frequency domain, implicitly under-exploring phase information which contains important manipulation artifacts from synthetic generation processes.

Method: Proposes Phase4DFD framework that: 1) Augments RGB input with FFT magnitude and LBP representations, 2) Introduces input-level phase-aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities to guide model toward most indicative frequency patterns, 3) Processes attended multi-domain representation with BNext M backbone, 4) Optionally applies channel-spatial attention for feature refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAKE and DFFD datasets show Phase4DFD outperforms state-of-the-art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Ablation studies confirm explicit phase modeling provides complementary, non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of phase information in frequency domain deepfake detection is crucial, as phase discontinuities from synthetic generation provide complementary signals to magnitude information, leading to improved detection performance with efficient computational requirements.

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Relay tokens enable vision transformers to process images at both local (high-res) and global (low-res) scales simultaneously, preserving fine details while maintaining global context for ultra high-resolution segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ultra high-resolution image segmentation either use sliding windows (losing global context) or downsampling (losing fine details), creating a need for an approach that preserves both local precision and global awareness.

Method: Process images in parallel at local scale (high resolution, small crops) and global scale (low resolution, large crops), then aggregate and propagate features between branches using a small set of learnable relay tokens that plug into standard transformer backbones like ViT and Swin.

Result: Consistent gains across three ultra high-resolution segmentation benchmarks (Archaeoscape, URUR, Gleason) and Cityscapes, with up to 15% relative mIoU improvement, while adding fewer than 2% parameters to standard backbones.

Conclusion: The relay token approach provides an effective, lightweight solution for multi-scale reasoning in vision transformers, enabling simultaneous preservation of local details and global context for ultra high-resolution segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Current approaches for segmenting ultra high resolution images either slide a window, thereby discarding global context, or downsample and lose fine detail. We propose a simple yet effective method that brings explicit multi scale reasoning to vision transformers, simultaneously preserving local details and global awareness. Concretely, we process each image in parallel at a local scale (high resolution, small crops) and a global scale (low resolution, large crops), and aggregate and propagate features between the two branches with a small set of learnable relay tokens. The design plugs directly into standard transformer backbones (eg ViT and Swin) and adds fewer than 2 % parameters. Extensive experiments on three ultra high resolution segmentation benchmarks, Archaeoscape, URUR, and Gleason, and on the conventional Cityscapes dataset show consistent gains, with up to 15 % relative mIoU improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic cancer has poor survival rates, and current endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) diagnosis is limited by operator subjectivity. There's a need for automated, objective tumor segmentation to improve diagnostic accuracy and consistency.

Method: Used Vision Transformer backbone within USFM framework, trained on 17,367 EUS images from two public datasets with 5-fold cross-validation. Tested on independent dataset of 350 images. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer-based model demonstrates strong potential for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images, but dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation indicate need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective clinical studies.

Abstract: Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation.

Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.

*Mehrdad Fazli,Bowen Wei,Ziwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a training-free method to reduce hallucinations in large vision-language models by leveraging layer-wise generation dynamics and using context embeddings as grounding signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations (responses inconsistent with visual input) remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models, especially in open-ended tasks like image captioning and visual reasoning. The authors aim to understand and mitigate this problem without requiring additional training.

Method: The authors first analyze layer-wise generation dynamics using the Logit Lens, discovering a "commitment-depth gap" where truthful tokens accumulate probability mass earlier than hallucinatory ones. Based on this insight, they propose Context Embedding Injection (CEI), which uses the hidden state of the last input token (context embedding) as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding. CEI has both static and dynamic variants.

Result: CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs on CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with maximum token length of 512). The dynamic variant achieves the lowest overall hallucination rates.

Conclusion: The work advances hallucination mitigation in LVLMs by combining novel mechanistic insights about generation dynamics with a scalable, training-free intervention that effectively reduces hallucinations while maintaining visual fidelity.

Abstract: Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveRNet: A wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation that addresses domain shift from illumination/contrast variations while preserving fine vessel structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in retinal vessel segmentation caused by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast degrades generalization. Existing SAM-based methods overlook frequency-domain information and lose fine vessel details during upsampling.

Method: Three key components: 1) Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) using wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, 2) Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) for test-time domain selection via wavelet-based similarity, 3) Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) for coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling.

Result: State-of-the-art generalization performance under Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets, demonstrating robust performance against illumination and contrast variations.

Conclusion: WaveRNet effectively addresses domain shift in retinal vessel segmentation by leveraging frequency-domain information and overcoming SAM's limitations, providing a robust solution for automated ophthalmic diagnosis.

Abstract: Domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation is critical for automated ophthalmic diagnosis, yet faces significant challenges from domain shift induced by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, compounded by the difficulty of preserving fine vessel structures. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models (diffusion and flow-matching) are computationally intensive and difficult to scale. There's a need for more efficient alternatives that maintain high quality while being scalable.

Method: VideoAR integrates intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction using a 3D multi-scale tokenizer.

Conclusion: VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

TL;DR: AC-CAR is a contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework that generalizes to unseen imaging contrasts using adaptive conditional feature modulation and contrast-invariant latent regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is challenging due to complex non-linear intensity relationships across different imaging contrasts. Conventional methods are time-consuming, while learning-based approaches lack generalizability to unseen contrasts.

Method: Proposes AC-CAR framework with: 1) Random convolution-based contrast augmentation, 2) Adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) for contrast-invariant feature learning, 3) Contrast-invariant latent regularization for feature consistency, and 4) Variance network for contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty estimation.

Result: AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts. The framework also provides uncertainty estimation to improve trustworthiness.

Conclusion: AC-CAR enables fast, accurate, and generalizable deformable image registration across arbitrary imaging contrasts without requiring training data for those specific contrasts, addressing a key limitation in current learning-based registration methods.

Abstract: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is a challenging yet crucial task due to the complex, non-linear intensity relationships across different imaging contrasts. Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.

*Adrian Serrano,Erwan Umlil,Ronan Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deepfake detectors show limited robustness to adversarial attacks in real-world scenarios with data distribution mismatches, despite adversarial training defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deepfake detection systems face adversaries who can craft imperceptible perturbations to degrade performance. The effectiveness of adversarial training defenses under realistic conditions with limited attacker knowledge and mismatched data distributions is not well understood.

Method: Extended DUMB/DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection, evaluating robustness against adversarial attacks under transferability constraints and cross-dataset configurations. Studied 5 detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL), 3 attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA), and 2 datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF-V2). Analyzed both attacker and defender perspectives across mismatch scenarios.

Result: Adversarial training strategies improve robustness in in-distribution cases but can degrade performance under cross-dataset configurations depending on the specific strategy used. The effectiveness varies based on the mismatch scenario.

Conclusion: Case-aware defense strategies are needed for real-world deepfake detection applications exposed to adversarial attacks, as one-size-fits-all adversarial training approaches may not work effectively across different data distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Deepfake detection systems deployed in real-world environments are subject to adversaries capable of crafting imperceptible perturbations that degrade model performance. While adversarial training is a widely adopted defense, its effectiveness under realistic conditions -- where attackers operate with limited knowledge and mismatched data distributions - remains underexplored. In this work, we extend the DUMB -- Dataset soUrces, Model architecture and Balance - and DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection. We evaluate detectors robustness against adversarial attacks under transferability constraints and cross-dataset configuration to extract real-world insights. Our study spans five state-of-the-art detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL), three attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA), and two datasets (FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF-V2). We analyze both attacker and defender perspectives mapping results to mismatch scenarios. Experiments show that adversarial training strategies reinforce robustness in the in-distribution cases but can also degrade it under cross-dataset configuration depending on the strategy adopted. These findings highlight the need for case-aware defense strategies in real-world applications exposed to adversarial attacks.

### [112] [TagRAG: Tag-guided Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05254)
*Wenbiao Tao,Yunshi Lan,Weining Qian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TagRAG is a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework that improves global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance by using domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG methods use fragment-level retrieval which limits query-focused summarization. GraphRAG enables global knowledge reasoning but suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, high resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates.

Method: Two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction - extracts object tags and their relationships from documents, organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation; (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation - retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference.

Result: Achieves average win rate of 95.41% against baselines on UltraDomain datasets (Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, cross-domain). Maintains about 14.6x construction efficiency and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared to GraphRAG.

Conclusion: TagRAG significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, supports efficient knowledge increment, and provides an efficient framework for global reasoning with scalable graph maintenance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving external knowledge to support informed and grounded responses. However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average win rate of 95.41\% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.

### [113] [Quantifying Document Impact in RAG-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05260)
*Armin Gerami,Kazem Faghih,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that quantifies the contribution of individual retrieved documents to RAG system outputs, validated through poison attack simulations and ablation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluation lacks metrics to quantify individual document contributions, making it difficult to address challenges like factual inconsistencies, source conflicts, bias propagation, and security vulnerabilities that undermine RAG trustworthiness.

Method: Proposes Influence Score (IS) based on Partial Information Decomposition to measure each retrieved document's impact on generated responses. Validated through two experiments: 1) poison attack simulation across three datasets, and 2) ablation study comparing responses from top-ranked vs. remaining documents.

Result: IS correctly identified malicious documents in 86% of poison attack cases. Ablation study showed responses from top-ranked IS documents were consistently judged more similar to original responses than those from remaining documents.

Conclusion: IS effectively isolates and quantifies document influence, providing a valuable tool for improving RAG system transparency and reliability by enabling better understanding of individual document contributions.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by connecting them to external knowledge, improving accuracy and reducing outdated information. However, this introduces challenges such as factual inconsistencies, source conflicts, bias propagation, and security vulnerabilities, which undermine the trustworthiness of RAG systems. A key gap in current RAG evaluation is the lack of a metric to quantify the contribution of individual retrieved documents to the final output. To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents. These results confirm the efficacy of IS in isolating and quantifying document influence, offering a valuable tool for improving the transparency and reliability of RAG systems.

TL;DR: LLM2IR converts decoder-only LLMs to IR models via unsupervised contrastive learning, showing effectiveness across benchmarks and revealing that longer context length correlates with stronger IR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of large-scale pretraining for dense IR models and leverage existing decoder-only LLMs for information retrieval tasks.

Method: An efficient unsupervised contrastive learning framework that converts any decoder-only LLM into an information retrieval model without requiring costly pretraining.

Result: LLM2IR demonstrates effectiveness across different LLMs on multiple IR benchmarks (LoCo, LongEmbed, BEIR), and reveals that models with longer context lengths tend to have stronger IR capacity.

Conclusion: The work provides an effective way to build IR models on state-of-the-art LLMs and sheds light on the relationship between IR ability and model context length, informing better IR model design.

Abstract: Modern dense information retrieval (IR) models usually rely on costly large-scale pretraining. In this paper, we introduce LLM2IR, an efficient unsupervised contrastive learning framework to convert any decoder-only large language model (LLM) to an information retrieval model. Despite its simplicity, the effectiveness is proven among different LLMs on multiple IR benchmarks including LoCo, LongEmbed and BEIR. We also find that models with a longer context length tend to have a stronger IR capacity by comparing task performances of models in the same model family. Our work not only provides an effective way to build IR models on the state-of-the-art LLMs, but also shed light on the relationship between information retrieval ability and model context length, which helps the design of better information retrievers.

### [115] [Cross-Document Topic-Aligned Chunking for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05265)
*Mile Stankovic*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CDTA chunking addresses knowledge fragmentation in RAG by reconstructing knowledge at corpus level through topic alignment across documents, achieving significant improvements in faithfulness and citation accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems suffer from knowledge fragmentation - complex queries require information scattered across multiple documents, but existing chunking methods partition documents individually, failing to capture cross-document relationships needed for comprehensive answers.

Method: Cross-Document Topic-Aligned (CDTA) chunking: 1) identifies topics across the entire document corpus, 2) maps document segments to relevant topics, 3) synthesizes related segments from multiple documents into unified, topic-aligned chunks that reconstruct knowledge at corpus level.

Result: On HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning: 0.93 faithfulness vs 0.83 (contextual retrieval) and 0.78 (semantic chunking) - 12% improvement over industry best practice. On UAE Legal texts: 0.94 faithfulness with 0.93 citation accuracy. At k=3: maintains 0.91 faithfulness while semantic methods drop to 0.68.

Conclusion: CDTA chunking produces information-dense chunks that reduce query-time retrieval needs. While indexing costs are higher, the method significantly improves performance for high-query-volume applications with distributed knowledge, making cross-document synthesis superior to within-document optimization.

Abstract: Chunking quality determines RAG system performance. Current methods partition documents individually, but complex queries need information scattered across multiple sources: the knowledge fragmentation problem. We introduce Cross-Document Topic-Aligned (CDTA) chunking, which reconstructs knowledge at the corpus level. It first identifies topics across documents, maps segments to each topic, and synthesizes them into unified chunks.
  On HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning, our method reached 0.93 faithfulness versus 0.83 for contextual retrieval and 0.78 for semantic chunking, a 12% improvement over current industry best practice (p < 0.05). On UAE Legal texts, it reached 0.94 faithfulness with 0.93 citation accuracy. At k = 3, it maintains 0.91 faithfulness while semantic methods drop to 0.68, with a single CDTA chunk containing information requiring multiple traditional fragments.
  Indexing costs are higher, but synthesis produces information-dense chunks that reduce query-time retrieval needs. For high-query-volume applications with distributed knowledge, cross-document synthesis improves measurably over within-document optimization.

Motivation: Industrial part specification extraction from unstructured text is challenging, with manual processing being time-consuming and error-prone. Single-model systems have limitations that need to be addressed for reliable industrial applications.

Method: A three-phase pipeline: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, Mistral, Gemma families), (2) targeted research augmentation using high-performing models, (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. Uses FAISS-based semantic retrieval for real-time access to structured part databases.

Conclusion: RAGsemble provides a scalable ensemble architecture with seamless RAG integration, comprehensive quality assessment, and a production-ready solution for knowledge-intensive manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Industrial part specification extraction from unstructured text remains a persistent challenge in manufacturing, procurement, and maintenance, where manual processing is both time-consuming and error-prone. This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines. Key contributions include a scalable ensemble architecture for industrial domains, seamless RAG integration throughout the pipeline, comprehensive quality assessment mechanisms, and a production-ready solution suitable for deployment in knowledge-intensive manufacturing environments.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) fine-tuned image classification model filters text-only pages, (2) efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations, (3) multimodal image captioning model generates human-readable descriptions stored in searchable database.

Result: Processed over 3 million digitized manuscript pages, automatically identifying and extracting more than 200,000 unique illustrations at under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforming traditional segmentation techniques.

Conclusion: Cutting-edge AI tools can profoundly reshape scholarly workflows and open new avenues for multidisciplinary research in digital humanities, empowering scholars to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with unprecedented precision and speed.

Abstract: The recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution has opened transformative possibilities for the humanities, particularly in unlocking the visual content embedded in historical manuscripts. While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically study illustrations at a large scale remains challenging. Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations. This scale of processing in under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforms traditional segmentation techniques in both efficiency and accessibility for visual scholarship. Our work demonstrates how cutting-edge AI tools can profoundly reshape scholarly workflows and open new avenues for multidisciplinary research in the age of digital manuscripts.

TL;DR: Interpretable aggregation framework combining LLM scoring with Analytic Hierarchy Process for evaluating complex texts across domains with high explainability and operational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for evaluating complex texts have limitations: single-prompt LLM evaluations suffer from complexity and latency issues, while criterion-specific decomposition methods rely on naive averaging or opaque black-box aggregation, making it difficult to convert user-defined criteria into quantitative, explainable indicators for search and recommendation systems.

Method: Combines LLM scoring with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The method generates criterion-specific scores via LLM-as-judge, measures discriminative power using Jensen-Shannon distance, and derives statistically grounded weights through AHP pairwise comparison matrices.

Result: Experiments on Amazon review quality assessment and depression-related text scoring demonstrate that the approach achieves high explainability and operational efficiency while maintaining comparable predictive power to existing methods.

Conclusion: The interpretable aggregation framework is suitable for real-time latency-sensitive web services, providing a statistically grounded, explainable alternative to opaque black-box aggregation methods for text evaluation across domains.

*Honghao Liu,Xuhui Jiang,Chengjin Xu,Cehao Yang,Yiran Cheng,Lionel Ni,Jian Guo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes entity-based encrypted data synthesis for privacy-preserving continual pretraining of LLMs on sensitive domain-specific data, using deterministic encryption on PII entities with weighted entity graphs for guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to preserve privacy when pretraining LLMs on small, domain-specific corpora containing sensitive PII data, enabling secure continual pretraining while protecting personally identifiable information.

Method: Entity-based framework with weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis, applying deterministic encryption to PII entities, allowing authorized access via decryption keys while enabling continual pretraining.

Result: Pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, with modest performance gap compared to unencrypted synthetic data. Increasing entities and graph-based synthesis improves performance, and encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities.

Conclusion: This work serves as initial investigation into encrypted data pretraining for privacy-preserving LLMs, demonstrating feasibility while discussing security implications and limitations of deterministic encryption.

Abstract: Preserving privacy in sensitive data while pretraining large language models on small, domain-specific corpora presents a significant challenge. In this work, we take an exploratory step toward privacy-preserving continual pretraining by proposing an entity-based framework that synthesizes encrypted training data to protect personally identifiable information (PII). Our approach constructs a weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis and applies deterministic encryption to PII entities, enabling LLMs to encode new knowledge through continual pretraining while granting authorized access to sensitive data through decryption keys. Our results on limited-scale datasets demonstrate that our pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, while exhibiting a modest performance gap compared to models trained on unencrypted synthetic data. We further show that increasing the number of entities and leveraging graph-based synthesis improves model performance, and that encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities with long retrieved contexts. We discuss the security implications and limitations of deterministic encryption, positioning this work as an initial investigation into the design space of encrypted data pretraining for privacy-preserving LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataArcTech/SoE.

*Zhi Wang,Zhongbin Wu,Yanni Li,Bing Liu,Guangxi Li,Yuping Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETCL is a novel continual learning method that achieves forgetting-free learning with positive forward and backward knowledge transfer through task-specific binary masks, gradient alignment, and bi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning research focuses mainly on overcoming catastrophic forgetting, but an ideal CL agent should also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer between tasks.

Method: ETCL uses task-specific binary masks to isolate sparse sub-networks for each task while preserving dense network performance. It aligns new task gradients with previous similar tasks for positive forward transfer, and uses bi-objective optimization with orthogonal gradient projection for positive backward transfer.

Result: Extensive evaluations show ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.

Conclusion: ETCL successfully achieves forgetting-free continual learning with positive knowledge transfer through theoretical bounds estimation, online task similarity detection, and novel optimization strategies.

Abstract: Existing research on continual learning (CL) of a sequence of tasks focuses mainly on dealing with catastrophic forgetting (CF) to balance the learning plasticity of new tasks and the memory stability of old tasks. However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.

*Susmit Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIME is a framework that makes LLMs use brief, context-sensitive reasoning triggered by discourse cues and time gaps, instead of long pre-response thinking traces, improving temporal reasoning while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs use long, turn-global reasoning traces that are costly, reduce auditability, and can't be re-triggered. They also lack temporal awareness, treating all replies as equivalent regardless of time gaps.

Method: TIME introduces ISO 8601 time tags, tick turns for silent gaps, and short <think> blocks anywhere in replies. Uses 4-phase curriculum training with full-batch alignment to train Qwen3 models for context-sensitive reasoning bursts.

Result: Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about 10x.

Conclusion: TIME enables more efficient, temporally-aware reasoning in dialogue models through context-sensitive reasoning bursts and temporal markup, addressing limitations of current turn-global reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit "thinking" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AGDC is a unified framework for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion modeling for continuous values, addressing precision limitations in high-precision domains like semiconductor circuit design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based autoregressive models are limited by discretized tokens when handling continuous values, especially in high-precision domains like semiconductor circuit design where precision loss can cause functional failures. Existing discretization approaches don't scale well for hybrid discrete-continuous sequences requiring high precision.

Method: AGDC uses a hybrid approach combining categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values. Key components include: 1) EOS logit adjustment mechanism using an MLP to dynamically adjust end-of-sequence token logits based on sequence context, and 2) length regularization term in the loss function. Also introduces ContLayNet benchmark with 334K semiconductor layout samples.

Result: AGDC demonstrates superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines across semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs. Achieves scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.

Conclusion: AGDC provides an effective unified framework for joint modeling of discrete and continuous values in variable-length sequences, enabling high-precision generation in domains where precision is critical, such as semiconductor circuit design.

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models excel in data generation but are inherently constrained by their reliance on discretized tokens, which limits their ability to represent continuous values with high precision. We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RingSQL is a hybrid text-to-SQL data generation framework combining schema-independent query templates with LLM paraphrasing to create high-quality training data with guaranteed SQL correctness and linguistic variety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-SQL progress is limited by scarce high-quality training data. Manual creation is expensive, while existing synthetic methods trade off reliability (template-based) and scalability (LLM-based). There's a need for a method that ensures SQL correctness while providing linguistic diversity across diverse schemas.

Method: RingSQL combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing. The templates ensure SQL correctness across diverse schemas, while LLMs generate varied natural language questions for the same SQL queries, providing linguistic diversity without compromising correctness.

Result: Models trained on RingSQL-generated data achieve an average accuracy gain of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks compared to models trained on other synthetic data.

Conclusion: RingSQL effectively addresses the data scarcity problem in text-to-SQL by providing a scalable, schema-independent approach that guarantees SQL correctness while offering rich linguistic variety, leading to improved model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-SQL systems have been driven by larger models and improved datasets, yet progress is still limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data. Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability. Template-based approaches ensure correct SQL but require schema-specific templates, while LLM-based generation scales easily but lacks quality and correctness guarantees. We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions. This approach preserves SQL correctness across diverse schemas while providing broad linguistic variety. In our experiments, we find that models trained using data produced by RingSQL achieve an average gain in accuracy of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks when compared to models trained on other synthetic data. We make our code available at https://github.com/nu-c3lab/RingSQL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaxCode is an inference-time search framework that uses RL principles with natural language critiques and generative reward models to help LLMs optimize code performance beyond binary correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with code optimization due to: (1) complexity of writing optimized code requiring systems/algorithms expertise, and (2) difficulty interpreting performance metrics beyond binary correctness.

Method: Unifies search methods under max-reward RL framework with modular observation/action functions. Adds natural language critique model to convert execution feedback into diagnostic insights, and trains generative reward-to-go model using action values to rerank solutions.

Result: On KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) benchmarks, achieves 20.3% relative improvement in absolute speedup value and 10.1% improvement in relative speedup ranking compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MaxCode demonstrates effective inference-time search for code optimization by enhancing LLM observations with performance diagnostics and improving exploration through learned reward models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general coding tasks but encounter two key challenges when optimizing code: (i) the complexity of writing optimized code (such as performant CUDA kernels and competition-level CPU code) requires expertise in systems, algorithms and specific languages and (ii) requires interpretation of performance metrics like timing and device utilization beyond binary correctness. In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively.

### [125] [Hi-ZFO: Hierarchical Zeroth- and First-Order LLM Fine-Tuning via Importance-Guided Tensor Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05501)
*Feihu Jin,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hi-ZFO is a hybrid optimization framework that combines zeroth-order and first-order methods for LLM fine-tuning, using layer-wise partitioning to apply precise FO updates to critical layers while using ZO as beneficial stochasticity to escape local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard first-order optimization for LLM fine-tuning tends to converge to sharp, poorly generalizing minima, while zeroth-order methods offer better exploration but suffer from slow convergence and high variance in generative tasks with large output spaces.

Method: Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise first-order updates to critical layers while leveraging zeroth-order optimization for less sensitive ones. ZO is intentionally used as "beneficial stochasticity" to help escape local minima.

Result: Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing training time compared to pure FO or ZO methods.

Conclusion: The hierarchical hybrid optimization approach effectively combines the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation for improved LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using standard first-order (FO) optimization often drives training toward sharp, poorly generalizing minima. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Z}eroth- and \textbf{F}irst-\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of "beneficial stochasticity" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.

*Yifan Zhang,Wei Bi,Kechi Zhang,Dongming Jin,Jie Fu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Discrete Transformer enables algorithm extraction from trained models by enforcing functional disentanglement and using temperature-annealed sampling to bridge continuous representations with discrete symbolic logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current algorithm extraction from Transformers is hindered by superposition (entangled features in overlapping directions), which obstructs extraction of symbolic expressions. There's a need to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic for better interpretability.

Method: Proposes Discrete Transformer architecture with strict functional disentanglement: Numerical Attention handles information routing, Numerical MLP handles element-wise arithmetic. Uses temperature-annealed sampling to facilitate program extraction.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines, extends interpretability to continuous variable domains, shows clear phase transition in annealing process, and enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs through inductive biases.

Conclusion: Discrete Transformer establishes a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery and offers a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability by effectively bridging continuous representations with discrete symbolic logic.

Abstract: Algorithm extraction aims to synthesize executable programs directly from models trained on specific algorithmic tasks, enabling de novo algorithm discovery without relying on human-written code. However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.

### [127] [Fusion Matters: Length-Aware Analysis of Positional-Encoding Fusion in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05807)
*Mohamed Amine Hallam,Kuo-Kun Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Positional encoding fusion mechanisms (addition vs. concatenation vs. gating) matter for long-sequence Transformers but not for short texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. The paper investigates whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, especially in long-sequence settings.

Method: Controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies (element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, scalar gated fusion) under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences. Additional experiments include paired-seed analysis, cross-dataset comparison, and evaluation of a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism with local inductive bias.

Result: Fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. The benefits are structural rather than stochastic, as verified by paired-seed analysis. The advantage of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. The convolutional gating mechanism shows promise for long documents.

Conclusion: Positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.

Abstract: Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.

*Eirini Baltzi,Tilemachos Moumouris,Athena Psalta,Vasileios Tsironis,Konstantinos Karantzalos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NAIAD is an agentic AI assistant that uses LLMs and external tools to provide holistic inland water monitoring from Earth Observation data through natural language queries, achieving over 77% correctness and 85% relevancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing water monitoring methods address isolated sub-problems separately (cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, etc.), lacking integrated solutions. There's a need for holistic monitoring accessible to both experts and non-experts using Earth Observation data.

Method: NAIAD combines LLMs with external analytical tools through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection. It integrates tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing indices (NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and platforms like CyFi.

Result: Achieved over 77% correctness and 85% relevancy on a dedicated benchmark across multiple user-expertise levels. Shows strong adaptability and robustness across query types. Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) offer best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

Conclusion: NAIAD provides a holistic, accessible solution for inland water monitoring through natural language interfaces, demonstrating strong performance and adaptability while bridging the gap between isolated monitoring approaches.

Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Persona conditioning in LLMs shows context-dependent effects: improves critical care performance but degrades primary care, with non-monotonic safety impacts rather than guaranteed expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how persona-based control (professional roles and interaction styles) affects clinical LLM behavior in high-stakes decision-making, challenging the assumption that personas monotonically improve expertise and safety.

Method: Systematic evaluation of persona-based control across models and medical tasks using professional roles (Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs. cautious). Multidimensional assessments of task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks.

Result: Medical personas improve critical care performance (+20% accuracy/calibration) but degrade primary care performance by similar margins. Interaction style effects are model-dependent. LLM-judges favor medical personas for safety, but human clinicians show only moderate safety agreement (κ=0.43) and low confidence (95.9%) in reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Personas function as behavioral priors with context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise, revealing a "persona paradox" where conditioning can both help and harm depending on clinical context.

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

### [130] [PII-VisBench: Evaluating Personally Identifiable Information Safety in Vision Language Models Along a Continuum of Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05739)
*G M Shahariar,Zabir Al Nazi,Md Olid Hasan Bhuiyan,Zhouxing Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PII-VisBench benchmark evaluates VLMs' PII leakage across different online presence levels, showing models leak more PII for high-visibility subjects and are vulnerable to prompt attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM privacy evaluations treat PII leakage as static extraction and ignore how a subject's online presence (data volume available online) affects privacy alignment, creating a gap in understanding real-world privacy risks.

Method: Created PII-VisBench with 4000 unique probes across 200 subjects stratified into four visibility categories (high, medium, low, zero). Evaluated 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) using Refusal Rate and Conditional PII Disclosure Rate metrics, plus tested paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts.

Result: Models show consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. High-visibility subjects trigger more PII disclosure, with substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Prompt attacks expose vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: VLMs' privacy alignment varies with subject visibility, creating visibility-dependent safety gaps. Findings motivate visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions to address real-world privacy risks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

### [131] [Conformity and Social Impact on AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05384)
*Alessandro Bellina,Giordano De Marzo,David Garcia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents exhibit systematic conformity bias in multi-agent environments, making them vulnerable to social manipulation despite high individual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting artificial society dynamics and identifying security vulnerabilities.

Method: Adapted classic visual experiments from social psychology to investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors, examining factors like group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics.

Result: AI agents show systematic conformity bias aligned with Social Impact Theory, with near-perfect individual performers becoming highly susceptible to social manipulation. Vulnerability persists across model scales - larger models reduce conformity on simple tasks but remain vulnerable at competence boundaries.

Conclusion: AI agents have fundamental security vulnerabilities in decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

*Ali Farjami,Luca Redondi,Marco Valentino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework that treats logic as a parametric component for natural language inference, enabling systematic comparison of different formalisms and showing logic-internal approaches improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neuro-symbolic approaches for verifiable natural language inference rely on fixed logical formalisms, limiting robustness and adaptability. The paper aims to create a more flexible framework where logic can be treated as a controllable component.

Method: Proposes a logic-parametric framework using LogiKEy methodology to embed various classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic. Compares logic-external (axiomatic) vs logic-internal (built-in structure) approaches for normative reasoning.

Result: Logic-internal strategies consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs. Effectiveness is domain-dependent: first-order logic favors commonsense reasoning, while deontic/modal logics excel in ethical domains.

Conclusion: Treating logic as a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures enables more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning, with logic-internal approaches showing particular promise for normative domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

TL;DR: OKR-CELL is a single-cell foundation model that integrates open-world knowledge from LLMs with robust cross-modal alignment to handle noisy multi-omics data, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 6 evaluation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-cell foundation models based on pre-trained language models have limitations: they insufficiently integrate in-depth individual cellular profiles and neglect the influence of noise within multi-modal data, which hampers their effectiveness in capturing true biological signals.

Method: Proposes OKR-CELL with two key innovations: (1) LLM-based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enrich cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge, and (2) Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective incorporating sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to enhance noise resistance.

Result: After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL achieves cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks including cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, few-shot annotation, zero-shot cell-type annotation, and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.

Conclusion: OKR-CELL successfully addresses limitations of existing single-cell foundation models by integrating open-world knowledge and robust noise-handling mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance in both standard and broader multi-modal applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.

*Xudong Xie,Yuwei Zhang,Wensheng Dou,Yu Gao,Ziyu Cui,Jiansen Song,Rui Yang,Jun Wei*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: RISE is an LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that handles complex queries by first simplifying them, extracting translation rules, then applying those rules to the original complex query.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SQL dialect translation tools require manual rule creation for each RDBMS/dialect, which is labor-intensive. LLMs struggle with lengthy/complex SQL queries, creating a need for a more effective automated solution.

Method: 1) Use dialect-aware query reduction to simplify complex queries by removing dialect-irrelevant elements. 2) Use LLMs to translate simplified queries. 3) Extract translation rules from simplified query pairs. 4) Apply extracted rules to original complex queries.

Result: Achieved 97.98% accuracy on TPC-DS and 100% accuracy on SQLProcBench benchmarks, outperforming baselines by average improvements of 24.62% and 238.41% respectively.

Conclusion: RISE effectively handles complex SQL dialect translation by combining query simplification with rule extraction, significantly outperforming both traditional rule-based tools and direct LLM approaches.

Abstract: Translating SQL dialects across different relational database management systems (RDBMSs) is crucial for migrating RDBMS-based applications to the cloud. Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries.
  In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively.

TL;DR: HumDial Challenge at ICASSP 2026 benchmarks spoken dialogue systems on emotional intelligence and real-time interaction capabilities using authentic human conversation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve truly human-like communication, spoken dialogue systems need both emotional intelligence (to perceive and resonate with users' emotions) and robust interaction mechanisms (to handle dynamic, natural conversation flow like real-time turn-taking).

Method: Created the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) anchored by a sizable dataset from authentic human conversations, with two evaluation tracks: Emotional Intelligence (long-term emotion understanding and empathetic generation) and Full-Duplex Interaction (real-time decision-making under "listening-while-speaking" conditions).

Result: Established a fair evaluation platform for benchmarking spoken dialogue systems' dual capabilities, with specific track configurations and final results summarized in the paper.

Conclusion: The HumDial Challenge provides a comprehensive benchmark for advancing spoken dialogue systems toward more human-like communication by systematically evaluating both emotional intelligence and real-time interaction capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Audio-LLMs and Omni-models, spoken dialogue systems have evolved significantly, progressively narrowing the gap between human-machine and human-human interactions. Achieving truly ``human-like'' communication necessitates a dual capability: emotional intelligence to perceive and resonate with users' emotional states, and robust interaction mechanisms to navigate the dynamic, natural flow of conversation, such as real-time turn-taking. Therefore, we launched the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) at ICASSP 2026 to benchmark these dual capabilities. Anchored by a sizable dataset derived from authentic human conversations, this initiative establishes a fair evaluation platform across two tracks: (1) Emotional Intelligence, targeting long-term emotion understanding and empathetic generation; and (2) Full-Duplex Interaction, systematically evaluating real-time decision-making under `` listening-while-speaking'' conditions. This paper summarizes the dataset, track configurations, and the final results.
