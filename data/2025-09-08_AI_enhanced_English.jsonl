For detecting\ncomplex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but\nalso the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global\nappearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model\n(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the\ngroup structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are\nstabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method\ndetects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with\nall frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP\nfeatures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets.
