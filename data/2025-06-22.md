### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from elderly patients' discharge summaries is presented, addressing underrepresented populations and complex annotation challenges. Transformer models perform well on coarse tasks but struggle with fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical NLP resources and tackle challenges like discontinuous and overlapping entities in AE extraction.

Method: A manually annotated dataset of 14 clinically significant AEs was created. Multiple models, including transformer-based ones like BERT, were evaluated across three annotation granularities.

Result: BERT achieved strong performance on coarse-grained tasks (F1 = 0.943) but dropped for fine-grained tasks (F1 = 0.675), especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a benchmark for AE extraction, highlighting challenges in detecting underrepresented AEs and nuanced clinical language.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) improves structured NLP tasks by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases, leveraging complementary errors for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome low-quality output in constrained decoding by exploiting complementary errors from constrained and unconstrained decoding.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase 1 generates weak predictions (constrained and unconstrained), and Phase 2 combines them using a learned boosted model.

Result: BoostCD outperforms prior methods in closed information extraction (BoostIE), addressing common errors.

Conclusion: BoostCD effectively improves structured NLP task performance by leveraging complementary decoding errors.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst is a weakly supervised framework for assessing context document credibility in LLMs, improving accuracy and F1 scores without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore varying credibility of context documents, risking unreliable information propagation.

Method: CrEst uses inter-document agreement for automated credibility estimation, with black-box and white-box integration strategies for LLMs.

Result: CrEst outperforms baselines, achieving up to 26.86% accuracy and 3.49% F1 score improvements, even under high noise.

Conclusion: CrEst effectively enhances LLM performance by integrating credibility assessment, proving robust in noisy conditions.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench is a new synthetic dataset for evaluating multi-document reasoning in LLMs, created via LLM-assisted edits of structured knowledge, posing significant challenges for current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of benchmarks for multi-document reasoning in LLMs due to costly annotation and the need for rigorous evaluation.

Method: Uses a synthetic generation process with LLM-assisted edits on structured knowledge to create document sets and QA examples.

Result: MDBench challenges current LLMs and prompting techniques, even with short documents, and enables targeted analysis.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique is efficient, adaptable, and useful for future model improvements.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores LLMs for diabetes prediction using PIDD, comparing six LLMs (including open-source and proprietary) and three traditional ML models. Proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B outperform others, but performance varies with prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the untapped potential of LLMs for structured numerical data in diabetes prediction, comparing them with traditional ML models.

Method: Empirical analysis using PIDD, evaluating six LLMs (Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-2B, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) and three ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) with zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting. Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Result: Proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma-2-27B) perform best, with Gemma-2-27B surpassing traditional ML models in F1-score. Performance varies by prompting strategy.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for medical predictions, but future work should focus on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to enhance healthcare applications.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate reversible sentence embeddings using a special memory token, enabling exact text reconstruction without weight modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of LLMs to reconstruct original text from embeddings without altering model weights.

Method: Introduce a special memory token whose embedding is optimized for fixed sequences, enabling exact reconstruction when prompted.

Result: Successful reconstruction across English and Spanish datasets, sequences up to 240 tokens, and model scales from 100M to 8B parameters.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLMs' potential for memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify social isolation and loneliness in suicide narratives, revealing key predictors like gender, sexual orientation, and marital status.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured data on social isolation and loneliness in suicide reports, the study leverages NLP to extract insights from narratives.

Method: The study employs topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers to analyze 300,000 suicides from 2002-2020.

Result: High-quality classifiers (F1: .86, accuracy: .82) identified 1,198 cases of chronic social isolation, with higher odds for men, gay individuals, and divorced persons.

Conclusion: The methods can enhance surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in the US.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT is a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation, outperforming traditional metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore by aligning better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating long-form generation lack coherence, style, or relevance, and are biased by pretraining data.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality datasets to provide semantic reward feedback for GRPO.

Result: PrefBERT outperforms traditional metrics, aligns well with human preferences, and improves policy model training.

Conclusion: PrefBERT is a reliable and effective solution for evaluating and guiding long-form generation, validated by human and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding affect the unlearning of factual knowledge in LLMs, finding paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning and highlighting challenges in unlearning from text chunks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for unlearning specific knowledge in LLMs due to privacy, outdated, or harmful content, and to understand the impact of learning-time encoding on unlearning.

Method: Empirical investigation of how learning-time knowledge encoding choices influence unlearning effectiveness, focusing on paraphrased descriptions and text chunks.

Result: Paraphrased descriptions enhance unlearning performance, while unlearning from text chunks is difficult.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding is crucial for reliable post-hoc unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve dialogue discourse parsing by resolving ambiguities caused by linguistic features like omission and idiom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in dialogues due to linguistic features like omission and idiom challenge discourse parsing.

Method: Proposes DCM with clarification type and discourse goal reasoning, and CPO to optimize clarifications and reduce errors.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines on STAC and Molweni datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively resolves ambiguities and enhances parsing performance.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

### [11] [CKD-EHR:Clinical Knowledge Distillation for Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15118)
*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The CKD-EHR framework improves disease prediction by distilling knowledge from a fine-tuned large language model (Qwen2.5-7B) to a lightweight BERT model, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EHR-based models lack sufficient medical knowledge representation and clinical deployment efficiency.

Method: The CKD-EHR framework uses knowledge distillation: fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B as a teacher model, generating soft labels, and transferring knowledge to a BERT student model.

Result: On MIMIC-III, CKD-EHR boosts diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and speeds up inference by 22.2x.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR enhances diagnosis accuracy, efficiency, and resource utilization, offering a practical solution for clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage framework for Open-domain Dialogue (OD) generation, addressing the one-to-many (o2m) property by decomposing it into Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS). It introduces o2mDial, a corpus for MRG and PS, and new evaluation metrics, showing improved diversity and quality in smaller LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based dialogue agents ignore the one-to-many (o2m) property of OD, which limits response diversity. This work aims to explicitly model o2m to enhance diversity and coherence.

Method: The framework decomposes OD generation into MRG (generating diverse responses) and PS (selecting based on human preference). It uses o2mDial corpus and introduces in-context learning, instruction-tuning, and novel metrics for MRG, plus a model-based PS approach.

Result: Empirical results show the framework improves response diversity and quality by up to 90% in smaller LLMs, matching larger models' performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling o2m in OD generation via MRG and PS enhances diversity and coherence, making smaller LLMs competitive with larger ones.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok is a Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility by 10% without performance loss, using rule-based pre-tokenization and entropy-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient tokenizer for Korean that reduces token fertility while maintaining model performance.

Method: Uses rule-based pre-tokenization aligned with Korean linguistic structure and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Reduces fertility by ~10%, improving inference speed by 10% without performance loss.

Conclusion: The linguistically informed approach is effective for efficient tokenizer design.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

### [14] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates memory mechanisms in state-space language models, identifying primacy and recency effects, and reveals three key mechanisms behind memory retention and forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models using behavioral tools like primacy and recency effects.

Method: Structured recall tasks applied to the Mamba architecture, with analysis of long-term and short-term memory mechanisms, including targeted ablations and input perturbations on large-scale models.

Result: A U-shaped accuracy profile was observed, with primacy effects linked to sparse channels and recency effects governed by delta-modulated recurrence. Memory allocation is dynamically influenced by semantic regularity.

Conclusion: The study uncovers three distinct mechanisms driving memory patterns in state-space models, validated through experiments on large-scale Mamba-based models.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

*Andrea Cadeddu,Alessandro Chessa,Vincenzo De Leo,Gianni Fenu,Enrico Motta,Francesco Osborne,Diego Reforgiato Recupero,Angelo Salatino,Luca Secchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs for SDG-related text classification, finding smaller models with prompt engineering can match larger models like GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking SDG progress is challenging due to data complexity; LLMs offer potential for automating text analysis.

Method: Analyzed proprietary and open-source LLMs for SDG text classification, testing Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning.

Result: Smaller models with optimized prompts performed as well as larger models like GPT.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering can make smaller LLMs competitive for SDG text classification.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

### [16] [ProtoReasoning: Prototypes as the Foundation for Generalizable Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15211)
*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning enhances LLMs' reasoning via abstract prototypes, improving performance across domains like logic, planning, and math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve cross-domain generalization in LRMs by leveraging shared abstract reasoning prototypes.

Method: Proposes ProtoReasoning, a framework with automated prototype construction, verification, and scalability, using Prolog/PDDL for logical and planning tasks.

Result: Achieves 4.7% (logic), 6.3% (planning), 4.0% (general reasoning), and 1.0% (math) improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Prototype-based learning enhances generalization, validating shared reasoning structures as foundational for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [17] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval is a new method for evaluating open-ended QA, distinguishing factoid and non-factoid questions to improve alignment with human judgments and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics and LLM-based evaluations struggle with semantic nuances, interpretability, and question-type adaptation in open-ended QA.

Method: MinosEval classifies questions as factoid or non-factoid, using adaptive key-point scoring for the former and instance-aware listwise ranking for the latter.

Result: Experiments show MinosEval aligns better with human annotations and provides more interpretable results than existing methods.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses key limitations in open-ended QA evaluation, offering a more refined and interpretable approach.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates language technologies' capacity to understand Basque and Spanish varieties using NLI, revealing performance drops due to linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well current language models handle linguistic variation in Basque and Spanish.

Method: Uses NLI with a manually-curated parallel dataset and tests crosslingual and in-context learning with encoder-only and decoder-based LLMs.

Result: Performance declines with linguistic variation, particularly in Basque, with encoder-only models struggling most with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Linguistic variation, not lexical overlap, causes performance drops, aligning with linguistic theory about peripheral dialects.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph RAG, a framework for historical text analysis, combining chain-of-thought prompting and knowledge graphs to improve domain-specific performance and reduce manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain knowledge gaps in large language models for historical text analysis and reduce labor costs in computational humanities.

Method: Proposes Graph RAG, integrating chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a character relationship dataset. Uses collaborative mechanisms between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: Domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieves F1=0.68 in relation extraction. GraphRAG improves DeepSeek's F1 by 11% on C-CLUE, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Graph RAG provides a low-resource solution for historical knowledge extraction, benefiting humanities research and knowledge services.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness in large-scale QA by leveraging clustering and multi-stage prompt aggregation.

Method: Combines sparse/dense retrieval, K-Means clustering, and cluster-specific prompts for an LLM, followed by filtering and synthesis.

Result: Ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation enhance large-scale RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-DeID is a framework for de-identifying court judgments in South Korea, addressing legal and technical challenges with a DNN-based pipeline and achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current de-identification processes in South Korea are inadequate for large-scale court judgments and lack clear legal definitions for technical solutions.

Method: The framework includes constructing a Korean legal dataset, categorizing PII, and developing a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID effectively balances open justice and data protection, offering a scalable and legally compliant solution.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys LLM applications in clinical trial-patient matching, highlighting their potential and current limitations like proprietary models and weak benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited adoption of LLMs in critical domains like clinical trial recruitment, despite their potential for knowledge aggregation and reasoning.

Method: Analyzes trial-patient matching, contextualizes LLM-based approaches, and examines benchmarks, methods, and evaluation frameworks.

Result: Identifies challenges in adopting LLMs for clinical research and suggests future directions.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for trial-patient matching but face adoption barriers; improved benchmarks and open models are needed.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

TL;DR: A novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach improves language identification (LID) for low-resource languages by 3.2% on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages perform poorly in LID due to class imbalance and bias, often limited to single-domain data.

Method: Proposes a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages.

Result: Improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The SCL approach effectively enhances LID models for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

TL;DR: DeVisE evaluates LLMs in clinical decision support by testing their sensitivity to demographic and vital sign changes in ICU discharge notes, revealing differences in zero-shot and fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs in clinical settings lack depth in distinguishing genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns.

Method: DeVisE uses a dataset of ICU discharge notes (real-world and synthetic) with controlled counterfactuals to test LLMs' sensitivity and reasoning under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.

Result: Zero-shot models show coherent counterfactual reasoning, while fine-tuned models are stable but less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Demographic factors subtly influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing like DeVisE is crucial for understanding clinical LLMs' reasoning and designing safer, fairer medical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

TL;DR: SANSKRITI is a benchmark dataset evaluating LMs' understanding of India's cultural diversity, revealing gaps in culturally nuanced queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of tools assessing LMs' comprehension of local socio-cultural contexts, particularly India's diverse culture.

Method: Created SANSKRITI, a dataset with 21,853 QA pairs covering 16 cultural attributes across India's regions.

Result: Evaluation showed significant disparities in LMs' performance, with struggles in region-specific contexts.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI sets a new standard for improving LMs' cultural understanding.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COSMMIC is a novel multimodal, multilingual dataset for Indian languages, integrating text, images, and user comments to enhance summarization and headline generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research and resources in Indian languages for comment-aware multimodal summarization.

Method: Introduces COSMMIC dataset with 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 comments, tested with LLama3 and GPT-4 across four configurations (text, comments, images, combined).

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness of integrating comments and images for summarization, using classifiers for noise filtering and insight extraction.

Conclusion: COSMMIC bridges gaps in Indian language NLP, advancing inclusivity and multimodal research.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning method to improve lexical alignment in low-resource languages (LRLs) for LLMs, showing significant gains in Swahili-English word pair alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap of LLMs in low-resource languages due to data scarcity and underrepresentation, focusing on cross-lingual lexical alignment.

Method: Proposes TLI, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to fine-tune embeddings from an optimal early layer (Layer 2) in Lugha-Llama-8B-wura.

Result: TLI improves lexical alignment for trained and unseen word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity by ~28%.

Conclusion: TLI effectively enhances cross-lingual knowledge propagation in LRL-focused LLMs, offering a parameter-efficient solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

TL;DR: A framework evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI agents, introducing metrics and methods to address hallucinations and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs for GUI agents suffer from hallucinations (localization errors), compromising reliability.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained evaluation framework, Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), and Context-Aware Cropping to refine input context.

Result: Reveals nuanced failure modes and improves model interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework and methods enhance GUI agent reliability and provide actionable insights.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems struggle with architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance as task complexity and agent numbers grow.

Method: The framework uses a divide-and-conquer parallel architecture, adaptive collaboration engine, and agent organization optimization.

Result: Achieves 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K, 30.4% on AIME, and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval, with notable gains in high-difficulty tasks.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 offers an efficient, general-purpose solution for complex reasoning in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE introduces a framework to assess LLMs' reasoning hierarchy, revealing reliance on statistical recall rather than true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether LLMs' high accuracy stems from true reasoning or memorization, inspired by Pearl's ladder of causation.

Method: RE-IMAGINE uses an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different reasoning levels (associations, interventions, counterfactuals) across domains like math, code, and logic.

Result: Performance drops when LLMs face problem variations, indicating reliance on statistical recall.

Conclusion: The framework highlights LLMs' limitations in reasoning and opens avenues for research on hierarchical reasoning skills.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Motivation: LLMs often require external knowledge to reduce hallucinations, but simply appending context doesn't ensure grounded generation. The goal is to enhance grounding without compromising performance.

Method: Proposes CINGS: trains models with context prepended to responses, computes loss only over response tokens (masking context). Evaluated on 11 text datasets and vision-language benchmarks.

Result: CINGS outperforms other methods in text grounding and reduces hallucinations in vision-language tasks while maintaining factual consistency. No degradation in downstream performance.

Conclusion: CINGS effectively shifts model behavior to rely more on external context, improving grounding across domains without harming general capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

*Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi,Xiaodan Zhu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARE is a framework for efficient, high-quality automated process annotation in LLMs, improving reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Introduces SPARE, a structured framework for single-pass, per-step annotation using reference-guided evaluation.

Result: Improves reasoning performance and efficiency, achieving competitive results with 2.6x greater efficiency.

Conclusion: SPARE is effective for process supervision and offers significant efficiency gains, with code and models released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [33] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for hyperbole and metaphor detection, outperforming baselines with significant F1 score improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook emotional and associative aspects of hyperbole and metaphor, limiting detection accuracy.

Method: EmoBi integrates emotion analysis, domain mapping, and bidirectional dynamic interaction for improved detection.

Result: Achieves 28.1% and 23.1% F1 score improvements on hyperbole and metaphor datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: EmoBi effectively advances hyperbole and metaphor detection by leveraging emotion and dynamic interaction.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

### [34] [Lessons from Training Grounded LLMs with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15522)
*Shang Hong Sim,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,Hai Leong Chieu,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Navonil Majumder,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning to improve grounding in large language models (LLMs), achieving better performance in generating accurate, well-cited responses and handling unanswerable queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating grounded and trustworthy responses in LLMs, especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios where models often fail to cite correctly or refuse valid evidence.

Method: Uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) for training with outcome-based rewards (answer correctness, citation sufficiency, refusal quality) and a two-stage training setup. Also revisits instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models outperform instruction-only variants, particularly in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. Combining GRPO with GPT-4 distillation enhances performance in long-form QA tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL are valuable for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [35] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION improves local-global attention models by integrating linear attention for out-of-window tokens, achieving better efficiency and performance with smaller windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of local attention ignoring out-of-window tokens, aiming to shift the Pareto frontier for efficiency gains in short-context scenarios.

Method: Proposes RATTENTION, combining local attention with a specialized linear attention mechanism to capture out-of-window information.

Result: RATTENTION with a 512 window size matches full-attention performance, enhances long-context performance, and maintains training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION offers a superior tradeoff between performance and efficiency, validated by pretraining experiments and benchmarks.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*John X. Morris,Junjie Oscar Yin,Woojeong Kim,Vitaly Shmatikov,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gradient-based method to approximate training data from model weights, improving model performance using selected public data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data, creating a need to approximate data from weights.

Method: A gradient-based approach selects high-matching data from a public corpus to recover useful data from model weights.

Result: The method improves performance from 65% to 80% on AG News and reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3 on MSMARCO.

Conclusion: The approach effectively recovers useful data from weights, nearing expert benchmarks without access to true training data.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

*Shufan Li,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Predictive Generation (PredGen) to reduce latency in LLM-based voice chat by generating candidate responses while the user is still speaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latency in LLM-based voice chat due to slow first-sentence generation degrades user experience, especially on consumer hardware.

Method: Proposes PredGen, a framework using speculative decoding to generate responses during user input, enabling faster TTS processing.

Result: Simulated experiments show PredGen reduces latency by ~2x with minimal added computation.

Conclusion: PredGen effectively mitigates latency in LLM voice chat without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI) to evaluate gender fairness in LLMs, covering binary and non-binary genders, and assesses 22 models, revealing significant inclusivity variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive metrics for evaluating gender inclusivity in LLMs, especially beyond binary distinctions.

Method: Developed GIFI, a multi-level evaluation metric, and tested it on 22 LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities.

Result: Found significant variations in gender inclusivity among the models, highlighting existing biases.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for improving LLM inclusivity and provides a benchmark for future gender fairness advancements.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve foundation models' ability to verify claims in multimodal scientific literature.

Method: SciVer includes 3,000 expert-annotated examples from 1,113 papers, covering four reasoning types. Performance of 21 models is evaluated.

Result: A significant performance gap exists between models and human experts. RAG and error analysis highlight limitations in current models.

Conclusion: SciVer provides insights to enhance multimodal scientific claim verification, addressing critical model limitations.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of

*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSG, a task for discourse-level text scene graph parsing, and proposes DiscoSG-Refiner, a method to improve parsing efficiency and accuracy over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene graph parsers fail to handle multi-sentence descriptions effectively, missing cross-sentence phenomena like coreference, leading to fragmented graphs and poor VLM performance.

Method: The authors create DiscoSG-DS, a dataset for discourse-level parsing, and propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which uses two small PLMs to draft and refine graphs iteratively.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by ~30% over baselines, is 86x faster than GPT-4, and enhances downstream VLM tasks.

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner offers a scalable and efficient solution for discourse-level scene graph parsing, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WikiMixQA is a new benchmark with 1,000 MCQs for evaluating cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts from Wikipedia. It highlights challenges in long-context, multi-modal reasoning, with proprietary models like GPT-4-o outperforming open-source ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating complex cross-modal reasoning in document understanding, especially with long-context inputs.

Method: Introduces WikiMixQA, a dataset of 1,000 MCQs based on tables and charts from 4,000 Wikipedia pages across seven topics. Evaluates 12 vision-language models.

Result: Proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context but drop significantly with long-context retrieval. GPT-4-o leads with >50% accuracy, while open-source models max at 27%.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA is a vital benchmark for advancing document understanding, revealing the limitations of current models in long-context, multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI to automate MCQ creation in Portuguese, evaluating quality and reliability through expert reviews and student responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MCQ creation is time-consuming and costly, with limited focus on non-English languages and quality assessment of AI-generated MCQs.

Method: The study uses generative models to produce Portuguese MCQs, evaluates them via expert review and psychometric analysis of student responses.

Result: AI-generated MCQs match human-authored quality but face issues in semantic clarity, answerability, and distractor design.

Conclusion: Generative models show promise for MCQ automation in Portuguese, but challenges remain in ensuring high-quality distractors and clarity.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies regret in large language models, proposing methods to identify and analyze regret expressions and neurons, addressing dataset and metric challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding regret in LLMs enhances model reliability and reveals neural cognition coding.

Method: Proposes a workflow for regret dataset construction, S-CDI for optimal layer identification, and RDS/GIC for neuron analysis.

Result: Identified optimal regret layer with S-CDI, discovered M-shaped decoupling pattern, and categorized neurons into three functional groups.

Conclusion: The methods improve regret analysis in LLMs, offering insights into neural information processing and model reliability.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-cultural differences in interpreting intensifiers like 'quite' and 'very' between British and American English, attributing them to a mix of literal meaning variations and differing weights on utterance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether cross-cultural misunderstandings stem from literal word meanings or pragmatic factors like politeness and brevity.

Method: Three experiments and a computational cognitive model analyzing how British and American English speakers interpret intensifiers, incorporating recursive reasoning about informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: Cross-cultural differences arise from both literal meaning variations and differing weights on utterance cost, challenging purely semantic or politeness-based explanations.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural interpretation differences involve a complex interplay between literal meanings and pragmatic factors, not just one or the other.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following and compositional generalization by enforcing concept order in sentence generation. Analysis of 36 LLMs reveals biases and low diversity, with the best model achieving only 75% ordered coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to follow instructions and generalize compositionally by generating sentences with concepts in a specified order, addressing limitations in current benchmarks.

Method: Proposed Ordered CommonGen benchmark, measuring ordered coverage to evaluate LLMs' adherence to concept order and generalization. Tested 36 LLMs.

Result: LLMs show biases toward certain order patterns, leading to low-diversity outputs. The best model achieved ~75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in instruction-following and compositional generalization, as current performance is suboptimal.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CC-Learn, a reinforcement learning framework, improves LLM reasoning consistency by training on cohorts of similar questions, outperforming baselines in accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with consistent, robust reasoning, prompting the need for methods like CC-Learn to enhance reliability.

Method: CC-Learn uses a composite objective (cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, rejection penalty) optimized via reinforcement learning to enforce uniform reasoning patterns.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, StrategyQA) show CC-Learn boosts accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs, as demonstrated by CC-Learn's performance.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

### [48] [Leaky Thoughts: Large Reasoning Models Are Not Private Thinkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15674)
*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Privacy leakage in reasoning traces of large models reveals sensitive data, exacerbated by test-time compute approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that reasoning traces are safe and highlight privacy risks in model internals.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations to assess leakage, focusing on test-time compute approaches like increased reasoning steps.

Result: More reasoning steps improve utility but increase privacy leakage, creating a tension between performance and safety.

Conclusion: Safety efforts must address internal model reasoning, not just outputs, to mitigate privacy risks.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

### [49] [Gender-Neutral Machine Translation Strategies in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15676)
*Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Chi-kiu Lo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of 21 MT systems shows poor handling of gender-neutral translations, with only a few systems adapting strategies based on target language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of preserving gender ambiguity in MT to avoid misgendering and representational harms, especially in grammatical gender languages.

Method: Assessed 21 MT systems for sensitivity to gender neutrality in three translation directions, categorized observed strategies, and examined binary gender stereotypes' impact.

Result: Most systems failed to provide gender-neutral translations, though a few used specific strategies depending on the target language.

Conclusion: Current MT systems largely lack gender-neutral translation capabilities, highlighting a need for improvement in handling gender ambiguity.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

*Byung-Kwan Lee,Ryo Hachiuma,Yong Man Ro,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GenRecal is a distillation framework for VLMs that addresses architectural diversity, enabling efficient knowledge transfer to smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large VLMs on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to computational demands, necessitating distillation into smaller models.

Method: GenRecal uses a Recalibrator to align feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs for effective knowledge transfer.

Result: GenRecal outperforms baseline and large-scale VLMs on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal provides a general-purpose solution for distilling VLMs, improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhantomHunter is a detector for text from privately-tuned LLMs, addressing performance drops in existing methods by focusing on family-level traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of privately-tuned LLMs has worsened issues like misinformation and academic misconduct, making detection crucial. Existing methods fail for privately-tuned models.

Method: PhantomHunter uses a family-aware learning framework to detect shared traits across base models and their derivatives, avoiding reliance on individual characteristics.

Result: Outperforms 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, achieving F1 scores over 96% on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter effectively detects text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs, offering a robust solution to a growing challenge.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

TL;DR: ViLLa is a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable animal monitoring, combining visual detection, language parsing, and symbolic reasoning to answer natural language queries about animal presence, count, and location.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent and modular system for monitoring animal populations by integrating visual data and human language queries, addressing the limitations of black-box models.

Method: ViLLa integrates a visual detection module, a language parser, and a symbolic reasoning layer to ground visual data into symbolic facts and apply logic-based inference for answering queries.

Result: The system successfully bridges visual content with structured queries, demonstrating accuracy in tasks involving animal imagery.

Conclusion: ViLLa offers a modular, interpretable solution for animal monitoring, outperforming black-box models in transparency and task-specific performance.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphGSOcc, a framework combining semantic and geometric graph Transformers for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, addressing feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities in 3DGS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D semantic occupancy prediction by addressing issues in existing 3DGS methods: unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations and boundary ambiguities due to lack of geometric constraints.

Method: Proposes GraphGSOcc with Dual Gaussians Graph Attention, dynamically constructing geometric and semantic graphs, and Multi-scale Graph Attention for fine and coarse-grained feature aggregation.

Result: Achieves 24.10% mIoU on SurroundOcc dataset, with 1.97% improvement and 13.7% memory reduction (6.1 GB GPU memory).

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc effectively enhances semantic and geometric feature aggregation, improving performance and efficiency in 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated videos necessitates reliable detection methods that go beyond binary classification, offering fine-grained evidence to convince users and auditors.

Method: DAVID-X pairs AI-generated videos with defect-level annotations and rationales. DAVID-XR1, a video-language model, uses these to provide interpretable reasoning (defect categorization, localization, and explanations).

Result: The model, fine-tuned on DAVID-X and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, generalizes well across various generators and modes.

Conclusion: Explainable detection methods like DAVID-XR1 promise trustworthy identification of AI-generated videos by making the process transparent and verifiable.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD introduces a novel DETR-based framework for monocular 3D detection, featuring Mask Separated Self-Attention, Variational Query Denoising, and a self-distillation strategy, achieving top performance on KITTI and nuScenes datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of DETR-like architectures in monocular 3D detection, which hinder optimal performance.

Method: Proposes three key innovations: Mask Separated Self-Attention for stable Hungarian matching, Variational Query Denoising to tackle gradient vanishing, and a self-distillation strategy for iterative refinement.

Result: MonoVQD outperforms on the KITTI benchmark and generalizes well to multi-view 3D detection on nuScenes.

Conclusion: MonoVQD advances monocular 3D detection with robust performance and broad applicability, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartIR, an iterative refinement method for improving chart-to-code generation in MLLMs by using structured instructions and a two-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on chart-to-code tasks due to the complexity of translating visual elements into structured code.

Method: ChartIR uses structured instructions (description and difference) for visual understanding and a two-stage pipeline (initial code generation and iterative refinement).

Result: ChartIR outperforms other methods on models like Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances chart-to-code generation by leveraging structured instructions and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

TL;DR: PictSure is an ICL framework for few-shot image classification, focusing on optimizing image embeddings to improve out-of-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the overlooked role of image embeddings in ICL-based FSIC pipelines to enhance generalization in data-scarce domains.

Method: Systematic analysis of visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies to optimize embedding models.

Result: PictSure outperforms existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks while maintaining in-domain performance.

Conclusion: The success of ICL-based FSIC heavily depends on embedding model pretraining, and PictSure demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

### [64] [Finding Optimal Kernel Size and Dimension in Convolutional Neural Networks An Architecture Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14846)
*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BKSEF, a framework for optimal kernel size selection in CNNs, improving accuracy and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size in CNNs is often overlooked but impacts performance. BKSEF addresses this by optimizing kernel size layer-wise.

Method: BKSEF integrates information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to balance information gain, efficiency, and accuracy.

Result: Experiments show up to 3.1% accuracy improvement and 42.8% FLOPs reduction. Case studies confirm practical benefits.

Conclusion: BKSEF proves kernel size is optimizable, offering theoretical and practical support for efficient CNN designs.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

*Varun Mannam,Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method automates key-frame identification and annotation in retail videos, reducing manual effort and costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual video annotation in retail is time-consuming and costly, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: Uses deep neural networks for key-frame identification and object detection tailored to retail environments.

Result: Achieves human-level accuracy, reduces annotation costs by 2x, and requires minimal human verification (less than 5%).

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves efficiency and cost-effectiveness in retail video annotation, benefiting various retail applications.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UPNet, a lightweight neural network for active view selection (AVS) in 3D reconstruction, predicting uncertainty maps to efficiently select informative viewpoints, achieving comparable accuracy with fewer views and significant computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying the minimal set of views for accurate 3D reconstruction motivates the development of a more efficient and generalizable AVS method.

Method: UPNet predicts uncertainty maps from a single input image, leveraging heuristics to select informative viewpoints. Aggregated uncertainty maps suppress redundancy, and selected views train 3D neural rendering models.

Result: The method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy with half the viewpoints, a 400x speedup, and over 50% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage. It generalizes to novel object categories without additional training.

Conclusion: UPNet offers a scalable, efficient, and generalizable solution for AVS in 3D reconstruction, outperforming baseline methods in speed and resource usage.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, enhancing alignment via hybrid loss, kernelized representations, and divergence selection. It also presents DETONATE, a benchmark for social bias, and AQI for measuring alignment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve alignment in T2I models, ensuring they capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness, by extending DPO techniques from LLMs.

Method: DPO-Kernels integrate hybrid loss, kernelized representations (RBF, Polynomial, Wavelet), and divergence selection (Wasserstein, R'enyi). DETONATE benchmark and AQI measure are introduced.

Result: DPO-Kernels show improved alignment and robustness, with empirical validation via HT-SR. DETONATE provides a large-scale bias benchmark.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels effectively enhance T2I alignment, and DETONATE serves as a valuable resource for evaluating fairness and safety in generative models.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

*Yizhen Zhang,Yang Ding,Shuoshuo Zhang,Xinchen Zhang,Haoling Li,Zhong-zhi Li,Peijie Wang,Jie Wu,Lei Ji,Yelong Shen,Yujiu Yang,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PeRL is a reinforcement learning approach for interleaved multimodal tasks, improving learning efficiency and performance on multi-image benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for vision-language models struggle with multi-image positional reasoning, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Introduces permutation of image sequences for diversity and a rollout filtering mechanism for effective policy exploitation.

Result: PeRL outperforms baselines on multi-image benchmarks while maintaining performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: PeRL addresses limitations in multimodal RL, achieving state-of-the-art results in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

*Xinkai Zhao,Yuta Tokuoka,Junichiro Iwasawa,Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on medical image diffusion models, outperforming existing methods by focusing on mid-frequency reconstruction errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in medical imaging by improving the accuracy of MIAs on diffusion models, which struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction and inherent image difficulty.

Method: Analyzes the reverse diffusion process, computes mid-frequency reconstruction error, and uses structural similarity index scores to determine membership.

Result: FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods on medical image datasets.

Conclusion: FCRE effectively mitigates confounding factors in MIAs for medical images, enhancing privacy risk quantification.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision Transformer (ViT) and hybrid ViT-CNN models for quark-gluon jet classification, showing they outperform CNNs in accuracy and other metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving jet tagging in high-energy physics is crucial for new physics searches and precision measurements at the LHC. ViTs' potential for this task is underexplored.

Method: Uses simulated 2012 CMS Open Data to construct multi-channel jet-view images from energy deposits and tracks, evaluating ViT and hybrid models.

Result: ViT-based models, especially hybrids like ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt, outperform CNNs in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework and benchmarks for using ViTs in jet classification, with a dataset for future research.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two models (LRCN and Transformer-based) using RGB tactile images from GelSight for accurate compliance prediction, outperforming baselines and highlighting challenges with harder objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance detection methods lack portability, scalability, and accuracy, while existing neural network approaches still underperform.

Method: Two models (LRCN and Transformer) are developed, leveraging RGB tactile images from GelSight to predict compliance metrics.

Result: The models show significant performance improvement over baselines, with harder objects posing greater estimation challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed models effectively improve compliance estimation, though harder objects remain difficult to predict accurately.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALETTE is an end-to-end text spotter for historical maps, addressing challenges in text extraction with a hyper-local sampling module and synthetic training data (SynthMap+). It outperforms SOTA methods and has been deployed on 60,000+ maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps contain valuable georeferenced text, but extraction is hindered by lack of effective methods and training data, especially for varied map styles and complex text instances.

Method: PALETTE uses a hyper-local sampling module for precise feature learning and introduces SynthMap+ for synthetic training data generation.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on benchmark datasets, especially for long and angled text, and has processed 60,000+ maps.

Conclusion: PALETTE effectively addresses historical map text extraction challenges, demonstrating superior performance and scalability for large collections.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer is a unified framework for style transfer, addressing traditional issues and enabling artist-level results. It uses semantic-based style injection, human feedback for data augmentation, and a training-free triple diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional style transfer methods and unify frameworks for diverse tasks, enabling high-quality, artist-level style transfer and text-driven stylization.

Method: 1. Semantic-based style injection using BLIP and CLIP space. 2. Data augmentation with human feedback. 3. Training-free triple diffusion process for feature manipulation.

Result: Achieves high-quality style transfer, preserves original content, and introduces image color editing during the process.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer revolutionizes style transfer with a unified, efficient framework, delivering artist-level results and novel capabilities like text-driven stylization and color editing.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

TL;DR: The paper addresses training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization by using Wasserstein distance to align feature and code vector distributions, achieving high codebook utilization and reduced quantization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector quantization methods suffer from training instability and codebook collapse due to mismatched distributions of features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and information loss.

Method: The authors employ the Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of features and code vectors, ensuring better representation and utilization.

Result: The approach achieves near 100% codebook utilization and significantly reduces quantization error, validated empirically and theoretically.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates training instability and codebook collapse, improving the performance of autoregressive models.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: SynPo improves few-shot medical image segmentation by enhancing negative prompts in LVMs like SAM, using a Confidence Map Synergy Module and K-means clustering for point selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free LVMs underperform on low-contrast medical images due to ineffective use of negative prompts.

Method: SynPo combines DINOv2 and SAM for reliable confidence maps, selects top-k positive and Gaussian-distributed negative points, and applies K-means clustering for high-quality prompts.

Result: SynPo matches state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods in performance.

Conclusion: SynPo effectively leverages negative prompts in LVMs, achieving strong segmentation results without training.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) to improve point cloud analysis by addressing irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gaps, enhancing computational efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aggregating local structures in point clouds suffer from irrelevant point interference, feature hierarchy gaps, high computational overhead, and noise sensitivity.

Method: PDSA corrects feature distribution using high-dimensional correlations, employs a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and optimizes computational overhead with a key point mechanism.

Result: PDSA achieves significant performance improvements in semantic segmentation and classification tasks with less parameter cost, as validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed PDSA module effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, demonstrating improved efficiency, robustness, and generalization in point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

TL;DR: Echo-DND, a dual-noise diffusion model, improves LV segmentation in noisy echocardiograms by combining Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, multi-scale fusion, and spatial coherence calibration, outperforming SOTA models with Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LV segmentation in noisy, low-contrast echocardiograms is critical for diagnostics but challenging due to ambiguous boundaries.

Method: Echo-DND uses Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, a multi-scale fusion module, and spatial coherence calibration for precise segmentation.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.962 (CAMUS) and 0.939 (EchoNet-Dynamic), outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: Echo-DND sets a new standard for echocardiogram segmentation and shows potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

*Ziling Huang,Yidan Zhang,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSeDis unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding for large-scale visual search, addressing both retrieval and localization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on retrieval or localization, but not both, leading to incomplete solutions for visual search engines.

Method: Introduces Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), a task combining retrieval and grounding, with a benchmark and metric for evaluation.

Result: A zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model shows potential, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: ReSeDis provides a realistic testbed for robust, scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

*Alessio Negrini,Simon Reiß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores training generalist models for retinal OCT using visual in-context learning (VICL) to enable task flexibility without task-specific development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized models are limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and resources, while generalist models offer adaptability for practitioners.

Method: The study uses VICL to train models for retinal OCT, allowing generalization across tasks with few examples at inference time.

Result: A broad evaluation protocol for VICL in OCT is proposed, and a state-of-the-art VICL approach is tested on multiple datasets, establishing a baseline.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential and limitations of VICL for OCT, with open-source code released to encourage further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

*Xuelin Shen,Jiayin Xu,Kangsheng Yin,Wenhan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC) to protect images from exploitation by vision-language models while maintaining compression functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard user privacy against advanced vision-language models by embedding defenses in image compression.

Method: Introduces PSIC with a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation module and Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented optimization, enabling flexible decoding.

Result: Effective protection against semantic exploitation while preserving image quality and compression utility.

Conclusion: PSIC is a versatile, plug-and-play solution for privacy-aware image compression.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

*Dan He,Weisheng Li,Guofen Wang,Yuping Huang,Shiqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) for multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF), addressing limitations in feature capture and cross-modal interaction to enhance fused image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods struggle with detailed feature capture and cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused images.

Method: A two-stage approach: Stage I uses a diffusion process with UNet for image reconstruction, while Stage II inputs noisy images into a fusion network with adaptive modules for different modalities.

Result: The method excels in objective metrics, producing fused images with balanced brightness, color, contrast, and detail.

Conclusion: DM-FNet improves MMIF quality by leveraging diffusion models and adaptive fusion, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Motivation: Enhancing video understanding by generating detailed and accurate natural language descriptions for videos with paired audio.

Method: Proposes video-SALMONN 2 with LoRA and DPO, introduces MrDPO for training, and new metrics for evaluation.

Result: Reduces captioning error rates by 28%, outperforms leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, and maintains competitive performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2 is a highly effective model for video captioning, leveraging advanced techniques like MrDPO and LoRA to achieve state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

TL;DR: The paper proposes C-AFBiFPN, a feature enhancement and fusion framework for SAR ship detection, addressing challenges like scale variations and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR ship detection struggles with scale variations, noise, and complex backgrounds, necessitating improved feature representation and fusion.

Method: C-AFBiFPN introduces a Convolutional Feature Enhancement module and integrates BiFormer attention into BiFPN for better feature fusion.

Result: Experiments on SSDD show improved accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and multi-scale adaptability.

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN effectively enhances SAR ship detection by improving feature representation and fusion.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RA-NeRF improves camera pose prediction for 3D reconstruction, outperforming existing methods on complex trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurate camera pose estimation, especially for complex trajectories, limiting 3D reconstruction quality.

Method: RA-NeRF combines NeRF with photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation, and an implicit pose filter for robust pose estimation.

Result: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF effectively handles complex camera trajectories, enhancing 3D reconstruction accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

*Chenxi Zhang,Jiayun Wu,Qing Zhang,Yazhe Zhai,Youwei Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RetroMem, a recall-augmented COD architecture that dynamically integrates historical knowledge to improve camouflage object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack mechanisms for historical context, limiting their effectiveness in complex camouflage scenes.

Method: RetroMem uses a two-stage training paradigm (learning and recall) with DMA for multi-scale feature capture and DMM with IPR for dynamic memory integration.

Result: RetroMem outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances COD by leveraging historical context and dynamic memory, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High demand and competition in semiconductors necessitate faster time-to-market and quality, where DA can reduce manual re-labeling and computational costs.

Method: The study tests DA in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings, introducing DBACS, a CycleGAN-inspired model with enhanced loss terms.

Result: The approaches are validated on real-world Electron Microscope images, demonstrating improved performance in DA for semiconductor applications.

Conclusion: The DBACS approach advances DA techniques, proving effective for semiconductor defect classification.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world

TL;DR: MSNeRV improves video compression using implicit neural representations (INRs) by addressing detail and motion challenges with multi-scale feature fusion, temporal windows, and adaptive loss functions, outperforming VTM-23.7 in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based methods fail to handle detail-intensive and fast-changing video content due to underutilized network features and lack of video-specific design.

Method: Proposes MSNeRV, featuring temporal windows for consistency, GoP-level grids for background, a multi-scale spatial decoder, and a scale-adaptive loss function.

Result: MSNeRV outperforms INR-based methods and VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in compression efficiency for dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: MSNeRV advances INR-based video compression by effectively addressing detail and motion challenges, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Result: BCRNet outperforms existing methods on L3D and P2ILF datasets, showing significant improvements.

Conclusion: BCRNet is a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation through precise landmark detection in laparoscopic images.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Conclusion: ViMAT offers a flexible, marker-free solution for industrial assembly monitoring, validated in practical settings.

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ME analysis methods treat spotting and recognition separately, which is inefficient for real-world applications. The emergence of multimodal models offers new opportunities for integrated and enhanced ME analysis.

Method: The paper introduces two tasks: ME-STR (unified spotting and recognition pipeline) and ME-VQA (visual question answering using multimodal models).

Result: The tasks aim to improve ME analysis by leveraging multimodal reasoning, with performance evaluated on a leaderboard.

Conclusion: The MEGC 2025 challenge encourages innovative approaches to ME analysis, integrating spotting, recognition, and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating

Motivation: Traditional Active Learning (AL) methods assume closed-set scenarios and waste labeling costs in open-set environments with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. OpenPath addresses this inefficiency.

Method: OpenPath uses task-specific prompts in the first query to select In-Distribution (ID) samples. Subsequent queries employ Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) with Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) to ensure purity and informativeness.

Result: OpenPath outperforms state-of-the-art open-set AL methods on two public pathology datasets, enhancing model performance by selecting high-purity samples.

Conclusion: OpenPath effectively reduces labeling costs and improves efficiency in open-set scenarios for pathology image classification.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountVid, a model for open-world object counting in videos, leveraging image-based counting and video segmentation. It also presents the VideoCount dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task aims to count unique object instances in videos based on text or image prompts, addressing challenges like occlusions and similar objects.

Method: CountVid combines an image-based counting model with a promptable video segmentation and tracking model.

Result: CountVid outperforms baselines, providing accurate object counts on the VideoCount dataset.

Conclusion: The model and dataset are publicly available, demonstrating effective open-world object counting in videos.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-aware texture mapping method improves animal re-identification by unwarping deformable fur patterns into a canonical UV space, enhancing feature matching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing re-identification methods struggle with deformable fur or skin patterns due to geometric distortions from body movement.

Method: Proposes a geometry-aware texture mapping approach using surface normal estimation to unwarp pelage patterns into UV space, preserving geometric consistency.

Result: Achieves up to 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy for Saimaa ringed seals and leopards.

Conclusion: The method enhances robustness in re-identification without requiring ground truth UV annotations, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse poses.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

*Yujin Kim,Hyunsoo Kim,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDIS introduces a diffusion-assisted method for data-free image synthesis, leveraging a text-to-image diffusion model and domain alignment guidance to improve synthetic image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFIS methods produce samples deviating from the training data distribution due to lack of natural image priors. DDIS aims to address this by incorporating diffusion models as priors.

Method: DDIS uses a text-to-image diffusion model as a prior, introduces Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) for domain alignment, and optimizes a Class Alignment Token (CAT) for class-specific attributes.

Result: DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods on PACS and ImageNet, generating samples that better align with the training data distribution.

Conclusion: DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance in data-free image synthesis by effectively leveraging diffusion models and alignment techniques.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NERO, a novel OOD scoring mechanism for medical imaging that leverages neuron-level relevance and clustering to improve OOD detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability in deep learning for medical imaging is critical, and current OOD detection methods may not fully capture OOD diversity, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: NERO clusters neuron-level relevance for in-distribution classes, uses a relevance distance metric, and incorporates scaled relevance and feature norms to enhance OOD separability.

Result: NERO achieves improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks (Kvasir and GastroVision).

Conclusion: NERO provides a more reliable and explainable OOD detection framework, enhancing model reliability in medical imaging.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Conclusion: MRG-LLM effectively integrates LLMs with medical imaging, offering precise and targeted report generation.

Abstract: Medical report generation from imaging data remains a challenging task in
clinical practice. While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in
addressing this challenge, their effective integration with medical imaging
data still deserves in-depth exploration. In this paper, we present MRG-LLM, a
novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines a frozen LLM with a

tailored to individual medical images through conditional affine
transformations derived from visual features. We propose two implementations:
prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization, enabling precise and targeted

TL;DR: GenHOI is a two-stage framework for synthesizing high-fidelity 4D human-object interactions (HOI) and generalizing to unseen objects, using Object-AnchorNet and ContactDM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited large-scale 4D HOI datasets for text-driven human motion synthesis.

Method: 1) Object-AnchorNet reconstructs sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects. 2) ContactDM interpolates these into 4D HOI sequences, using a Contact-Aware Encoder and HOI Attention.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, with strong generalization to unseen objects.

Conclusion: GenHOI effectively synthesizes high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences and generalizes well, reducing reliance on large 4D datasets.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

TL;DR: CLAIM introduces a framework for synthesizing realistic myocardial scar images using clinical knowledge and diffusion models, improving segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability and variability of high-quality labeled LGE images hinder robust scar segmentation model development.

Method: CLAIM uses the SMILE module for scar synthesis guided by the AHA 17-segment model and employs joint training of generator and segmentation networks.

Result: CLAIM generates anatomically coherent scars and outperforms baselines in Dice similarity for scar segmentation.

Conclusion: CLAIM enables controllable, realistic scar synthesis and enhances downstream medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet eliminates dense LiDAR supervision for radar-based depth estimation, using sparse LiDAR to achieve comparable results with only 1% supervision density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dense LiDAR supervision is costly and data-intensive, prompting the need for a more efficient method.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates sparse radar points to create depth priors, guiding monocular depth prediction without dense labels.

Result: Outperforms dense-supervised methods, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, with clearer object contours and textures.

Conclusion: RaCalNet offers a cost-effective, efficient alternative to dense supervision, improving accuracy and detail in depth estimation.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,

TL;DR: WinWinLay is a training-free method for Layout-to-Image generation, improving control precision and realism via Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-Image diffusion models struggle with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts in Layout-to-Image tasks.

Method: Proposes Non-local Attention Energy Function to address spatial biases and Adaptive Update (Langevin dynamics-based) to prevent out-of-distribution artifacts.

Result: WinWinLay outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precise element placement and photorealistic fidelity.

Conclusion: WinWinLay effectively enhances control and realism in Layout-to-Image generation without additional training.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in ultra-high spatial resolution land cover classification, such as high annotation costs, scale variation, and limited adaptability of large-scale models.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised segmentation framework using SAM2 knowledge and a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter for fine-grained detail modeling.

Result: Achieves a 1.78% improvement over parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain over state-of-the-art high-resolution segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages unlabeled data and maintains lightweight design, delivering robust segmentation with superior structural consistency.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### [107] [One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15591)
*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DLoRAL, a Dual LoRA Learning paradigm for Real-VSR, combining Cross-Frame Retrieval and LoRA modules to enhance spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often sacrifice spatial details for temporal coherence, leading to suboptimal visual quality. The goal is to balance both aspects effectively.

Method: DLoRAL uses a Cross-Frame Retrieval module and two LoRA branches (Consistency-LoRA and Detail-LoRA) trained iteratively to enhance details while preserving temporal coherence.

Result: DLoRAL achieves strong performance in accuracy and speed, producing detail-rich and temporally consistent outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the trade-off between spatial details and temporal consistency in Real-VSR, offering high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

### [108] [Mono-Modalizing Extremely Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15596)
*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2M-Reg is a novel framework for multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR) that uses mono-modal similarity, improving alignment for highly disparate modalities like PET-MRI and FA-MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DIR methods struggle with highly heterogeneous modalities due to unreliable similarity metrics, leading to distorted images.

Method: Proposes M2M-Reg, which trains DIR models using mono-modal similarity, and GradCyCon, a regularizer for diffeomorphism. Extends to semi-supervised settings without ground-truth transformations.

Result: Achieves up to 2x higher Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) than prior methods on the ADNI dataset for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg effectively handles highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR, offering seamless integration into existing models and superior performance.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction-free online framework for open-vocabulary 3D object detection, leveraging pre-trained models and multi-view fusion for real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational and memory constraints in existing 3D detection methods by eliminating dense point cloud reconstruction.

Method: Uses Cubify Anything and CLIP for single-view detection, with multi-view fusion via association and optimization modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets, enabling real-time detection in large environments.

Conclusion: The framework offers efficient, real-time 3D detection with strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi is a text-driven diffusion framework for realistic human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis, optimizing noise space for both realism and physical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI generation is challenging due to strict contact accuracy and diverse motion requirements; existing methods compromise between realism and correctness.

Method: Uses Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) in a pretrained diffusion model, splitting the problem into object-centric (contact) and human-centric (motion) phases.

Result: Outperforms prior works in contact accuracy, physical validity, and quality on the GRAB dataset, enabling complex interactions via text prompts.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi achieves precise, natural HOI synthesis, demonstrating controllable interactions like grasping and full-body coordination.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

*Karmesh Yadav,Yusuf Ali,Gunshi Gupta,Yarin Gal,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator is introduced to evaluate memory-based capabilities in robotics, addressing limitations of current VLMs in handling long-term experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with long-term memory in embodied settings, and existing benchmarks lack focus on embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation.

Method: The benchmark includes 60 tasks in the Habitat simulator, procedurally extendable for scalable evaluation. Baselines integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with navigation policies.

Result: The benchmark assesses VLMs' performance on memory-intensive tasks, identifying areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for better memory integration in embodied agents and provides a scalable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

TL;DR: MLLMs perform better with degraded images, contrary to human perception. VQ-TTT, a lightweight adaptation module, improves accuracy by dynamically adjusting image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual quality affects MLLM performance and address the paradox where degraded images improve results.

Method: Systematic study with controlled image degradations and stylistic shifts, introducing VQ-TTT to adaptively adjust image quality.

Result: VQ-TTT improves accuracy across MLLMs and datasets without extra data or models, showing degraded images can enhance performance.

Conclusion: MLLMs prefer adaptive, not universally clean, imagery, redefining visual input quality for AI.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR is a two-stage inference framework for VLMs that improves efficiency and output fidelity by combining value-guided search with margin-based rewards, achieving faster and more reliable captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiency and low-confidence generations in existing VLM inference methods, which lead to persistent hallucinations.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) single-pass selection of highest-value caption, (2) selective refinement of weak segments with margin-based penalty.

Result: ViMaR generates more reliable, accurate, and detailed captions with 4x speedup, and generalizes to unseen models.

Conclusion: ViMaR is scalable, transferable, and enhances VLM performance, showing potential for self-improving pipelines.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

TL;DR: A novel joint approach for image/video relighting using video diffusion models, improving generalization and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of existing relighting methods, which struggle with data scarcity, error accumulation, and realism.

Method: Jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in one pass using video diffusion models, trained on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in visual fidelity and temporal consistency, with strong generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances relighting by combining implicit scene understanding and generative capabilities.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sekai, a high-quality first-person video dataset for world exploration, addressing limitations of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack diversity and annotations for world exploration, limiting training effectiveness.

Method: Sekai includes 5,000+ hours of videos from 100+ countries, annotated with location, weather, and more. A toolbox was developed for collection and annotation.

Result: Experiments confirm dataset quality. A subset trained YUME, an interactive video exploration model.

Conclusion: Sekai advances video generation and world exploration, enabling valuable applications.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: ECAD introduces a genetic algorithm for efficient caching in diffusion models, improving speed and quality without modifying network parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are slow and computationally expensive; existing caching methods are rigid and lack generalization.

Method: ECAD uses a genetic algorithm to learn per-model caching schedules, forming a Pareto frontier with minimal calibration prompts.

Result: ECAD achieves significant speedups (e.g., 2.58x on PixArt-alpha) and better quality (4.47 FID improvement) across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable, generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion models, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Motivation: To evaluate how well LLMs replicate human behavior in social science research, especially in contentious survey settings.

Method: A quantitative framework using hypothesis testing to compare LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice surveys.

Result: The tested LLM poorly simulates human opinions and behaviors, especially for contentious questions across diverse sub-populations.

Conclusion: LLMs may not align well with human behaviors in social science research, necessitating improved practices for their use.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Conclusion: The OCR-based speech synthesis system offers an effective alternative for visually impaired individuals to access books independently.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually

TL;DR: SonicVerse is a multi-task music captioning model that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection to produce detailed captions for music pieces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich music databases and advance music AI research by generating accurate and detailed captions for music pieces.

Method: Uses a projection-based architecture to transform audio into language tokens while detecting music features via auxiliary heads, enhancing captioning input.

Result: Incorporating music features improves caption quality and detail, enabling time-informed descriptions for longer pieces.

Conclusion: SonicVerse effectively combines music feature detection with caption generation, enhancing the richness and accuracy of music descriptions.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

TL;DR: Passive acoustic monitoring uses ARUs to record wildlife sounds, requiring automated detection for large datasets. pycnet-audio, built around PNW-Cnet, offers a workflow for processing such data, detecting vocalizations of 80+ species and noise types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient processing of large acoustic datasets from wildlife monitoring, as manual review is impractical.

Method: Deploy ARUs to record audio, then use pycnet-audio with PNW-Cnet for automated detection of target signals (vocalizations, noise).

Result: PNW-Cnet detects vocalizations of ~80 species and various noise types, providing a scalable solution.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio and PNW-Cnet enable practical, automated analysis of large acoustic datasets for wildlife research.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls

### [121] [Factorized RVQ-GAN For Disentangled Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15456)
*Sameer Khurana,Dominik Klement,Antoine Laurent,Dominik Bobos,Juraj Novosad,Peter Gazdik,Ellen Zhang,Zili Huang,Amir Hussein,Ricard Marxer,Yoshiki Masuyama,Ryo Aihara,Chiori Hori,Francois G. Germain,Gordon Wichern,Jonathan Le Roux*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: HAC is a neural speech codec with a hierarchical bottleneck (acoustic, phonetic, lexical) using knowledge distillation for disentangled tokens, outperforming baselines in naturalness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified neural speech codec that bridges acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream tasks.

Method: HAC uses a hierarchical bottleneck with three linguistic levels and leverages knowledge distillation from HuBERT (phoneme-level) and LaBSE (lexical-level).

Result: HAC produces disentangled tokens aligning with phonemes and word-level semantics, outperforming single-level baselines in naturalness and reconstruction.

Conclusion: HAC is a promising unified discrete speech representation for speech generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The Pro3 is effective for large-scale 3D modeling, offering a balance of cost and performance, and benefits from LiDAR and advanced alignment techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Matterport Pro3, a
consumer-grade 3D scanning device, for large-scale environment reconstruction.
We conduct detailed scanning (1,099 scanning points) of a six-floor building
(17,567 square meters) and assess the device's effectiveness, limitations, and
performance enhancements in diverse scenarios. Challenges encountered during
the scanning are addressed through proposed solutions, while we also explore
advanced methods to overcome them more effectively. Comparative analysis with
another consumer-grade device (iPhone) highlights the Pro3's balance between
cost-effectiveness and performance. The Matterport Pro3 achieves a denser point
cloud with 1,877,324 points compared to the iPhone's 506,961 points and higher
alignment accuracy with an RMSE of 0.0118 meters. The cloud-to-cloud (C2C)
average distance error between the two point cloud models is 0.0408 meters,
with a standard deviation of 0.0715 meters. The study demonstrates the Pro3's
ability to generate high-quality 3D models suitable for large-scale

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning-based solution for real-time Diabetic Retinopathy detection on edge devices, achieving high accuracy and efficiency with optimized models like MobileNet and SqueezeNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DR diagnosis is manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, necessitating an automated, scalable solution for early detection, especially in remote settings.

Method: Multiple CNNs (MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, custom DNN) were trained on a curated dataset of retinal fundus images, optimized for edge deployment using TensorFlowLite and 8-bit quantization.

Result: MobileNet achieved 96.45% accuracy, while SqueezeNet showed strong real-time performance (176 KB size, 17 ms latency). Models were efficient on various edge devices.

Conclusion: Edge AI offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, particularly beneficial in resource-constrained healthcare environments.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

### [124] [Improving Prostate Gland Segmenting Using Transformer based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14844)
*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Transformer models (SwinUNETR and UNETR) outperform 3D UNet in prostate gland segmentation, handling inter-reader variability and domain shift better, with SwinUNETR showing superior robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of inter-reader variability and cross-site domain shift in prostate MRI segmentation by evaluating transformer models.

Method: Compared UNETR and SwinUNETR against 3D UNet using three training strategies (single cohort, cross-validated mixed cohort, gland size-based) on 546 annotated MRI volumes. Hyperparameters tuned with Optuna.

Result: SwinUNETR achieved higher Dice scores (up to 0.902) than UNETR and 3D UNet, especially in gland size-based subsets, demonstrating reduced sensitivity to label noise and class imbalance.

Conclusion: SwinUNETR's global and shifted-window self-attention improves segmentation robustness, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on facial images, was fine-tuned for age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival), outperforming benchmarks and showing clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop noninvasive facial biomarkers for biological age estimation and survival risk prediction using a scalable foundation model.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning on public and cancer patient datasets, with robustness testing and clinical validation using Cox models.

Result: FAHR-FaceAge achieved a mean absolute error of 5.1 years and improved survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival predicted mortality robustly, with a hazard ratio of 3.22 for high-risk patients. Both models generalized well.

Conclusion: A single foundation model can provide scalable, accurate facial biomarkers for aging and mortality risk, enhancing prognostic accuracy.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

*Paula Feldman,Miguel Fainstein,Viviana Siless,Claudio Delrieux,Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) is developed to generate diverse and accurate 3D blood vessel models, overcoming limitations of rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate representation of anatomical trees is challenging due to their complex topology and geometry. Existing rule-based methods lack diversity and realism.

Method: The RvNN learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity and geometry features, enabling generation of new vessel geometries.

Result: Generated 3D vessel models closely resemble real data in terms of radii, length, and tortuosity, even for aneurysms.

Conclusion: This work is the first to use RvNN for blood vessel synthesis, offering potential for medical training and simulations.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework is proposed to enhance neurological disorder diagnosis by integrating multi-modal MRI and clinical data, achieving 82.47% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL methods fail to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance in diagnosing neurological disorders.

Method: A transformer-based MoE framework is introduced, using modality-specific experts and adaptive fusion to integrate multi-modal MRI (aMRI, DTI, fMRI) and clinical data.

Result: The framework achieves 82.47% validation accuracy, outperforming baselines by over 10%, especially in distinguishing overlapping disease states.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates significant potential for improving ND diagnosis through multi-modal learning in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

*Boah Kim,Tejas Sudharshan Mathai,Kimberly Helm,Peter A. Pinto,Ronald M. Summers*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (DenseNet-121) is developed to classify 8 body mpMRI series types, achieving high accuracy (0.972) and outperforming other models. It performs well even with limited training data and on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorrect DICOM headers in mpMRI exams due to diverse protocols and technologist errors hinder radiologists' efficiency. A reliable classification method is needed.

Method: Multiple deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet) are trained and compared using mpMRI data from various institutions. DenseNet-121 is identified as the best performer.

Result: DenseNet-121 achieves the highest F1-score (0.966) and accuracy (0.972). It maintains high accuracy (>0.95) with over 729 training studies and performs well on external datasets (0.872 and 0.810 accuracy).

Conclusion: The DenseNet-121 model is highly effective for classifying mpMRI series, improving radiologists' workflow efficiency and generalizing well to external data.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

*Jonghun Kim,Gyeongdeok Jo,Shinyoung Ra,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes an HE-based framework for medical image inference using VQGAN compression and polynomial approximations to balance privacy, efficiency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging requires privacy protection; HE enables secure computation but is computationally expensive for large images.

Method: Uses VQGAN to compress images, approximates activation functions with low-degree polynomials, and adapts squeeze and excitation modules.

Result: Achieves optimal balance with 8x downsampling, showing practical potential despite minor performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a viable solution for secure, efficient HE inference in medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

*Haolong Jin,Shenglin Liu,Cong Cong,Qingmin Feng,Yongzhi Liu,Lina Huang,Yingzi Hu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FedWSIDD is a federated learning approach for medical image analysis, using dataset distillation to transmit synthetic slides instead of model parameters, addressing privacy and resource heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative WSI classification across institutions while preserving patient privacy and handling computational resource disparities.

Method: Proposes FedWSIDD, which uses dataset distillation with stain normalization to create synthetic slides, transmitted and aggregated by a server.

Result: Improves local WSI classification performance, supports heterogeneous models, and ensures privacy, validated on CAMELYON datasets.

Conclusion: FedWSIDD is an effective, privacy-preserving solution for federated WSI classification tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is
available at FedWSIDD.

*Yu Xing,Shishi Huang,Meng Lv,Guo Chen,Huailiang Wang,Lingzhi Sui*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses noise issues in ultra-compact analog image sensors for single-use endoscopes, proposing a hybrid denoising system combining traditional and learning-based techniques, achieving significant PSNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturized endoscopes with ultra-compact sensors improve flexibility and reduce invasiveness but suffer from noise due to limited photosensitive area and analog signal transmission.

Method: Developed a noise model for analog sensors and proposed a hybrid denoising system integrating traditional and learning-based techniques.

Result: The system reduces noise without detail loss, achieves real-time performance, and improves PSNR from 21.16 to 33.05.

Conclusion: The hybrid denoising system effectively addresses noise in ultra-compact endoscope sensors, enhancing image quality for medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

TL;DR: The study explores how image preprocessing techniques (PMD filter, CLAHE, and a hybrid approach) improve CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset, showing significant metric improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer is a major health issue, especially in developing countries, and early detection via automated screening (using CNNs) is hindered by image quality.

Method: Evaluated three preprocessing techniques (PMD, CLAHE, hybrid PMD-CLAHE) on pretrained CNN models (ResNet, SqueezeNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet) using the SIPaKMeD dataset.

Result: Hybrid PMD-CLAHE preprocessing improved CNN performance, with maximum gains of 13.62% accuracy, 10.04% precision, 13.08% recall, and 14.34% F1-score.

Conclusion: The hybrid PMD-CLAHE technique enhances Pap smear image quality and CNN classification performance, offering a promising approach for cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid UNet-Transformer model for tumor segmentation in MRI datasets from a local hospital, achieving competitive results (Dice: 0.764, IoU: 0.736) and emphasizing the need for site-specific AI models in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-based segmentation models rely on large public datasets, which lack local patient heterogeneity. This study aims to develop and integrate accurate, efficient AI models for tumor segmentation using local hospital data under privacy protection.

Method: A hybrid UNet-Transformer architecture with attention modules (efficient attention, SE blocks, CBAM, ResNeXt) was trained on 6080 locally acquired MRI images. Pretrained ImageNet weights and dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs were used for efficient training.

Result: The model achieved a Dice score of 0.764 and IoU of 0.736, showing competitive performance despite limited data.

Conclusion: Site-specific AI model development is crucial for clinical deployment, as demonstrated by the success of the hybrid UNet-Transformer approach on local MRI data.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

*Arbind Agrahari Baniya,Tsz-Kwan Lee,Peter W. Eklund,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) and a deep learning model (S3PO) for super-resolution, addressing distortion in 360° videos and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited spatial resolution and distortion in 360° videos degrade visual quality, and existing VSR techniques don't handle these issues well. Lack of datasets also hinders research.

Method: Proposes S3PO, a deep learning model with recurrent modeling and attention, featuring a custom loss function and extractor for spherical distortion.

Result: S3PO outperforms state-of-the-art VSR and 360°-specific models on 360VDS, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: S3PO effectively addresses 360° video super-resolution challenges, offering improved performance and insights via architectural and training optimizations.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

### [135] [Cost-Efficient Serving of LLM Agents via Test-Time Plan Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14852)
*Qizheng Zhang,Michael Wornow,Kunle Olukotun*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Proposes agentic plan caching to reduce costs in LLM-based agentic applications by reusing structured plan templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM caching techniques are inadequate for agentic applications due to dependency on external data or contexts.

Method: Extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses plan templates from completed executions, using keyword matching and lightweight models for adaptation.

Result: Reduces costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Agentic plan caching offers an efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents, complementing existing infrastructures.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

### [136] [Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836)
*Mark M. Bailey,Mark I. Heiligman*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topological framework using persistent homology to detect structural changes in media narratives during major global events, revealing patterns of semantic disruption and narrative volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and analyze how global events reshape public discourse by examining structural changes in media narratives.

Method: Constructs daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases from news articles, embeds them, and transforms into persistence diagrams using Vietoris-Rips filtration. Computes Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies to measure semantic disruption.

Result: Major events correlate with spikes in H0 and H1 dimensions, indicating narrative reorganization. Cross-correlation shows H0 changes precede H1 shifts, except for the Russian invasion of Ukraine where H1 leads.

Conclusion: Persistent homology provides an unsupervised, mathematically principled method to detect real-time narrative shifts during crises, advancing computational social science.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Embodied Web Agents, a new AI paradigm integrating physical embodiment and web-scale reasoning, with a benchmark for tasks requiring cross-domain intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are siloed, limiting their ability to solve tasks requiring both physical and digital intelligence.

Method: Developed a unified simulation platform (Embodied Web Agents task environments) and benchmark for diverse tasks like cooking and navigation.

Result: Revealed performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI and humans, highlighting challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for AI agents that bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning, with open datasets and tools.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-4o for extracting economic narratives from news articles, finding it effective but not expert-level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional NLP pipelines in extracting deeper semantic economic narratives.

Method: Analyzed GPT-4o's performance on extracting narratives from Wall Street Journal and New York Times articles, comparing it to expert annotations.

Result: GPT-4o extracts valid economic narratives but struggles with complex documents and narratives compared to experts.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o show promise for economic narrative extraction but require further refinement for expert-level tasks.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Motivation: To enhance VIPs' outdoor navigation in urban environments by leveraging drones and AI.

Method: A geometric formulation with multi-DNN framework for obstacle avoidance, combining local perception-based planning and global GPS/map-based planning.

Result: Feasibility verified in three scenarios: footpath walking, near parked vehicles, and crowded streets.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively aids VIPs in urban navigation, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors combined with machine
learning and computer vision algorithms is impacting a number of domains,
including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we
examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in
navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a
perception-based path planning system for local planning around the
neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps
for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and
propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well
as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university
campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three
scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a
crowded street.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robust Instant Policy (RIP), a method to improve reliability in In-Context Imitation Learning by mitigating LLM hallucination issues through robust trajectory aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unreliability of LLM-based instant policies in robotics due to hallucination issues, which generate poor trajectories deviating from demonstrations.

Method: Proposes RIP, which uses Student's t-regression to aggregate multiple candidate trajectories from an LLM, ignoring outliers (hallucinations) for robust trajectory generation.

Result: RIP outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, achieving at least 26% higher task success rates, especially in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: RIP effectively mitigates hallucination issues in LLM-based policies, enhancing reliability and performance in robotics tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM is a Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that improves object-level mapping in complex outdoor scenarios using surround-view cameras, semantic-geometric-temporal fusion, and omnidirectional loop closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLAM approaches rely on RGB-D or monocular views, which have limitations like narrow fields of view and occlusion sensitivity, leading to inaccurate object modeling.

Method: The system integrates point features and object-level landmarks with open-vocabulary semantics, uses semantic-geometric-temporal fusion for robust object association, and includes an omnidirectional loop closure module for viewpoint-invariant place recognition.

Result: MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping, with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides a robust and semantically enriched mapping solution for complex outdoor environments, supporting downstream reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in modeling deformable objects due to diverse properties and limited visual data.

Method: Hybrid particle-grid representation with Gaussian Splattings for rendering, trained on sparse-view RGB-D recordings.

Result: Learns dynamics of diverse objects, generalizes to unseen instances, and outperforms state-of-the-art simulators.

Conclusion: Effective for modeling deformable objects and useful in model-based planning for manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of decoding natural language from EEG in open-vocabulary scenarios, where traditional methods fail due to noise and variability.

Method: ETS integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data for text generation and sentiment classification.

Result: Superior performance in BLEU/Rouge scores for EEG-to-text and 10% F1 improvement in sentiment classification, with cross-subject robustness.

Conclusion: ETS shows promise for high-performance open-vocabulary EEG-to-text systems.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Assembly-of-Experts' (AoE), a method to efficiently create child models from Mixture-of-Experts parents by interpolating weights, reducing computational costs while maintaining functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost (10^13-10^15 FLOPs) of pretraining LLMs motivates the need for efficient methods to leverage existing models.

Method: AoE interpolates individual weight tensors from parent models, enabling gradual or sharp trait changes in child models.

Result: The method produces functional child models, like the DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera', which achieves parent-level intelligence with fewer tokens and no fine-tuning.

Conclusion: AoE offers a scalable, efficient way to create capable child models from existing experts, reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: To address the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals for general reasoning beyond math and code, and to explore RL's broader applicability.

Method: Developed Guru, a corpus of 92K verifiable examples across six reasoning domains, with domain-specific reward design and filtering. Evaluated RL training effects across domains and introduced Guru-7B and Guru-32B models.

Result: Guru models achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines by 7.9% and 6.7%, and showed RL's nuanced impact on skill acquisition across domains.

Conclusion: RL can facilitate genuine skill acquisition in domains with limited pretraining exposure, and Guru provides a scalable, effective framework for general-purpose reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

TL;DR: The paper explores how in-context learning (ICL) works with missing or incorrect labels, showing that multilayer transformers outperform single-layer models by leveraging unlabeled data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why ICL remains effective despite noisy or incomplete labels, and to theoretically analyze the role of model architecture in exploiting unlabeled data.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with missing labels, comparing single-layer and multilayer transformers.

Result: Multilayer transformers implicitly construct estimators that leverage unlabeled data, with performance improving exponentially with depth.

Conclusion: Looping or deepening off-the-shelf tabular models enhances semi-supervised learning, validated by real-world dataset evaluations.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

### [148] [Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15538)
*Laura Kopf,Nils Feldhus,Kirill Bykov,Philine Lou Bommer,Anna Hedström,Marina M. -C. Höhne,Oliver Eberle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a new framework for identifying and scoring polysemantic features in neural networks, improving interpretability by capturing multiple concepts per feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume neurons are monosemantic, limiting their ability to describe complex neural network behaviors. PRISM addresses this by handling polysemanticity.

Method: PRISM provides nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features, unlike prior single-description approaches.

Result: PRISM outperforms existing methods in description quality and polysemanticity capture, validated through benchmarking on language models.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances interpretability by better reflecting the complexity of neural network features, especially in polysemantic cases.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

*Gabrel J. Perin,Runjin Chen,Xuxi Chen,Nina S. T. Hirata,Zhangyang Wang,Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoX, a training-free method to enhance LLM safety by extrapolating low-rank subspaces, reducing attack success rates by 11-54%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of aligned LLMs to safety breaches during fine-tuning, even with benign data.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX) to robustify safety-critical subspaces in LLM parameters without additional training.

Result: LoX reduces attack success rates by 11-54% and moves parameters to a flatter, less sensitive zone.

Conclusion: LoX effectively enhances LLM safety robustness against fine-tuning attacks while maintaining task adaptability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

### [150] [AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651)
*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule automates rule extraction from human feedback for RLHF, improving model performance and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF methods rely on manual rule engineering, which is inefficient. AutoRule aims to automate this process.

Method: AutoRule extracts rules in three stages: interpreting preferences, identifying candidate rules, and synthesizing them. It uses rule-based rewards alongside learned rewards for policy optimization.

Result: AutoRule improves win rate by 28.6% on AlpacaEval2.0 and gains 6.1% on MT-Bench compared to GRPO. It reduces reward hacking and aligns well with dataset preferences.

Conclusion: AutoRule effectively automates rule extraction, enhancing RLHF performance and capturing unique dataset qualities.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

### [151] [PIPE: Physics-Informed Position Encoding for Alignment of Satellite Images and Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14786)
*Haobo Li,Eunseo Jung,Zixin Chen,Zhaowei Wang,Yueya Wang,Huamin Qu,Alexis Kai Hon Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIPE, a physics-informed positional encoding method, enhances multimodal time series forecasting by embedding physical information into vision language models, improving alignment and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches neglect visual data in time series, missing critical physical information like geospatial context in satellite imagery.

Method: PIPE introduces physics-informed positional indexing and variant-frequency positional encoding to embed physical and sequential order information.

Result: PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting.

Conclusion: PIPE effectively bridges the gap in utilizing visual data for multimodal forecasting, demonstrating significant accuracy gains.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

### [152] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates dense latents in sparse autoencoders (SAEs), showing they are meaningful and persistent, not just training artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role and origin of dense latents in SAEs, which are often dismissed as noise.

Method: Systematic study of dense latents' geometry, function, and origin, including ablation experiments and taxonomy development.

Result: Dense latents serve functional roles (e.g., position tracking, semantic features) and evolve across model layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents are intrinsic to language models and play meaningful computational roles.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

*Sunil Kumar,Bowen Zhao,Leo Dirac,Paulina Varshavskaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smaller-scale VLMs trained with GRPO and external tools like zoom outperform baselines in VQA tasks by leveraging detailed visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the struggle of VLMs with detailed visual reasoning under limited compute resources.

Method: Training smaller models using GRPO, a simple reward structure, simplified tool-calling, extra tokens for tool results, and a data mix favoring visually difficult examples.

Result: Improved performance on VQA tasks compared to similarly-sized baseline models.

Conclusion: Combining GRPO with external tools enhances VLM performance in detailed visual reasoning.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

TL;DR: CACTUS improves AMD stage classification by addressing data limitations and model transparency in healthcare ML, outperforming standard models with explainability and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data is often incomplete or limited, hindering ML model performance. AMD diagnosis requires early and accurate classification, but existing models lack transparency and trustworthiness.

Method: Introduced CACTUS, a tool for AMD stage classification, which incorporates genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. It provides explainability and identifies key features for decision-making.

Result: CACTUS outperforms standard ML models, enhances confidence in results, and aligns with medical knowledge by eliminating biased data.

Conclusion: CACTUS offers a reliable, transparent, and flexible solution for AMD classification, improving clinical decision-making and addressing data biases.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

*Alaa Anani,Tobias Lorenz,Mario Fritz,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a certification framework to ensure pixel-level robustness in post-hoc attribution methods for deep learning, addressing their vulnerability to input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc attribution methods are non-robust to small input perturbations, undermining their trustworthiness. The goal is to provide rigorous robustness guarantees for these methods.

Method: The proposed framework uses randomized smoothing to sparsify and smooth attribution maps, reformulating the task as a segmentation problem to certify pixel importance against perturbations.

Result: The framework is evaluated on 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models, demonstrating robust, interpretable, and faithful certified attributions.

Conclusion: The certification framework enables reliable use of attribution methods in downstream tasks by ensuring robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes bugs in DataViz libraries, identifying symptoms, root causes, and a taxonomy. It highlights incorrect plots as a major issue, explores automated testing methods, and evaluates VLMs for bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding bugs in DataViz libraries is critical due to their potential to mislead users and impact decision-making.

Method: Analyzed 564 bugs from five DataViz libraries, categorized symptoms and root causes, and explored VLMs for bug detection.

Result: Found pervasive incorrect plots, identified root causes, and tested VLMs with varying effectiveness (29%-57%).

Conclusion: The study provides insights for improving DataViz library testing and suggests further research on automated techniques and VLMs.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for full-body human pose estimation using loosely attached IMU sensors, leveraging transformer-based diffusion models and garment-aware training to outperform existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU-based motion capture assumes tight sensor attachment, which is unrealistic. The paper addresses the challenge of pose estimation with loosely attached sensors.

Method: Simulates IMU data from a garment-aware dataset, uses transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data, and incorporates garment parameters during training.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The work opens a promising direction for research in motion capture with loosely attached IMUs, enhanced by garment-aware modeling.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: A one-shot face sketch synthesis method using diffusion models is proposed, addressing data scarcity and labor costs in traditional methods. A new benchmark, OS-Sketch, is introduced for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on large datasets, facing issues like data scarcity and high costs. The goal is to enable effective synthesis with minimal training data.

Method: Optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using photo-sketch pairs, then use these instructions for inference. Introduces the OS-Sketch benchmark for evaluation.

Result: The method successfully converts photos into realistic sketches with minimal training data, outperforming other methods in convenience and applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed one-shot method is effective and practical, with potential for broader use. The OS-Sketch dataset supports further research.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

TL;DR: Nabla-R2D3 is a reinforcement learning framework for aligning 3D diffusion models with 2D rewards, outperforming baselines in reward achievement and reducing prior forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generative models lack alignment with human preferences and realistic attributes, prompting the need for improved methods.

Method: Uses Nabla-GFlowNet to align 3D diffusion models with 2D rewards via reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting compared to vanilla finetuning baselines.

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3 effectively adapts 3D diffusion models using 2D rewards, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.
