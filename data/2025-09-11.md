TL;DR: BERT-LSTM hybrid model achieves 0.72 F1 score for bilingual language identification between Wolaita and Gofa languages in Ethiopia


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address language identification challenges in multilingual communities where text contains multiple languages, particularly for similar languages like Wolaita and Gofa in southern Ethiopia

Method: Employed various experimental approaches, with best results from combining BERT-based pretrained language model with LSTM architecture

Result: The BERT-LSTM combination achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test set

Conclusion: This work provides an effective solution for addressing social media issues in multilingual contexts and establishes a foundation for future research in bilingual language identification

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

### [2] [AntiDote: Bi-level Adversarial Training for Tamper-Resistant LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08000)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AntiDote is a bi-level optimization method that trains LLMs to resist malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving utility, achieving 27.4% better robustness with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-weight LLMs face tension between research accessibility and misuse prevention, as current safety measures fail against adversaries with full model access who can erase safeguards through fine-tuning.

Method: Uses bi-level optimization with an auxiliary adversary hypernetwork that generates malicious LoRA weights conditioned on the defender model's activations. The defender LLM is trained to nullify these adversarial weight additions.

Result: 27.4% more robust against 52 diverse red-teaming attacks (jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, weight-space attacks) with less than 0.5% performance degradation on MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and compute-efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is more integral and resilient, addressing the fundamental tension between accessibility and misuse prevention.

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

*Yao Liang,Dongcheng Zhao,Feifei Zhao,Guobin Shen,Yuwei Wang,Dongqi Liang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MVPBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM value alignment across 75 countries with 24,020 annotated instances, revealing geographic and demographic disparities and showing that lightweight fine-tuning methods can significantly improve alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks neglect cultural and demographic diversity, limiting understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally across diverse user populations.

Method: Introduces MVPBench with 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and demographic metadata. Evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs and tests lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA and DPO.

Result: Reveals substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic and demographic lines. Shows that lightweight fine-tuning methods significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: Underscores the necessity for population-aware alignment evaluation and provides actionable insights for building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a foundation for future research on global alignment and equitable AI development.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized
value modeling, and equitable AI development.

Abstract: This paper presents the methodologies and results of the NOWJ team's
participation across all five tasks at the COLIEE 2025 competition, emphasizing
advancements in the Legal Case Entailment task (Task 2). Our comprehensive
approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5),
embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large
Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance
scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage
retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM
analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in

integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models,
providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information
processing.

### [5] [SciGPT: A Large Language Model for Scientific Literature Understanding and Knowledge Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08032)
*Fengyu She,Nan Wang,Hongfei Wu,Ziyi Wan,Jingmian Wang,Chang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciGPT is a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific literature that outperforms GPT-4o on scientific tasks through innovative domain distillation, SMoE attention, and knowledge-aware adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating bottlenecks for researchers. General-purpose LLMs fail to capture scientific nuances and struggle with complex scientific tasks, limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research.

Method: Built on Qwen3 architecture with three innovations: (1) low-cost domain distillation via two-stage pipeline, (2) Sparse Mixture-of-Experts attention mechanism reducing memory by 55% for long documents, (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o on ScienceBench in core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference. Shows strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks.

Conclusion: SciGPT demonstrates potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery by effectively addressing domain-specific challenges in scientific literature processing.

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

### [6] [No for Some, Yes for Others: Persona Prompts and Other Sources of False Refusal in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08075)
*Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Paul Röttger,Nino Scherrer,Emanuele Borgonovo,Elmar Plischke,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona prompting in LLMs can cause false refusals, but the effect is smaller in more capable models and influenced by model choice and task type rather than just sociodemographic personas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of sociodemographic personas on false refusal rates in LLMs, as previous work suggested persona prompting leads to false request refusals but lacked comprehensive measurement.

Method: Used Monte Carlo-based method to test 15 sociodemographic personas across 16 models, 3 tasks (NLI, politeness, offensiveness classification), and 9 prompt paraphrases in a sample-efficient manner.

Result: More capable models show less persona impact on refusal rates. Model choice and task significantly influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Some sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in certain models.

Conclusion: Persona effects on false refusals have been overestimated and are more influenced by model capabilities and task characteristics than sociodemographic factors alone.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

### [7] [Culturally transmitted color categories in LLMs reflect a learning bias toward efficient compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08093)
*Nathaniel Imel,Noga Zaslavsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can develop human-like efficient semantic categorization systems through Information Bottleneck principles, similar to how human languages evolve for optimal compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can evolve human-like semantic categorization systems that achieve near-optimal compression via Information Bottleneck principles, rather than just mimicking training data patterns.

Method: Replicated two human behavioral studies using Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct: 1) English color-naming study comparing to native speakers, 2) Simulated cultural evolution via iterated in-context learning to test if LLMs restructure systems toward IB-efficiency.

Result: Gemini aligned well with English speakers' naming patterns and achieved high IB-efficiency, while Llama showed efficient but lower complexity. Both LLMs iteratively restructured random systems toward greater IB-efficiency and cross-linguistic alignment, similar to humans.

Conclusion: LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded, human-like semantic systems driven by the same Information Bottleneck efficiency principle that governs semantic organization across human languages.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

### [8] [MERLIN: Multi-Stage Curriculum Alignment for Multilingual Encoder and LLM Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08105)
*Kosei Uemura,David Guzmán,Quang Phuoc Nguyen,Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi,En-shiun Annie Lee,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN is a two-stage model-stacking framework that uses curriculum learning and DoRA weights to significantly improve reasoning accuracy in low-resource languages, outperforming existing methods and GPT-4o-mini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with complex reasoning in low-resource languages (LRLs), and existing encoder-plus-decoder methods leave a large performance gap on LRLs despite working well on mid/high-resource languages.

Method: Two-stage model-stacking framework that applies curriculum learning from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data, adapting only a small set of DoRA weights for efficient parameter optimization.

Result: On AfriMGSM benchmark: +12.9 pp improvement over MindMerger, outperforms GPT-4o-mini. Consistent gains on MGSM (+0.9 pp) and MSVAMP (+2.8 pp) across both low and high-resource settings.

Conclusion: MERLIN effectively addresses the reasoning gap in low-resource languages through curriculum learning and efficient parameter adaptation, demonstrating strong performance across diverse language resource settings.

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

### [9] [Bias after Prompting: Persistent Discrimination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08146)
*Nivedha Sivakumar,Natalie Mackraz,Samira Khorshidi,Krishna Patel,Barry-John Theobald,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Biases can transfer from pre-trained LLMs to adapted models through prompting, and existing prompt-based mitigation methods fail to consistently prevent this bias transfer across various demographics and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language models to adapted models, particularly focusing on prompt adaptations which are widely used in real-world applications.

Method: Studied bias transfer hypothesis in causal models under prompt adaptations, examining correlations between intrinsic biases and those after prompt adaptation across different demographics (gender, age, religion) and tasks (co-reference resolution, question answering). Also evaluated various few-shot composition parameters and prompt-based debiasing strategies.

Result: Found strong to moderate correlations between intrinsic biases and post-adaptation biases (rho >= 0.94 for gender, >= 0.98 for age, >= 0.69 for religion). Biases remained strongly correlated across different few-shot parameters (rho >= 0.90). Prompt-based debiasing strategies showed distinct strengths but none consistently reduced bias transfer.

Conclusion: Correcting bias in intrinsic models may be necessary to prevent propagation of biases to downstream tasks, as prompt adaptations alone cannot reliably mitigate bias transfer from pre-trained LLMs.

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

*Supriya Lall,Christian Farrell,Hari Pathanjaly,Marko Pavic,Sarvesh Chezhian,Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbalized Algorithms (VAs) use classical algorithms with LLMs as oracles for simple operations, improving reliability on reasoning tasks like sorting and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional one-shot LLM querying for reasoning tasks is unreliable. VAs leverage established classical algorithms to decompose complex tasks into simple, reliable LLM operations.

Method: Decompose tasks into elementary operations on natural language strings, using LLMs as binary comparison oracles within well-analyzed algorithms like bitonic sorting networks.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on sorting and clustering tasks, showing improved reliability over one-shot LLM approaches.

Conclusion: Verbalized Algorithms provide a more reliable paradigm for LLM-based reasoning by constraining LLMs to simple operations within proven algorithmic frameworks.

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

### [11] [Balancing Quality and Variation: Spam Filtering Distorts Data Label Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08217)
*Eve Fleisig,Matthias Orlikowski,Philipp Cimiano,Dan Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing annotator filtering methods designed for objective tasks often remove legitimate disagreement instead of spam, harming label diversity in subjective tasks. Conservative filtering (<5% removal) works best, as spammers tend to be less random than assumed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance annotator reliability and representation in subjective machine learning tasks, ensuring datasets preserve diverse opinions while filtering out actual spam.

Method: Empirical evaluation of various annotator filtering heuristics on subjective tasks, analyzing their impact on label variation preservation and accuracy. Synthetic spam analysis to understand spammer behavior patterns.

Result: Most filtering methods remove legitimate disagreeing annotators rather than spammers, increasing error from true average labels. Spammers are often distributionally indistinguishable from real annotators, with distinguishable spammers giving fixed rather than random answers.

Conclusion: Subjective tasks require spam removal methods that account for label diversity, as spammers tend to be less random than non-spammers, reversing the intuition of existing filtering approaches.

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

*Yehudit Aperstein,Alon Gottlib,Gal Benita,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for modeling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR) using QA to classify document pairs into equivalence, inclusion, or semantic overlap based on information alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how information is shared across documents regardless of format is critical for information retrieval, summarization, and content alignment tasks.

Method: QA-based approach using answerability of shared questions across documents as semantic coverage indicator. Synthetic dataset from SQuAD with paraphrased passages and controlled information omission. Benchmarking generative models and training transformer classifiers.

Result: Discriminative models outperform generative approaches. RoBERTa-base achieved 61.4% accuracy, Random Forest showed best balance with 52.9% macro-F1 score.

Conclusion: QA provides effective lens for assessing semantic relations across diverse texts, offering insights into models' capacity to reason about information beyond surface similarity.

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transparency of automated writing scores by providing detailed subtrait assessment that demystifies scores for educators and students.

Method: Prototyping explainability and subtrait scoring using generative language models to assess latent-trait components of writing.

Result: Modest correlation observed between human subtrait and trait scores, and between automated and human subtrait scores.

Conclusion: The approach provides detailed scoring explanations that can help educators and students better understand automated writing assessments.

Abstract: Subtrait (latent-trait components) assessment presents a promising path
toward enhancing transparency of automated writing scores. We prototype
explainability and subtrait scoring with generative language models and show
modest correlation between human subtrait and trait scores, and between
automated and human subtrait scores. Our approach provides details to demystify
scores for educators and students.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated detection of templated responses in English language assessments using machine learning to prevent test takers from gaming automated scoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-skill test takers use memorized templates to fool automated scoring systems in high-stakes English language assessments, compromising test integrity.

Method: Machine learning-based approach for automated detection of inauthentic, templated responses (AuDITR task).

Result: Development of a system to identify templated responses, with emphasis on the need for regular model updates in production environments.

Conclusion: Regular updates of detection models are crucial for maintaining the effectiveness of automated scoring systems against evolving template-based cheating strategies.

Abstract: In high-stakes English Language Assessments, low-skill test takers may employ
memorized materials called ``templates'' on essay questions to ``game'' or fool
the automated scoring system. In this study, we introduce the automated
detection of inauthentic, templated responses (AuDITR) task, describe a machine
learning-based approach to this task and illustrate the importance of regularly
updating these models in production.

### [15] [<think> So let's replace this phrase with insult... </think> Lessons learned from generation of toxic texts with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08358)
*Sergey Pletenev,Daniil Moskovskiy,Alexander Panchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated synthetic toxic data performs worse than human data for text detoxification training, with up to 30% performance drop due to limited lexical diversity in generated insults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLM-generated synthetic toxic data can effectively replace human-generated data for training detoxification models in sensitive domains.

Method: Used Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models to generate synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2 datasets, then compared fine-tuned models on synthetic vs human data.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data consistently underperformed those trained on human data, with up to 30% performance drop in joint metrics, due to LLMs generating toxic content with limited, repetitive vocabulary.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in generating diverse toxic content, highlighting the continued importance of human-annotated data for building robust detoxification systems.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETLCH is a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned for structured data extraction tasks using minimal data (few hundred to one thousand samples per task), outperforming larger models while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller teams struggle with high costs of large LLMs and dataset preparation for structured data extraction in domains like financial compliance, legal analytics, and multilingual knowledge bases. There's limited evidence on whether smaller models can perform reliably under low-resource, multi-task conditions.

Method: Developed ETLCH - a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on minimal data (few hundred to one thousand samples per task) for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition.

Result: ETLCH outperforms strong baselines across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains even at the lowest data scale, demonstrating stable and accurate structured outputs.

Conclusion: Well-tuned small models can deliver reliable structured data extraction at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling cost-effective information extraction pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

*Jinzhong Ning,Paerhati Tulajiang,Yingying Le,Yijia Zhang,Yuanyuan Sun,Hongfei Lin,Haifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: New large-scale real-human speech dataset (CommonVoice-SpeechRE) and novel framework (RPG-MoGe) for speech relation extraction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechRE datasets rely heavily on synthetic data, lack diversity, and models suffer from rigid generation templates and weak semantic alignment.

Method: Proposed RPG-MoGe framework with multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy and CNN-based latent relation prediction heads for explicit relation prompts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both benchmark dataset and effective solution for real-world SpeechRE.

Conclusion: The approach addresses key limitations in SpeechRE research with a large-scale real-human dataset and innovative framework that improves performance through multi-order generation and better cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

*Fanzhen Liu,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore,Surya Nepal,Cecile Paris,Jia Wu,Jian Yang,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper on adversarial attacks against automated fact-checking systems, examining attack methodologies, defenses, and research gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spreads freely and automated fact-checking systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate claims, evidence, or claim-evidence pairs, undermining their reliability.

Method: Comprehensive review and categorization of existing adversarial attack methodologies targeting fact-checking systems, evaluation of their impact, and examination of adversary-aware defenses.

Result: Identified key challenges in understanding attack strategies, assessing model resilience, and enhancing robustness. Found that current systems remain vulnerable to various adversarial manipulations.

Conclusion: Urgent need for resilient fact-checking frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial attacks while maintaining high verification accuracy, with several open research questions requiring further exploration.

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

### [19] [Acquiescence Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08480)
*Daniel Braun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs display a bias towards answering 'no' in surveys, contrary to human acquiescence bias where people tend to agree regardless of beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Since LLMs are trained on human data and are influenceable by input changes, researchers wanted to investigate if they exhibit the same acquiescence bias (tendency to agree) that humans show in surveys.

Method: Conducted a study across different LLM models, tasks, and languages (English, German, Polish) to test for acquiescence bias patterns.

Result: Contrary to human behavior, LLMs consistently displayed a bias towards answering 'no' regardless of whether it indicated agreement or disagreement with statements.

Conclusion: LLMs do not exhibit human-like acquiescence bias but instead show a systematic 'no' bias, suggesting fundamental differences in response patterns compared to human survey behavior.

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

### [20] [Simulating Identity, Propagating Bias: Abstraction and Stereotypes in LLM-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08484)
*Pia Sommerauer,Giulia Rambelli,Tommaso Caselli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona-prompting in LLMs doesn't effectively modulate linguistic abstraction levels and may propagate stereotypes even when simulating marginalized groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic abstraction (a marker of stereotyping) when LLMs generate texts about socio-demographic categories with stereotypical/non-stereotypical attributes.

Method: Analyzed outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to generic AI assistant outputs. Used Self-Stereo dataset of self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. Measured abstraction through concreteness, specificity, and negation metrics.

Result: Persona-prompting has limited effectiveness in modulating abstraction in language, confirming concerns about personas as representative of socio-demographic groups and showing risk of propagating stereotypes.

Conclusion: Persona-prompting fails to adequately address stereotyping issues in LLMs and may actually reinforce stereotypes, raising concerns about using this technique for representing marginalized groups.

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

*Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrinityX is a modular alignment framework using Mixture of Calibrated Experts to improve LLM alignment across Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty dimensions simultaneously, outperforming baselines with significant improvements in performance metrics while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with consistent alignment to HHH principles (Helpfulness, Harmlessness, Honesty), as existing methods optimize individual dimensions in isolation, causing trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. Current MoE architectures suffer from poor routing calibration.

Method: Proposes TrinityX framework with Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within Transformer architecture. Uses separately trained experts for each HHH dimension with calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism to combine expert outputs into unified alignment-aware representation.

Result: Outperforms baselines on Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty) benchmarks with 32.5% win rate improvement, 33.9% safety score improvement, and 28.4% truthfulness improvement. Reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE approaches.

Conclusion: TrinityX effectively addresses multi-dimensional alignment challenges through calibrated expert routing, demonstrating superior performance across all HHH dimensions while being computationally efficient and generalizable across different LLM backbones.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

*Xue Zhang,Yunlong Liang,Fandong Meng,Songming Zhang,Yufeng Chen,Jinan Xu,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CM-Align improves multilingual alignment by using consistency-based methods to select high-quality English references and construct better multilingual preference pairs for DPO training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods have performance gaps between English and other languages in LLMs, and existing approaches create noisy multilingual preference data due to low-quality English references and biased construction methods.

Method: Consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction to create high-quality preference pairs for DPO training.

Result: Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the method.

Conclusion: The approach shows that constructing high-quality preference data is necessary for improving multilingual alignment performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

*Dima Galat,Diego Molla-Aliod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ensemble of zero-shot LLMs achieves state-of-the-art performance on biomedical Yes/No QA tasks without fine-tuning, using effective RAG pipelines and showing context length impacts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical QA requires precise interpretation of specialized knowledge from complex, evolving data. Current approaches need costly fine-tuning and lack generalizability.

Method: Uses ensemble of multiple zero-shot LLMs (including Anthropic and Google models) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for information retrieval and answer synthesis.

Result: Ensembles outperform individual LLMs and rival/surpass domain-tuned systems on BioASQ challenges. Found relationship between context length and performance - expanded contexts risk information dilution.

Conclusion: Ensemble-based zero-shot approaches with effective RAG pipelines provide practical, scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical QA, preserving generalizability without costly fine-tuning.

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of LLM memorization in medicine, showing it's more prevalent than in general domain, with three types: beneficial, uninformative, and harmful memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the extent of LLM memorization of medical training data and understand its prevalence, characteristics, volume, and potential impacts on medical applications.

Method: Systematic analysis of three adaptation scenarios: continued pretraining on medical corpora, fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and fine-tuning on real-world clinical data including 13,000+ inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System.

Result: Memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in general domain. Three types identified: beneficial (accurate recall of guidelines/references), uninformative (repeated disclaimers/templates), and harmful (sensitive clinical content regeneration).

Conclusion: Practical recommendations provided to facilitate beneficial memorization for domain accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization for deeper learning, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent patient data leakage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTESGN model uses Optimal Transport and syntactic-semantic collaboration to improve aspect-based sentiment analysis by better capturing nonlinear relationships and filtering noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ABSA methods struggle with complex semantic relationships and noise from irrelevant words due to linear dot-product features that fail to capture nonlinear associations.

Method: Proposes Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph Network (OTESGN) with Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative Attention, including Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention and Semantic Optimal Transport Attention, plus Adaptive Attention Fusion and contrastive regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30% F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks compared to previous best models.

Conclusion: OTESGN effectively captures sentiment signals obscured by noise through optimal transport and syntactic-semantic collaboration, demonstrating superior performance in opinion word localization and noise resistance.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated framework that uses evolutionary methods to discover and optimize multi-turn-to-single-turn red-teaming templates, achieving 44.8% success rate on GPT-4.1 and demonstrating transferable structural improvements across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous M2S compression methods relied on limited manually written templates, creating a need for automated optimization of red-teaming templates to improve effectiveness and scalability.

Method: Evolutionary framework with language-model-guided evolution, smart sampling from 12 sources, LLM-as-judge evaluation inspired by StrongREJECT, and success threshold of θ=0.70 across 5 generations.

Result: 44.8% overall success rate (103/230) on GPT-4.1, discovery of 2 new template families, structural gains that transfer across models (though performance varies by target), and positive correlation between prompt length and success score.

Conclusion: Structure-level search provides reproducible improvement for single-turn probes, highlighting the importance of threshold calibration and cross-model evaluation in red-teaming template optimization.

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

TL;DR: DSM is a streaming sequence-to-sequence model that uses delayed alignment between multimodal streams, achieving state-of-the-art performance for ASR and TTS tasks with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sequence-to-sequence models operate offline, consuming complete inputs before generating outputs. Streaming approaches require complex policies for input/output timing. DSM aims to provide a simpler, more flexible streaming solution for multimodal tasks.

Method: Uses decoder-only language model with pre-processed time alignment between streams. Introduces appropriate delays between input and output streams to enable streaming inference for arbitrary sequence lengths and multimodal combinations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and latency for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. Supports arbitrary long sequences and is competitive with offline baselines.

Conclusion: DSM provides an effective and flexible framework for streaming multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning, demonstrating strong performance across major tasks while maintaining low latency capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Qwen-based models show different factual recall patterns than GPT-style models, with attention modules in early layers contributing more than MLPs, indicating architectural variations lead to different recall mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how factual associations are stored and retrieved in Transformer models and determine if prior findings about GPT-style models generalize across different autoregressive architectures.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of factual recall across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek) analyzing where and how factual information is encoded and accessed.

Result: Qwen-based models behave differently - attention modules in earliest layers contribute more to factual recall than MLP modules, unlike GPT-style models where MLPs dominate early layers.

Conclusion: Architectural variations within autoregressive Transformer family can lead to fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall, challenging the generalization of prior findings.

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

*Cheng Chen,Haiyan Yin,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes CAI Ratio metric for unsupervised evaluation of LLM annotation quality using student-teacher collaboration and majority voting without oracle feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLM annotation quality is challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where conventional methods fail and oracle feedback is scarce.

Method: Agentic annotation paradigm where student model collaborates with LLM teacher using user preference-based majority voting to assess annotation consistency. Introduces CAI Ratio metric to quantify reliability.

Result: CAI Ratio shows strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy across 10 NLP datasets and 4 LLMs, enabling robust model selection in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: CAI Ratio is an essential tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection, providing reliable assessment of LLM annotation quality without oracle feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

### [30] [MoVoC: Morphology-Aware Subword Construction for Geez Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08812)
*Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot,Dren Fazlija,Wolfgang Nejdl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoVoC is a morpheme-aware subword tokenization method that integrates supervised morphological analysis with BPE to preserve morphological boundaries in low-resource Geez script languages, showing improved linguistic fidelity despite no significant translation quality gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subword tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological boundaries, which is particularly problematic for low-resource, morphologically complex languages like those using the Geez script.

Method: Developed MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and trained MoVoC-Tok tokenizer that combines morpheme-based segmentation with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to maintain morphological integrity while preserving lexical meaning.

Result: The method did not achieve significant improvements in automatic translation quality but showed consistent gains in intrinsic metrics (MorphoScore and Boundary Precision), demonstrating enhanced linguistic fidelity and token efficiency.

Conclusion: Morphology-aware segmentation provides value for linguistic fidelity in low-resource languages. The authors release annotated morpheme data for four Geez script languages and vocabulary for two languages to support further research.

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are
available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC

*Thales Sales Almeida,Rodrigo Nogueira,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scalable methods for building web-based multilingual corpora, with Portuguese case study showing 120B token corpus achieves competitive results through language-specific filtering and continual pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how to construct effective training corpora for non-English languages in LLM development, as most existing work focuses on English.

Method: Develop scalable web-based corpus building methods, apply language-specific filtering pipelines (including STEM and toxic content classifiers), use continual pretraining setup to transition English-trained models to Portuguese.

Result: Built 120B token Portuguese corpus that achieves competitive results to industrial-grade corpus. Language-specific filtering and adaptation leads to performance improvements.

Conclusion: High-quality, language-specific data is crucial for multilingual LLM performance. The methods are applicable to other languages, providing valuable insights for multilingual development.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

*Joachim Baumann,Paul Röttger,Aleksandra Urman,Albert Wendsjö,Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Johannes B. Gruber,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM hacking refers to systematic biases and errors introduced by researcher implementation choices in LLM-based data annotation, leading to incorrect statistical conclusions in approximately one-third to half of hypotheses tested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the risk of systematic biases and errors in social science research caused by varying LLM implementation choices (model selection, prompting, temperature settings) that can lead to Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors.

Method: Replicated 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science studies using 18 different LLM models, analyzing 13 million LLM labels and testing 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how researcher choices affect statistical conclusions.

Result: Found incorrect conclusions in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models and half for small language models. Higher task performance and better model capabilities reduce but don't eliminate hacking risk. Common mitigation techniques were largely ineffective, and intentional hacking was found to be unacceptably simple.

Conclusion: LLM hacking poses significant risks to research validity, requiring more rigorous verification especially near significance thresholds. Human annotations remain crucial for reducing false positives, and current correction techniques are inadequate for addressing the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

TL;DR: Survey of RL advancements for reasoning with LLMs, focusing on challenges and future directions for scaling towards ASI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has significantly enhanced LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but faces foundational challenges in scaling for LRMs that need to be addressed.

Method: Comprehensive review and analysis of research applying RL to LLMs/LRMs for reasoning, examining foundational components, core problems, training resources, and applications.

Result: Identifies current state of RL for reasoning models and outlines key challenges in computational resources, algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure.

Conclusion: Timely review provides roadmap for enhancing RL scalability toward ASI and promotes future research on RL for broader reasoning models.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of 3D and 4D world modeling, establishing definitions, taxonomy, and evaluation metrics for video-based, occupancy-based, and LiDAR-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has focused on 2D image/video generation while overlooking native 3D/4D representations, and the field lacks standardized definitions and taxonomy, leading to fragmented research.

Method: The authors establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy (VideoGen, OccGen, LiDARGen), systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics, and provide a comprehensive literature review.

Result: The survey creates a coherent foundational reference for 3D/4D world modeling, addressing the gaps in standardized definitions and fragmented research approaches.

Conclusion: This work provides a structured framework for advancing 3D/4D world modeling research, identifies open challenges, and highlights promising future directions in the field.

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet is a novel deep learning framework for urban flood classification that integrates hierarchical cross-modal attention, heterogeneous convolutional multi-scale attention, and cascading transformer feature refinement to achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flood detection methods rely on unimodal data and static rule-based systems that fail to capture dynamic, non-linear flood relationships. Existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches have limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal integration, and adaptability to noisy environments.

Method: XFloodNet integrates three novel components: 1) Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention for dynamic visual-textual feature alignment, 2) Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention with frequency-enhanced channel and spatial attention, and 3) Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement for hierarchical feature harmonization.

Result: XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33% on Chennai Floods, 82.24% on Rhine18 Floods, and 88.60% on Harz17 Floods datasets, significantly surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: XFloodNet redefines urban flood classification through advanced deep learning techniques that effectively address the limitations of traditional methods, providing robust and noise-resistant flood detection with superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) is an inference-time method that processes video frames through multiple parallel streams to enhance temporal reasoning without increasing context window size or computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs face computational bottlenecks when increasing input frames for temporal detail, leading to prohibitive costs and performance degradation from long context lengths.

Method: VPS runs multiple parallel inference streams, each processing disjoint subsets of video frames, then aggregates output probabilities to integrate richer visual information than single-pass approaches.

Result: Extensive experiments across 2B-32B models on benchmarks like Video-MME and EventHallusion show VPS consistently and significantly improves performance, scaling better than alternatives like Self-consistency.

Conclusion: VPS provides a memory-efficient and robust framework that effectively contracts the Chinchilla scaling law, enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities of VideoLLMs without additional training.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: Multimodal stance detection framework combining text and visual information through hierarchical fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on climate change stance detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stance detection approaches focus only on text, but real-world social media content increasingly combines text with visual elements, creating a need for advanced multimodal methods.

Method: Uses Large Language Model for stance-relevant text summaries and domain-aware image caption generator for visual interpretation. Jointly models modalities through specialized transformer module that captures text-image interactions.

Result: Achieved 76.2% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on MultiClimate dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework effectively integrates textual and visual information for robust stance classification, demonstrating superior performance compared to text-only methods.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive machine learning-ready dataset for Martian digital elevation model prediction, addressing issues of artefacts and missing data in existing large-scale DEM processing pipelines.

Method: Developed processing pipeline for Mars orthoimage-DEM pairs from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CTX data, created 80,898 samples with optical images, DEM patches, and masks for missing/altered data. Trained small U-Net architecture on the dataset.

Result: Generated MCTED dataset with statistical insights including spatial distribution, elevation values, and slopes. The small U-Net trained on MCTED outperformed DepthAnythingV2's zero-shot performance on elevation prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Specialized training on domain-specific datasets (MCTED) yields better performance than general foundation models for Martian DEM prediction, demonstrating the value of curated planetary science datasets for machine learning applications.

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APML is a differentiable approximation of Earth Mover Distance that uses Sinkhorn iterations for one-to-one point matching, offering near-quadratic runtime and improved point cloud prediction without manual hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud loss functions like Chamfer Distance suffer from many-to-one correspondences causing point congestion and poor coverage, while EMD has prohibitive cubic complexity.

Method: Uses Sinkhorn iterations on temperature-scaled similarity matrix from pairwise distances, with analytically computed temperature to guarantee minimum assignment probability.

Result: Achieves faster convergence, superior spatial distribution in low-density regions, and improved quantitative performance on ShapeNet benchmarks and WiFi-based human point cloud generation.

Conclusion: APML provides an efficient, differentiable alternative to EMD with near-quadratic complexity, eliminating manual tuning while improving point cloud prediction quality.

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-RPCANet is a lightweight infrared small target detection framework that improves parameter efficiency and noise robustness through hierarchical bottleneck structures and channel attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding networks for infrared small target detection face challenges with parameter lightweightness and noise robustness, requiring a more efficient and robust solution.

Method: Proposes L-RPCANet based on robust principal component analysis, using hierarchical bottleneck structures for channel-wise feature refinement, noise reduction modules, and squeeze-and-excitation networks for channel attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on ISTD datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods including RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++.

Conclusion: The proposed L-RPCANet achieves excellent performance while maintaining both lightweight parameter design and robustness against complex noise in infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [42] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime for video compressive imaging that reduces power consumption by using only one sub-frame per spatial location, and introduces BSTFormer transformer architecture to recover high-speed frames from sparse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital cameras consume unsustainable power (~20W for 4K at 30fps), making gigapixel cameras at 100-1000fps impractical. Compressive measurement can reduce power by 10-100X but needs more efficient sampling strategies.

Method: Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) where only one sub-frame is set to 1 per spatial location (others 0). Built DMD encoding system and proposed BSTFormer transformer with local block attention, global sparse attention, and temporal attention to handle measurement mismatch.

Result: Significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art algorithms on both simulated and real-world data. USS provides higher dynamic range than random sampling and enables fixed exposure time suitable for on-chip implementation.

Conclusion: USS strategy with BSTFormer provides an effective solution for low-power, high-frame-rate video compressive imaging with practical advantages for hardware implementation and superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting fatal incidents in surveillance videos is difficult due to rarity and ethical data collection issues, requiring synthetic alternatives.

Method: Created GTA-Crime dataset using GTA5 with fatal situations from CCTV perspectives, plus snippet-level domain adaptation with Wasserstein adversarial training.

Result: Experimental results show GTA-Crime dataset and domain adaptation strategy consistently enhance real-world fatal violence detection accuracy.

Conclusion: GTA-Crime provides effective synthetic data solution for fatal incident detection, bridging synthetic-real domain gap with public dataset/framework.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepViT-CXR uses channel replication to adapt single-channel chest X-rays for Vision Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on TB and pneumonia detection across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers are pretrained on 3-channel natural images but chest X-rays are grayscale (single-channel), creating an incompatibility that limits ViT application in medical imaging.

Method: Proposed RepViT-CXR with channel replication strategy that converts single-channel CXR images into ViT-compatible format without information loss.

Result: Achieved 99.9% accuracy/AUC on TB-CXR, 99.0% accuracy on Pediatric Pneumonia, and 91.1% accuracy on Shenzhen TB dataset, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Simple channel replication enables ViTs to effectively process grayscale medical images, establishing new SOTA for TB/pneumonia detection with strong clinical deployment potential.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

*Zheng Yang,Yanteng Zhang,Xupeng Kou,Yang Liu,Chao Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel end-to-end network combining 3D CNN and Symmetry Interactive Transformer for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, focusing on brain asymmetry caused by atrophy and achieving 92.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often ignore the asymmetrical characteristics caused by brain disorders in Alzheimer's disease, and most rely on pretraining without addressing structural asymmetry.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end network with 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive Transformer (SIT). Uses inter-equal grid block fetch operation to align left and right hemisphere features, then feeds them into SIT to focus on asymmetry regions caused by structural changes.

Result: Achieved 92.5% diagnostic accuracy on ADNI dataset, outperforming several CNN methods and CNN-transformer combinations. Visualization shows the network focuses on brain atrophy regions and asymmetric pathological characteristics.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures asymmetric pathological features in Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating improved diagnostic performance and interpretability through its focus on structural asymmetry caused by brain atrophy.

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVDI++ is a self-supervised framework that uses event cameras to deblur videos and interpolate frames, achieving state-of-the-art performance through learnable double integration and adaptive fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-based cameras with long exposure times cause visual blurring and information loss between frames, degrading video quality. Event cameras' high temporal resolution can help mitigate these issues.

Method: Uses Learnable Double Integral (LDI) network to map reference frames to sharp images, learning-based division reconstruction module for varying exposure intervals, and adaptive parameter-free fusion strategy with confidence-based event integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for video deblurring and interpolation tasks, demonstrating generalizability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: EVDI++ provides an effective unified self-supervised framework that leverages event camera data to significantly improve video quality by reducing motion blur and enabling frame interpolation without requiring ground truth supervision.

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

TL;DR: HyMamba is a new hyperspectral object tracking network that uses state space modules to unify spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperspectral trackers fail to capture intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions, limiting their effectiveness in challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposes HyMamba network with Spectral State Integration (SSI) module and Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module that uses three directional scanning SSMs to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously, constructing joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs.

Result: Achieves 73.0% AUC score and 96.3% DP@20 score on HOTC2020 dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HyMamba effectively addresses limitations of existing hyperspectral trackers by unifying spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules, providing superior object tracking performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

*Saurav Sengupta,Nazanin Moradinasab,Jiebei Liu,Donald E. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs rely on training biases and fail on specific visual questions. A framework examines how input characteristics affect performance. Minor changes in images/prompts cause significant VLM behavior changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often disregard visual evidence and rely on inherent biases when answering specific questions about images, leading to inaccurate responses. This research aims to systematically understand which input characteristics cause these performance differences.

Method: Developed a multi-dimensional examination framework using open-source VLMs to analyze how attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (image size, number of objects, background color, prompt specificity).

Result: Even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt specificity can lead to large changes in how VLMs formulate answers and their overall performance.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into VLM behavior changes and explores methods for characterizing how input parameters affect model performance, highlighting the sensitivity of VLMs to subtle input variations.

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

*Hyeonseok Kim,Byeongkeun Kang,Yeejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E3DPC-GZSL is a novel method for generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that addresses biased predictions towards seen classes by integrating evidence-based uncertainty estimation and dynamic calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D point cloud segmentation models suffer from biased predictions favoring seen classes due to smaller training data scales compared to image-based tasks, leading to overconfidence in seen class predictions.

Method: Integrates evidence-based uncertainty estimator into classifier, uses dynamic calibrated stacking factor to adjust probabilities based on pointwise uncertainty, and employs novel training strategy that merges learnable parameters with text-derived features to refine semantic space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets including ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes without requiring separate classifiers, demonstrating superior performance in 3D point cloud zero-shot segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

### [50] [Dual-Thresholding Heatmaps to Cluster Proposals for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08289)
*Yuelin Guo,Haoyu He,Zhiyuan Chen,Zitong Huang,Renhao Lu,Lu Shi,Zejun Wang,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel weakly supervised object detection framework that addresses three key limitations in existing methods through heatmap-guided proposal selection, enhanced network architecture with background class representation, and negative certainty supervision for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSOD methods suffer from three main problems: 1) pseudo GT boxes either focus only on discriminative parts or fail to distinguish adjacent intra-class instances, 2) WSDDN lacks background class representation and has semantic gap between branches, 3) discarded ignored proposals lead to slow convergence.

Method: Proposes three key components: 1) Heatmap-Guided Proposal Selector (HGPS) with dual thresholds to pre-select proposals, 2) Weakly Supervised Basic Detection Network (WSBDN) with background class representation and heatmap pre-supervision, 3) Negative certainty supervision loss on ignored proposals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and 55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, outperforming existing WSOD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the three key limitations in WSOD, demonstrating superior performance through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets.

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCroP is a vision-language pre-training framework for chest CT scans that uses similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation by addressing spatial sparsity of lesions and complex relationships between reports and image sub-regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT scans have spatially sparse lesion distributions and complex implicit relationships between pathological descriptions in reports and their corresponding image sub-regions, making traditional vision-language pre-training challenging for medical imaging.

Method: Uses multi-modal masked modeling to optimize encoder for low-level semantics, similarity-driven alignment to select and align correct patches with report sentences, and cross-granularity fusion to integrate multimodal information across instance and word-patch levels.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art medical self-supervised learning and vision-language pre-training methods on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets.

Conclusion: SimCroP effectively captures key pathology structures in sparse radiographs and improves performance for multi-scale downstream tasks in medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and

TL;DR: BTS-EE is a sequential training method for early-exit CNNs that addresses covariance shift by aligning branch training with inference distributions, achieving 45% computation reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms requires balancing accuracy with latency/power budgets. Conventional early-exit training suffers from covariance shift where downstream branches are trained on full datasets but only process harder samples at inference.

Method: Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE) with sequential training where each branch is trained and calibrated before the next. Uses lightweight 1D convolution branch architecture and Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration for per-class threshold tuning.

Result: On CINIC-10 dataset with ResNet18 backbone, BTS-EE outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45% computation reduction with only 2% accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: BTS-EE expands design space for deploying CNNs in real-time systems, offering practical efficiency gains for industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring applications.

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNNs neglect clinical metadata and require extensive preprocessing, while general VLMs struggle with clinical specificity in melanoma diagnosis.

Method: Proposed a retrieval-augmented VLM framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the diagnostic prompt to enable informed predictions.

Result: Significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over conventional baselines in melanoma diagnosis.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support in melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Conclusion: InsFusion effectively mitigates error accumulation in 3D object detection pipelines and delivers superior performance while maintaining compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework that disentangles video into motion and content components using transformer architecture with vector quantization bottleneck and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a general framework for disentangling video data into dynamic motion and static content with fewer assumptions and inductive biases than previous works, enabling better video representation learning.

Method: Uses transformer-based architecture to generate implicit features for motion and content, incorporates low-bitrate vector quantization as information bottleneck, and employs denoising diffusion model with disentangled representations for self-supervised learning.

Result: Validated on real-world talking head videos for motion transfer and auto-regressive generation tasks, and shown to generalize to other video types like 2D cartoon character sprites.

Conclusion: Presents a new perspective on self-supervised learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to video analysis and generation with a flexible framework that requires fewer assumptions.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

*Dubing Chen,Huan Zheng,Yucheng Zhou,Xianfei Li,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel causal loss enables end-to-end supervision for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, making modular 2D-to-3D pipelines fully differentiable and learnable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use modular pipelines optimized independently, leading to cascading errors and suboptimal performance in 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Method: Proposes a causal loss based on 2D-to-3D semantic causality that regulates gradient flow, enabling end-to-end training. Includes three components: Channel-Grouped Lifting, Learnable Camera Offsets, and Normalized Convolution.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Occ3D benchmark with significant robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Conclusion: The causal loss framework successfully unifies modular pipelines into end-to-end trainable systems, overcoming limitations of independent module optimization.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

### [58] [VRAE: Vertical Residual Autoencoder for License Plate Denoising and Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08392)
*Cuong Nguyen,Dung T. Tran,Hong Nguyen,Xuan-Vu Phan,Nam-Phong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) for enhancing degraded vehicle images in traffic surveillance, achieving significant improvements over existing methods with minimal parameter increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle images in traffic surveillance often suffer from noise and blur due to adverse weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion, which reduces license plate recognition accuracy, especially when plates occupy small regions.

Method: VRAE architecture with an auxiliary block that injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide representation learning and preserve general information better than conventional autoencoders.

Result: Outperforms AE, GAN, and Flow-Based approaches - improves PSNR by ~20%, reduces NMSE by ~50%, enhances SSIM by 1%, with only ~1% parameter increase compared to AE at same depth.

Conclusion: The proposed VRAE method effectively enhances degraded vehicle images for license plate recognition in real-time traffic surveillance applications with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

### [59] [Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421)
*Keisuke Toida,Taigo Sakai,Naoki Kato,Kazutoyo Yokota,Takeshi Nakamura,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFusion is a new framework that improves multi-view multi-object tracking by addressing feature distortion and non-uniform density issues in Bird's-Eye-View projection through sparse transformation, density-aware weighting, and multi-view consistency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BEV projection methods for multi-view tracking suffer from feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by object scale variations with distance, which degrade detection and tracking accuracy.

Method: SCFusion combines three techniques: 1) sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation, 2) density-aware weighting for adaptive feature fusion based on spatial confidence and camera distance, and 3) multi-view consistency loss to encourage discriminative feature learning before fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 95.9% IDF1 on WildTrack and 89.2% MODP on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline TrackTacular method.

Conclusion: SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

*Payal Varshney,Adriano Lucieri,Christoph Balada,Sheraz Ahmed,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LD-ViCE is a novel framework that uses latent diffusion models to generate realistic and interpretable counterfactual explanations for video-based AI systems, significantly improving computational efficiency and explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based AI systems in safety-critical domains need interpretable decisions, but current explanation techniques lack temporal coherence, robustness, and causal insights. Existing counterfactual methods don't incorporate model guidance, reducing semantic fidelity.

Method: LD-ViCE operates in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model to reduce computational costs, with an additional refinement step to produce realistic and interpretable counterfactuals that incorporate target model guidance.

Result: LD-ViCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 68% increase in R2 score and 50% reduction in inference time across three diverse video datasets (EchoNet-Dynamic, FERV39k, Something-Something V2). Qualitative analysis confirms semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations.

Conclusion: LD-ViCE represents a significant advancement toward trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical domains by providing efficient, high-quality counterfactual explanations that offer valuable insights into model behavior.

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

*Xia Yue,Anfeng Liu,Ning Chen,Chenjia Huang,Hui Liu,Zhou Huang,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperTTA is a unified framework that enhances hyperspectral image classification robustness against various degradations through a multi-degradation dataset, spectral-spatial transformer classifier, and lightweight test-time adaptation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification models are highly sensitive to distribution shifts caused by real-world degradations like noise, blur, compression, and atmospheric effects, requiring improved robustness.

Method: Constructed multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset with 9 degradation types; designed spectral-spatial transformer classifier with multi-level receptive field and label smoothing; implemented confidence-aware entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter for test-time adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show HyperTTA outperforms existing baselines across various degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances model robustness through both its classification backbone and TTA scheme, enabling dynamic adaptation without source data or target annotations.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

*Ivan Stoyanov,Fabian Bongratz,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SBDM is a novel diffusion model for accurate cortical thickness trajectory forecasting on spherical brain surfaces, achieving superior performance over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of individualized cortical thickness trajectories is crucial for detecting subtle neurodegenerative changes and enabling early intervention, but challenging due to the non-Euclidean geometry of cortex and need for multi-modal data integration.

Method: Proposed Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM) with bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process and conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet) that combines spherical convolutions with dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular data.

Result: SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors compared to previous approaches, validated on ADNI and OASIS longitudinal datasets. Can generate both factual and counterfactual cortical thickness trajectories.

Conclusion: SBDM provides a novel framework for accurate cortical thickness forecasting and exploring hypothetical cortical development scenarios, offering valuable insights for neurodegenerative disease monitoring and intervention.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

*Yujie Zhu,Xinyi Zhang,Yekai Lu,Guang Yang,Faming Fang,Guixu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSSM improves Mamba for super-resolution by incorporating token correlations through first-order hold discretization, achieving state-of-the-art results without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Mamba-based vision models focus on architecture and scan paths but neglect the SSM module itself. The authors want to explore SSM's potential for lightweight super-resolution tasks.

Method: Introduce First-order State Space Model (FSSM) that applies first-order hold condition in SSMs, derives new discretized form, and analyzes cumulative error to enhance token correlations.

Result: FSSM improves MambaIR performance on five benchmark datasets without additional parameters, surpassing current lightweight SR methods and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed FSSM modification successfully enhances SSM performance for vision tasks, demonstrating that optimizing the SSM calculation process itself can yield significant improvements in super-resolution.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [64] [Maximally Useful and Minimally Redundant: The Key to Self Supervised Learning for Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08469)
*Yash Kumar Sharma,Vineet Nair,Wilson Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-view contrastive self-supervised learning method using mutual information theory to improve performance on imbalanced datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) performs well on balanced datasets but struggles with imbalanced datasets. The research addresses this limitation by extending the multi-view framework beyond two views as suggested by Yann LeCun.

Method: Developed a theoretical justification based on mutual information for more than two views, introduced a loss function that segregates intra and inter discriminatory characteristics, and filters out extreme features to learn better representations.

Result: Achieved significant improvements: 2% on Cifar10-LT, 5% on Cifar100-LT, and 3% on Imagenet-LT using ResNet architectures. The method works across both contrastive and non-contrastive self-supervised frameworks.

Conclusion: The multi-view objective with more than two views effectively addresses dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning, enabling better representation learning for tail classes and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified pipeline for prompt-driven image analysis that combines detection, segmentation, inpainting, and description into a single workflow from a single natural language prompt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical, transparent system that converts natural language instructions into multiple image analysis steps with reliable performance and debugging capabilities.

Method: Combines open-vocabulary detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and vision-language description into an end-to-end workflow with both UI and CLI interfaces.

Result: Achieved over 90% usable mask generation with 85% accuracy in single-word prompts; inpainting consumes 60-75% of runtime; provides implementation guidance on thresholds and parameters.

Conclusion: The study presents a reliable pattern for assembling vision and multimodal models with clear operational practices that improve reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal tasks.

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

TL;DR: This review paper systematically analyzes underwater object detection challenges and explores the potential of large vision-language models to address issues like image degradation, small object detection, and dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater object detection faces numerous performance-compromising challenges in marine applications, and existing methods fail to fully capture underwater environmental complexities, necessitating a comprehensive review and exploration of advanced solutions.

Method: The paper categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas, analyzes progression from traditional to modern approaches, explores LVLMs' potential, and presents case studies including synthetic dataset generation with DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM.

Result: Three key insights identified: current UOD methods insufficient for dynamic underwater challenges, LVLM synthetic data generation shows potential but needs refinement, and LVLMs hold promise but real-time applications require further optimization research.

Conclusion: Large vision-language models represent a promising direction for advancing underwater object detection, though significant research is needed to address real-time application constraints and ensure synthetic data realism for practical deployment in marine environments.

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

*Piyush Bagad,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developing time-sensitive video representations that can distinguish temporally opposite actions (chiral pairs) through self-supervised adaptation of frozen image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video embeddings poorly represent simple visual changes over time needed to distinguish chiral actions like opening/closing doors, which occur frequently in daily life.

Method: Self-supervised adaptation recipe using auto-encoder with latent space inspired by perceptual straightening to inject time-sensitivity into frozen image feature sequences.

Result: Outperforms larger video models pre-trained on large-scale datasets and improves classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully creates compact, time-sensitive video representations that effectively handle chiral action recognition across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuMo is a unified Human-Centric Video Generation framework that addresses multimodal coordination challenges through a two-stage training paradigm, specialized strategies for subject preservation and audio-visual sync, and a novel time-adaptive guidance approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HCVG methods struggle to effectively coordinate heterogeneous modalities (text, image, audio) due to scarce paired training data and difficulties in collaborating sub-tasks of subject preservation and audio-visual synchronization.

Method: Two-stage progressive multimodal training: 1) Minimal-invasive image injection for subject preservation, 2) Focus-by-predicting strategy for audio-visual sync with audio cross-attention, plus time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance for inference.

Result: HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks and establishes a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned video generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses multimodal coordination challenges in HCVG through innovative training strategies and achieves superior performance compared to existing specialized methods.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

*Garry Yang,Zizhe Chen,Man Hon Wong,Haoyu Lei,Yongqiang Chen,Zhenguo Li,Kaiwen Zhou,James Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MESH is a new benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in Large Video Models (LVMs) that uses a QA framework with binary and multi-choice formats, following human-like bottom-up video understanding processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video hallucination benchmarks rely on manual categorization and neglect human perception-based interpretation processes, making them inadequate for systematic evaluation of LVMs.

Method: MESH uses Question-Answering framework with target and trap instances, following bottom-up approach: evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs to align with human video understanding.

Result: LVMs perform well on basic objects and features but show significantly increased hallucinations when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions with various subjects in longer videos.

Conclusion: MESH provides an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in LVMs, revealing their limitations in handling complex video content despite strong performance on basic elements.

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

*Eric Slyman,Mehrab Tanjim,Kushal Kafle,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMB improves multimodal judge models for text-to-image evaluation using Bayesian prompt ensembles with image clustering, enhancing accuracy and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM judge models suffer from biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image domains when evaluating text-to-image generation systems.

Method: Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB) - Bayesian prompt ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing dynamic prompt weight assignment based on visual characteristics.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on HPSv2 and MJBench benchmarks, improving alignment with human annotations and calibration across varied image content.

Conclusion: Multimodal-specific strategies like MMB are crucial for reliable judge calibration and represent a promising path for large-scale TTI evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

*Robin-Nico Kampa,Fabian Deuser,Konrad Habel,Norbert Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViewSparsifier approach won both plant age prediction and leaf count estimation tasks in the GroMo Grand Challenge by using multi-view embeddings with random view selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view classification/regression models often fail to capture all information needed for accurate plant phenotypic trait estimation, affecting plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.

Method: Used multi-view dataset with plants photographed from multiple heights and angles. Incorporated 24 views (selection vector) in random selection to learn view-invariant embeddings. Also experimented with randomized view selection across all five height levels (120 views total) using selection matrices.

Result: The ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks (Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation) in the ACM Multimedia 2025 GroMo Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: Multi-view approaches with view-invariant embeddings outperform single-view methods for plant phenotyping. Randomized view selection across multiple heights shows promise for future research improvements.

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

*Wenjun Yu,Yinchen Zhou,Jia-Xuan Jiang,Shubin Zeng,Yuee Li,Zhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EM Aggregation and Text-Guided Pixel Decoder to address multimodal fusion challenges in medical image segmentation, improving cross-modal correspondence and bridging semantic gaps between text and medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models underperform in medical domain due to semantic gap between abstract textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, and resulting feature dispersion.

Method: Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism to cluster features into compact semantic centers, and Text-Guided Pixel Decoder to leverage domain-invariant textual knowledge for guiding visual representations.

Result: Outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization benchmarks on cardiac and fundus datasets.

Conclusion: The synergy between EM Aggregation and Text-Guided Pixel Decoder significantly improves model generalization in medical image segmentation by addressing multimodal fusion challenges.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

TL;DR: GraphTopoNet uses graph learning with Monte Carlo dropout to create accurate Greenland subglacial bed maps from sparse radar data, reducing errors by up to 60% compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are crucial for sea-level projections, but existing radar observations are sparse and unevenly distributed, limiting reliability for climate forecasting.

Method: A graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision with Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty modeling. Uses spatial graphs from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) with gradient features and polynomial trends.

Result: Outperforms interpolation, convolutional, and graph-based baselines in three Greenland subregions, reducing error by up to 60% while preserving fine-scale glacial features.

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet demonstrates how graph machine learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable knowledge at continental scale, improving reliability for operational climate modeling and policy support.

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an implicit shape prior method to reduce manual segmentation workload in medical 3D imaging by using sparse slice annotations and automatically selecting the most informative slices for multi-organ segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the manual workload for medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks like radiotherapy planning and degenerative disease diagnosis, where organs at risk must be accurately identified and muscular mass measurements require manual segmentation.

Method: The paper proposes an implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations generalized for multi-organ cases, along with a framework for automatically selecting the most informative slices to minimize subsequent interactions.

Result: Experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation of at-risk organs for brain cancer patients and accelerating database creation for patients with sarcopenia with unseen muscle shapes.

Conclusion: The approach successfully reduces manual segmentation burden in medical imaging by leveraging sparse annotations and intelligent slice selection, demonstrating practical value in radiotherapy planning and degenerative disease diagnosis applications.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

TL;DR: Proposes EfficientIML model with EfficientRWKV backbone for detecting diffusion-based image manipulations in high-resolution images, outperforming existing methods in localization accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image forgery detectors lack exposure to diffusion-based manipulations and struggle with high-resolution images due to computational constraints.

Method: Uses lightweight EfficientRWKV backbone combining state-space and attention networks, with multi-scale supervision for hierarchical prediction consistency.

Result: Outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in localization performance, FLOPs, and inference speed on the proposed SIF dataset.

Conclusion: The approach is suitable for real-time forensic applications, effectively addressing the challenge of detecting diffusion-based manipulations in high-resolution imagery.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Shahrooz Faghihroohi,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLAPS is a unified automated segmentation method for retinal imaging that combines CLIP-based image encoding, automatic bounding box prompts from GroundingDINO, and modality-specific text prompts to guide SAM for precise segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image segmentation methods face modality ambiguity in disease descriptions, reliance on manual prompting for SAM workflows, and lack of unified frameworks that work across different modalities and tasks in retinal imaging.

Method: Pre-train CLIP-based image encoder on multi-modal retinal data, use GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting lesions, employ text prompts with modality signatures to resolve ambiguity, and guide SAM for automated segmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across 11 segmentation categories show CLAPS achieves performance comparable to specialized expert models and surpasses existing benchmarks across most metrics.

Conclusion: CLAPS demonstrates broad generalizability as a foundation model, providing a fully automated and unified pipeline for precise segmentation across diverse retinal imaging tasks and modalities without manual intervention.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdsQA, a novel benchmark using advertisement videos to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive marketing logic and persuasive strategies beyond basic visual content. The authors also propose ReAd-R, an RL-based model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this challenging task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend LLMs' specialized applications by using ad videos as a challenging test-bed that requires understanding marketing logic, persuasive strategies, and audience engagement beyond basic visual perception.

Method: Created AdsQA benchmark with 1,544 ad videos (10,962 clips, 22.7 hours) featuring 5 challenging tasks. Proposed ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that reflects on questions and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.

Result: Benchmarked 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA. ReAd-R achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong competitors with long-chain reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

Conclusion: Ad videos provide a rich, challenging domain for evaluating LLMs' advanced perception capabilities. The proposed ReAd-R model demonstrates effective performance on marketing-oriented video QA tasks, showing promise for specialized LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

### [78] [UOPSL: Unpaired OCT Predilection Sites Learning for Fundus Image Diagnosis Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08624)
*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Daniel Zapp,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unpaired multimodal framework called UOPSL that uses OCT-derived spatial priors to enhance fundus image-based disease recognition without requiring paired multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images (fundus + OCT) is expensive and limited, with modality imbalance issues. Conventional single-modality approaches fail to capture fine-grained spatial information from different imaging modalities.

Method: UOPSL uses contrastive learning on unpaired OCT and fundus images to learn predilection sites matrix in OCT latent space. This matrix captures lesion localization patterns and is used during fundus-only classification when OCT data is unavailable.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 diverse datasets across 28 critical categories show the framework outperforms existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges unpaired fundus and OCT data using spatial priors, enabling improved disease recognition from fundus images alone while overcoming the limitations of expensive paired multimodal data acquisition.

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADB is a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample translation that uses partially paired data to bridge domain gaps without requiring full supervision or exhaustive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle in data-scarce domains where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are required. Current methods either lack controllability (unpaired) or need large domain-specific datasets (fully paired).

Method: Aligns source and target distributions in shared latent space, integrating pretrained source-domain diffusion models with target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM) trained on partially paired latent representations.

Result: Superior performance in depth-to-image translation under partial supervision, successfully extended to multi-source translation (depth maps + segmentation masks) and multi-target translation in class-conditioned style transfer.

Conclusion: LADB provides a scalable and versatile solution for real-world domain translation, particularly effective when data annotation is costly or incomplete, balancing fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

TL;DR: DSLNet introduces a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture for isolated sign language recognition that separates gesture shape and trajectory modeling using wrist-centric and facial-centric coordinate systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISLR methods struggle with morphologically similar but semantically distinct gestures due to geometric ambiguity from using single reference frames, which fail to properly separate hand shape from motion trajectory.

Method: Dual-reference dual-stream architecture with wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling, using topology-aware graph convolution for shape and Finsler geometry encoder for trajectory, integrated via geometry-driven optimal transport fusion.

Result: Achieved 93.70% accuracy on WLASL-100, 89.97% on WLASL-300, and 99.79% on LSA64 datasets, setting new state-of-the-art with significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Conclusion: DSLNet successfully addresses geometric ambiguity in sign language recognition by decoupling shape and trajectory modeling in complementary coordinate systems, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the

TL;DR: FractalPINN-Flow is an unsupervised deep learning framework for optical flow estimation that learns from consecutive grayscale frames without ground truth, using a fractal-inspired recursive encoder-decoder architecture with TV regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an optical flow estimation method that doesn't require ground truth annotations and can handle high-resolution data effectively, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.

Method: Uses Fractal Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder with repeated nesting and skip connections inspired by fractal geometry. Minimizes energy functional with L1/L2 data fidelity terms for brightness constancy and total variation regularization for spatial smoothness.

Result: Produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow fields. Effective for high-resolution data and scenarios with limited annotations, as demonstrated on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The fractal-inspired architecture combined with variational formulation provides an effective unsupervised approach for optical flow estimation that performs well without ground truth supervision.

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Method: Systematic exploration of computational imaging techniques including light field imaging, HDR imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare mitigation, and their synergies with core CV tasks.

Result: Analysis reveals relationships between CI methods and their practical contributions to CV applications, highlighting opportunities for improved robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Potential for task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that enhance performance in real-world scenarios like autonomous navigation, surveillance, AR, and robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deployment challenges of large MLLMs in resource-constrained environments by developing energy-efficient, computationally scalable models for real-world applications.

Method: Proposes BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model (BcQLM) - a compact vision-language encoder optimized for efficient multimodal understanding with modular and extensible design.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to standard-size MLLMs while significantly reducing computational costs, validated on multiple datasets with effective balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: BcQLM offers a promising path toward deployable multimodal large language models under practical hardware constraints, enabling broader multimodal task generalization.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

*Marius Dähling,Sebastian Krebs,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrowdQuery (CQ) is a novel method that enhances transformer-based detectors by embedding object density maps into decoder queries, improving crowd detection in both 2D and 3D without additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd detection methods struggle with crowded scenes where object density varies significantly. Current density map definitions are limited to head positions or spatial statistics, lacking consideration of individual bounding box dimensions.

Method: Proposes CQ module that predicts and embeds object density maps, then integrates this density information into decoder queries. Creates density-guided queries that improve detection in crowded environments. Introduces CQ2D and CQ3D architectures for 2D and 3D detection respectively.

Result: Significant performance improvements on STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods. Further improves performance on CrowdHuman dataset when integrated with existing crowd detectors.

Conclusion: CQ effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in crowded environments, is universally applicable without additional data, and demonstrates strong generalizability across different datasets and detection domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

*Lena Wild,Rafael Valencia,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArgoTweak is the first dataset providing realistic map priors, current maps, and sensor data to address the sim2real gap in HD mapping, enabling accurate change detection and integration through fine-grained atomic modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on synthetic priors due to lack of public datasets with the required triplet of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data, leading to inconsistencies and significant sim2real gap.

Method: Employs a bijective mapping framework that breaks down large-scale map modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, ensuring interpretability and preserving unchanged elements with high fidelity.

Result: Training models on ArgoTweak significantly reduces the sim2real gap compared to using synthetic priors, with extensive ablations highlighting the impact of structured priors and detailed change annotations.

Conclusion: ArgoTweak establishes a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD mapping and advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions by providing realistic data for reliable integration of prior information.

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework using mobile phone images achieves 86% accuracy for arsenicosis diagnosis, outperforming CNNs with Transformer models and providing explainable AI for clinical use in resource-limited areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arsenicosis is a serious public health issue in Asia caused by contaminated water, with early skin manifestations often underdiagnosed in rural areas lacking dermatologists. Automated image-based diagnosis can enable early detection and timely interventions.

Method: End-to-end framework using mobile phone-captured skin images with 20 classes and over 11,000 images. Benchmarked CNN and Transformer models, integrated LIME and Grad-CAM for interpretability, and developed web-based diagnostic tool.

Result: Transformer models significantly outperformed CNNs, with Swin Transformer achieving 86% accuracy. Visualizations confirmed models focused on lesion-relevant regions. Strong performance on external validation demonstrated generalization capability.

Conclusion: The framework shows deep learning's potential for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable arsenicosis diagnosis from mobile images, serving as practical diagnostic aid in resource-limited communities for early detection and intervention.

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

### [88] [Quantifying Accuracy of an Event-Based Star Tracker via Earth's Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08794)
*Dennis Melamed,Connor Hashemi,Scott McCloskey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-based cameras achieve 18.47 arcseconds RMS accuracy for star tracking by using Earth's rotation as ground truth, demonstrating potential for low-cost, low-latency attitude determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of obtaining accurate ground truth for event-based camera star tracking systems and validate their performance against established Earth rotation measurements.

Method: Using a static event camera mounted on a ground-based telescope pointed at the night sky, capturing event streams where the only motion is Earth's rotation. Orientation estimates are compared against IERS-measured Earth orientation data.

Result: Achieved root mean squared error of 18.47 arcseconds and about error of 78.84 arcseconds, showing competitive accuracy while benefiting from event cameras' advantages like sparser data, higher dynamic range, and lower energy consumption.

Conclusion: Event-based cameras are viable for low-cost, low-latency star tracking applications, with accuracy sufficient for many attitude determination needs while offering computational and power efficiency advantages over traditional framing sensors.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

*Matthieu Vilain,Rémi Giraud,Yannick Berthoumieu,Guillaume Bourmaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAMER introduces a beam search strategy for dense image matching that preserves multiple correspondent hypotheses per pixel across scales, improving robustness at depth discontinuities and strong zoom-in scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dense matching methods produce only one correspondent hypothesis per pixel at each scale, which fails in challenging cases like depth discontinuities or strong zoom-in where neighboring correspondences are widely spread, leading to erroneous matches.

Method: Proposes a beam search strategy to propagate multiple hypotheses at each scale and integrates these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, creating a novel architecture called BEAMER that learns to preserve and propagate multiple correspondences across scales.

Result: BEAMER is significantly more robust than state-of-the-art methods, particularly at depth discontinuities and when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Conclusion: Predicting and propagating multiple correspondent hypotheses per source location at each scale through beam search and cross-attention integration substantially improves dense image matching performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeneVA is a large-scale annotated dataset for benchmarking spatio-temporal artifacts in text-to-video generation models, addressing the lack of systematic video evaluation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on image generation, but video generation introduces unique spatio-temporal complexities and artifacts that need systematic evaluation to improve model quality.

Method: Created a large-scale artifact dataset (GeneVA) with rich human annotations specifically for spatio-temporal artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts.

Result: Developed a comprehensive benchmark dataset that enables systematic evaluation of text-to-video generation models, focusing on identifying impossible physics and temporal inconsistencies.

Conclusion: GeneVA bridges the gap in video generation evaluation and will enable critical applications like benchmarking model performance and improving generative video quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

### [91] [RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08826)
*Jie Wu,Yu Gao,Zilyu Ye,Ming Li,Liang Li,Hanzhong Guo,Jie Liu,Zeyue Xue,Xiaoxia Hou,Wei Liu,Yan Zeng,Weilin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RewardDance introduces a scalable generative reward modeling framework that aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures, enabling scaling to 26B parameters and resolving reward hacking issues in visual generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models for visual generation face limitations: CLIP-based RMs have architectural constraints, Bradley-Terry losses misalign with VLM next-token prediction, and RLHF suffers from reward hacking where models exploit flawed reward signals without improving true quality.

Method: RewardDance reformulates reward scoring as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token indicating generated image outperforms reference image. This generative reward paradigm intrinsically aligns with VLM architectures and enables scaling across model size (up to 26B parameters) and context (task instructions, references, chain-of-thought reasoning).

Result: RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Large-scale RMs maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving resistance to reward hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: The framework resolves persistent reward hacking challenges, greatly relieves mode collapse problems in smaller models, and provides a scalable solution for reward modeling in visual generation tasks through architectural alignment and systematic scaling capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

TL;DR: Novel approach combining 3D geometry reconstruction and appearance estimation for fabrics using single monocular RGB video, with physical simulation and differentiable rendering achieving 2.64x error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing 3D dynamic scenes, particularly fabrics, using only monocular RGB video while overcoming depth ambiguity problems in monocular reconstruction.

Method: Combines physical simulation of cloth geometry with differentiable rendering, introduces two novel regularization terms for 3D reconstruction to improve plausibility and address depth ambiguity.

Result: Reduced 3D reconstruction error by factor of 2.64 compared to recent methods, with medium runtime of 30 min per scene. Optimized motion quality enables appearance estimation recovering sharp details from single video.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully performs both 3D reconstruction and appearance estimation for fabrics using monocular video, achieving significant error reduction and high-quality results suitable for physically based rendering.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning with task-specific feedback effectively addresses generalization issues in visual localization, making it more robust for large-scale outdoor applications.

Abstract: Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance
often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like
lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges
degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual navigation relies on computationally expensive globally-consistent 3D maps or learned controllers that are difficult to generalize across diverse environments

Method: Integrates global topological path planning with local metric trajectory control using monocular depth and traversability estimation, with auto-switching fallback to baseline controller

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real-world tests, demonstrating robustness and deployability

Conclusion: Provides a more adaptable and effective solution for visual navigation in open-set environments using foundational models without domain-specific fine-tuning

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

TL;DR: SocialNav-SUB benchmark evaluates VLMs' social navigation scene understanding, finding they underperform rule-based and human baselines despite promising capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot navigation in human environments requires social compliance and robust scene understanding. While VLMs show promise with object recognition and reasoning, their ability to understand complex social navigation scenes remains unproven.

Method: Introduces Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a VQA dataset evaluating VLMs across spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning tasks in real-world social robot navigation scenarios.

Result: Best-performing VLM shows encouraging agreement with human answers but still underperforms simpler rule-based approaches and human consensus baselines, revealing critical gaps in social scene understanding.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in social navigation scene understanding. The benchmark provides a framework for future research to tailor VLMs for real-world social robot navigation needs.

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be

TL;DR: X-Part is a controllable generative model for 3D part-level shape generation that uses bounding box prompts and semantic features to create structurally coherent parts with high geometric fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing part-based generation methods lack sufficient controllability and suffer from poor semantically meaningful decomposition, which is crucial for downstream applications like mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing.

Method: X-Part exploits bounding box prompts for part generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful decomposition. It also includes an editable pipeline for interactive part generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that X-Part achieves state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation, creating production-ready, editable, and structurally sound 3D assets.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for controllable part-based 3D shape generation with high semantic coherence and geometric fidelity, with codes to be released for public research.

Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications
such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing
part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer
from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce
X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D
object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high
geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part
generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful
decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part
generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves
state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work
establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and
structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research.

### [99] [XML Prompting as Grammar-Constrained Interaction: Fixed-Point Semantics, Convergence Guarantees, and Human-AI Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08182)
*Faruk Alpay,Taylan Alpay*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: A mathematical framework for XML prompting that unifies grammar-constrained decoding, fixed-point semantics, and human-AI interaction loops, with proven convergence properties and practical deployment patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a formal mathematical foundation for structured prompting with XML tags that can steer large language models toward parseable, schema-adherent outputs in real-world systems.

Method: Developed a logic-first treatment with complete lattice theory for XML trees under refinement order, proved fixed-point theorems (Knaster-Tarski and Banach-style convergence), instantiated with context-free grammars for XML schemas, and demonstrated multi-layer human-AI interaction recipes.

Result: Created a unified framework that guarantees well-formed XML outputs while preserving task performance, with mathematically complete proofs and practical deployment patterns including multi-pass routines and agentic tool use.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications, connecting to recent advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic prompting for reliable structured outputs from LLMs.

Abstract: Structured prompting with XML tags has emerged as an effective way to steer
large language models (LLMs) toward parseable, schema-adherent outputs in
real-world systems. We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that
unifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over
lattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction
loops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order
and prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points
(Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware
contraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of
iterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars
(CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees
well-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer
human-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns,
including multi-pass "plan $\to$ verify $\to$ revise" routines and agentic tool
use. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent
advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic
prompting.

### [100] [EvolKV: Evolutionary KV Cache Compression for LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08315)
*Bohan Yu,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvolKV is an adaptive framework that uses evolutionary search to optimize layer-wise KV cache compression, achieving better performance than heuristic methods while using significantly less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods rely on heuristics that ignore layer-specific feature patterns and task performance interactions, leading to degraded generalization.

Method: Reformulates cache allocation as multi-objective optimization problem and uses evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while maximizing downstream performance.

Result: Outperforms all baseline methods on 11 tasks, achieves up to 7% improvement on GSM8K, and surpasses full KV cache performance on code completion using only 1.5% of original budget.

Conclusion: EvolKV demonstrates the untapped potential of learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation, showing superior memory efficiency and task performance over heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

*Minqi Jiang,João G. M. Araújo,Will Ellsworth,Sian Gooding,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDR framework uses generative models to transform problematic datasets into safe training data, addressing data scarcity while preserving privacy and content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address projected data exhaustion by enabling safe use of user-generated content that contains private information and undesirable content.

Method: Generative Data Refinement (GDR) uses pretrained generative models to transform datasets with undesirable content into refined training datasets through conditional synthetic data generation.

Result: Outperforms industry-grade anonymization solutions, enables detoxification of unsafe datasets, and matches web-scale dataset diversity without complex prompting.

Conclusion: GDR provides a simple and effective solution to scale training data for frontier models while mitigating privacy and content risks.

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AgentGym-RL is a new reinforcement learning framework for training LLM agents from scratch without supervised fine-tuning, featuring modular architecture and supporting diverse real-world scenarios with a novel ScalingInter-RL training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks a unified interactive RL framework to train autonomous LLM agents from scratch across diverse environments without relying on supervised fine-tuning, which limits agent development and knowledge acquisition through exploration.

Method: Introduces AgentGym-RL framework with modular architecture and proposes ScalingInter-RL training approach that balances exploration-exploitation by gradually increasing interaction horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework and approach are stable and effective, with agents matching or surpassing commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective training of intelligent LLM agents through RL, provides key insights, and will be open-sourced to empower research community development of next-generation autonomous agents.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

*Zhanming Shen,Zeyu Qin,Zenan Huang,Hao Chen,Jiaqi Hu,Yihong Zhuang,Guoshan Lu,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) is a lightweight framework that efficiently distills reasoning capabilities from multiple teachers into compact students by alternating teacher-specific fine-tuning and weight-space merging, achieving superior performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning distillation assumes a single oracle teacher, but multiple candidate teachers are practically available. Different students have different best teachers, and the best teacher can vary across datasets, creating a need to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities while overcoming supervision conflicts.

Method: Propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) framework that alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples.

Result: MoT applied to Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B, QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1 on competition math benchmarks. Consistently outperforms best single-teacher distillation and naive multi-teacher union, mitigates overfitting, shows robustness to distribution shifts, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and improves general reasoning beyond mathematics.

Conclusion: MoT provides a simple, scalable route to efficiently distill long chain-of-thought capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students, with consensus-filtered reasoning features transferring broadly across domains.

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

*Federico Fontana,Anxhelo Diko,Romeo Lanzino,Marco Raoul Marini,Bachir Kaddar,Gian Luca Foresti,Luigi Cinque*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deepfake detection reframed as continual learning problem with efficient framework that adapts to new manipulation techniques while retaining past knowledge, featuring novel metrics and extensive testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of frequent retraining needed for deepfake detection systems due to rapidly evolving generation technologies by applying continual learning principles.

Method: Proposed continual learning framework that simulates real-world chronological evolution of deepfake technologies over 7 years, using lightweight visual backbones for real-time performance and introducing two novel metrics (C-AUC and FWT-AUC).

Result: Achieved efficient adaptation (155x faster than full retraining) with robust historical knowledge retention, but found near-random generalization to future generators without additional training (FWT-AUC ≈ 0.5) due to unique generator imprints.

Conclusion: Current approaches can efficiently adapt to new deepfake technologies while retaining past knowledge, but generalization to unseen future generators remains challenging, leading to the proposed Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

*Dikshant Sagar,Kaiwen Yu,Alejandro Yankelevich,Jianming Bian,Pierre Baldi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vision Language Models (VLMs) outperform CNNs in neutrino interaction classification, offering better performance, interpretability, and multimodal reasoning capabilities for high-energy physics experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of Vision Language Models (specifically fine-tuned LLaMa 3.2) for identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics experiments, benchmarking against state-of-the-art CNN architectures used in experiments like NOvA and DUNE.

Method: Fine-tuned a Vision Language Model (LLaMa 3.2 variant) and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures similar to those used in NOvA and DUNE experiments. Evaluation considered both classification performance and interpretability of model predictions.

Result: VLMs can outperform CNNs in classifying electron and muon neutrino events while providing greater flexibility for integrating auxiliary textual/semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions.

Conclusion: VLMs show strong potential as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, opening new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: LLMs show Dunning-Kruger effect in fact-checking: smaller models are overconfident but inaccurate, while larger models are more accurate but less confident, with performance gaps worse for non-English and Global South claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of misinformation requires scalable fact-checking solutions, but LLM effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain, especially for diverse languages and regions.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 9 LLMs using 5,000 claims assessed by 174 professional fact-checkers across 47 languages, testing generalizability on post-training claims and 4 prompting strategies with 240,000 human annotations as ground truth.

Result: Smaller models show high confidence but low accuracy, while larger models have higher accuracy but lower confidence. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and Global South claims.

Conclusion: Results establish a multilingual benchmark and provide evidence for policy to ensure equitable access to trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking, addressing systemic bias risks in information verification.

Abstract: The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable
fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in
automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts
remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across
multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures,
reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional
fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model
generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting
strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions,
with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a
concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible
models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models
demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in
information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use
smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages
and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing
information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for
future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring
equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance on LLMs must become central to research and deployment, highlighting risks at individual and societal levels, identifying contributing factors, and proposing measurement improvements and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly influence consequential decisions across diverse domains, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities - grows, potentially leading to high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling.

Method: The paper consolidates risks from overreliance, explores LLM characteristics and system design features that contribute to overreliance, examines historical approaches for measuring overreliance, and identifies gaps in current measurement methods.

Result: The analysis reveals three important gaps in current overreliance measurement approaches and proposes three promising directions to improve measurement, along with mitigation strategies for the AI research community.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that ensuring LLMs augment rather than undermine human capabilities requires making overreliance measurement and mitigation central to LLM research and deployment practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) distinguish themselves from previous
technologies by functioning as collaborative "thought partners," capable of
engaging more fluidly in natural language. As LLMs increasingly influence
consequential decisions across diverse domains from healthcare to personal
advice, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities -
grows. This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance
must become central to LLM research and deployment. First, we consolidate risks
from overreliance at both the individual and societal levels, including
high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Then, we
explore LLM characteristics, system design features, and user cognitive biases
that - together - raise serious and unique concerns about overreliance in
practice. We also examine historical approaches for measuring overreliance,
identifying three important gaps and proposing three promising directions to
improve measurement. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies that the AI
research community can pursue to ensure LLMs augment rather than undermine
human capabilities.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a benchmark to measure how AI systems support human agency across six dimensions, finding low-to-moderate agency support in current LLM assistants with significant variation across developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly steer human decision-making, there's a risk of losing individual and collective control. The paper addresses the need to measure and ensure AI systems preserve human agency rather than manipulate or undermine it.

Method: Developed HumanAgencyBench (HAB) - a scalable benchmark using LLMs to simulate user queries and evaluate AI responses across six agency dimensions: Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries.

Result: Found low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants with substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. Anthropic LLMs showed best overall agency support but were weakest in Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support doesn't consistently correlate with increasing LLM capabilities or RLHF.

Conclusion: Current AI systems need improvement in supporting human agency. The research encourages a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets that specifically address agency preservation rather than relying solely on capability improvements or instruction-following enhancements.

Abstract: As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI),
we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively
simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social
media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly
scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea
of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency
with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to
simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop
HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions
of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an
AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation,
Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and
Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in
contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system
developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human
agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value
Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from
increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and
we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: StrokeVision-Bench is the first dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block transfer tasks (Box and Block Test) with 1,000 annotated videos in two modalities, addressing gaps in existing datasets for automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical assessment of upper extremity function after stroke is subjective and lacks sensitivity for detecting subtle motor improvements. Existing datasets focus on daily living activities rather than clinically structured assessments, and often mix healthy and stroke-affected individuals, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Created StrokeVision-Bench dataset with 1,000 annotated videos of stroke patients performing block transfer tasks, categorized into four clinically meaningful action classes. Each sample includes raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. Benchmarked state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action classification methods.

Result: The paper introduces a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for stroke rehabilitation assessment, providing performance baselines for automated analysis of clinically structured motor function tests.

Conclusion: StrokeVision-Bench addresses critical gaps in existing datasets and enables objective, quantitative assessment of upper extremity motor function in stroke patients, facilitating future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

Abstract: Despite advancements in rehabilitation protocols, clinical assessment of
upper extremity (UE) function after stroke largely remains subjective, relying
heavily on therapist observation and coarse scoring systems. This subjectivity
limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements,
which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in
computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative,
and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box
and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity
and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself
well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke
rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to
capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks.
Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and
stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility.
To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever
dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block
transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized
into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in
two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark
several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action
classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and
facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

TL;DR: Expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework that integrates radiologist ROIs with Grad-CAM supervision to improve both classification accuracy and interpretability in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces challenges due to limited expert-annotated data, hindering model generalization and clinical adoption. There's a need to bridge the gap between performance and interpretability.

Method: Proposes an expert-guided framework that integrates radiologist-provided ROIs with Grad-CAM spatial attention supervision. Uses explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention with diagnostic regions, jointly optimized with prototypical network objective.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements: from 77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS (MRI) and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR. Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed consistent alignment of attention with diagnostic regions.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert-guided attention supervision effectively bridges the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical image diagnosis, improving both predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness.

Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited
expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical
adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework
that integrates radiologist-provided regions-of-interests (ROIs) into model
training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and
interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we
introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention
with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is
jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging
the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data
conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and
VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from
77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to
non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided
training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both
predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to
bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical
image diagnosis.

TL;DR: Automated deep learning tool accurately measures global cerebral atrophy from CT scans, showing strong agreement with human raters and correlations with age/cognitive impairment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain atrophy quantification requires time-consuming visual rating scales, warranting automated analysis tools for efficient and standardized measurement.

Method: Developed and validated a deep learning tool using CT-brain scans from older patients (>65 years), with 60/20/20 split for training/optimization/testing, comparing against trained human raters using MAE and Cohen's weighted kappa.

Result: DL tool achieved MAE of 3.2 overall with human raters, showed no significant score differences (p=0.35 ANOVA), and correlated significantly with age and cognitive scores (p<0.001). Inter-rater agreement was comparable between DL tool and humans.

Conclusion: The DL tool provides accurate, automated GCA scoring without user input, enabling standardized quantitative atrophy measurement at scale for health research and potential clinical point-of-care applications.

Abstract: Quantification of brain atrophy currently requires visual rating scales which
are time consuming and automated brain image analysis is warranted. We
validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral
Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and
cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain
scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke
(OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for
training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained
raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL
tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated
using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans
(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and
rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6
for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.
Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41
between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and
rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two
raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and
rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18)
or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated
with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool
measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans
acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised
quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and
will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool.

*Karim Kadry,Shoaib Goraya,Ajay Manicka,Abdalla Abdelwahed,Farhad Nezami,Elazer Edelman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A programmable framework using ellipsoidal primitives to guide 3D anatomical diffusion models, enabling independent control over size, shape, position, and multi-component constraints while maintaining anatomical realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models of 3D anatomy face a trade-off between controllability and anatomical realism, limiting their effectiveness for clinical research and medical device design where precise control over anatomical structures is needed.

Method: Uses interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space to guide unconditional diffusion models. Applies geometric moment losses on selected tissues within multi-tissue segmentation maps during the reverse diffusion process.

Result: The framework achieves independent control over size, shape, and position of anatomical structures, and supports composition of multi-component constraints during inference without sacrificing anatomical realism.

Conclusion: This approach provides a programmable and compositional method for generating realistic 3D anatomical models with precise control, bridging the gap between controllability and anatomical fidelity in generative modeling of human anatomy.

Abstract: Generative models of 3D anatomy, when integrated with biophysical simulators,
enable the study of structure-function relationships for clinical research and
medical device design. However, current models face a trade-off between
controllability and anatomical realism. We propose a programmable and
compositional framework for guiding unconditional diffusion models of human
anatomy using interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space. Our
method involves the selection of certain tissues within multi-tissue
segmentation maps, upon which we apply geometric moment losses to guide the
reverse diffusion process. This framework supports the independent control over
size, shape, and position, as well as the composition of multi-component
constraints during inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in biomedical CT scan analysis including data privacy concerns, limited computing resources, and data heterogeneity while enabling real-time collaboration between cloud servers and CT scanners.

Method: Proposes Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) framework using pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes, with evaluation metrics including convergence time, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

Result: FTL outperforms conventional Federated Learning and Clustered Federated Learning methods with better precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score, particularly effective for non-IID data distributions.

Conclusion: FTL provides reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical diagnosis, enabling improved decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis and opening new possibilities for precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

Abstract: The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL)
has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis,
particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm.
FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve
problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data
heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between
cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient
identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess
model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than
conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in
settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed
(non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical
diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve
decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient
medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for
applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

### [114] [Physics-Guided Rectified Flow for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08330)
*Juntai Zeng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A physics-guided rectified flow framework (PGRF) for low-light RAW image enhancement that combines a novel composite noise model with per-pixel calibration and generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic datasets for low-light RAW enhancement only consider additive noise and use global calibration, failing to capture real sensor noise characteristics including multiplicative components and pixel-level manufacturing variations.

Method: Proposes a composite noise model integrating additive and multiplicative noise, with physics-based per-pixel noise simulation and calibration. Combines this with a rectified flow generative framework (PGRF) that uses physical guidance to steer generation toward clean images.

Result: Significant improvements in low-light RAW image enhancement demonstrated on the newly established LLID dataset captured with Sony A7S II camera.

Conclusion: The proposed PGRF framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by accurately modeling real sensor noise through physics-based per-pixel calibration and leveraging rectified flow generative capabilities for superior low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging
task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from
using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic
datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but
existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative
components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level
manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately
reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a
noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low
illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive
and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per
pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes
noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of
traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced
by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong
performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we
further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow
generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework
for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows
to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the
generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark
captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image
enhancement.

*Prashant Singh Basnet,Roshan Chitrakar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-ViT model achieves best performance on limited and imbalanced medical datasets, outperforming standalone CNN and ViT with high recall and consistent F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the architectural strengths of hybrid CNN-ViT models when trained from scratch on limited and imbalanced medical datasets, addressing the challenge of small training data with class imbalance.

Method: Proposed a hybrid CNN-ViT architecture trained from scratch on varied data fractions (balanced and imbalanced datasets), with comparative experiments against standalone CNN and ViT models.

Result: Hybrid model achieved highest recall of 0.9443 (50% balanced data) and consistent F1 score around 0.85, outperformed CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets, and required comparable training time to transformers despite complex architecture.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-ViT model demonstrates reliability in medical diagnosis tasks, effectively complementing the strengths of both architectures while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to transformers.

Abstract: This research explored the hybridization of CNN and ViT within a training
dataset of limited size, and introduced a distinct class imbalance. The
training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and
experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid
model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced
and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model,
complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of
0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85,
suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in
outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex
architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all
data fractions.

### [116] [RoentMod: A Synthetic Chest X-Ray Modification Model to Identify and Correct Image Interpretation Model Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08640)
*Lauren H. Cooke,Matthias Jung,Jan M. Brendel,Nora M. Kerkovits,Borek Foldyna,Michael T. Lu,Vineet K. Raghu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RoentMod is a counterfactual image editing framework that generates realistic chest X-rays with synthetic pathology to detect and correct shortcut learning in AI models, improving model performance by 3-19% AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for chest X-ray interpretation are vulnerable to shortcut learning, where they rely on spurious correlations rather than clinically relevant features, limiting their specificity and reliability.

Method: Combines open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with image-to-image modification model to create anatomically realistic CXRs with user-specified synthetic pathology while preserving original anatomical features.

Result: RoentMod images appeared realistic in 93% of cases, correctly incorporated specified findings in 89-99% of cases. Using it revealed state-of-the-art models exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts. Training with counterfactual images improved model discrimination by 3-19% AUC internally and 1-11% for 5/6 pathologies externally.

Conclusion: RoentMod is an effective tool for probing and correcting shortcut learning in medical AI, enhancing robustness and interpretability of CXR interpretation models, and provides a generalizable strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

Abstract: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine.
Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand
access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models
have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to
shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations
rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce
RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically
realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving
unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an
open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image
modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with
board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images
appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified
finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real
follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task
and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,
limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual
images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model
discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation
and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These
findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and
correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled
counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and
interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable
strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.
