### [1] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark (LUCARIO) and framework for probabilistic QA over tabular data is introduced, combining Bayesian Networks, natural language query translation, and LLMs for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems like NL2SQL struggle with probabilistic questions requiring reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: Induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and uses LLMs for answer generation.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements over baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances probabilistic QA, addressing limitations of current systems.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [2] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques static benchmarks for evaluating multi-lingual competence in LLMs and introduces functional benchmarks (CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval) to better assess practical performance and robustness across languages. Results show varying performance drops between static and functional benchmarks, with some languages (e.g., Arabic, English) performing more consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks like Belebele, M-MMLU, and M-GSM inadequately evaluate practical multi-lingual performance and robustness in LLMs.

Method: Created functional benchmarks (CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval) by translating existing English templates to five languages (French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, Yoruba).

Result: Performance drops between static and functional benchmarks vary (e.g., 24% for M-GSM vs. CL-GSM Symbolic in English). Arabic and English show the most consistent performance.

Conclusion: Functional benchmarks provide a better understanding of multi-lingual competence, revealing significant performance gaps and robustness variations across languages.

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [3] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated research ideas initially seem more novel than human ideas, but after execution, their quality drops significantly, revealing a gap between ideation and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI-generated research ideas lead to better outcomes when executed, compared to human-generated ideas.

Method: 43 expert researchers executed randomly assigned ideas (LLM or human-generated), spent 100+ hours implementing them, and wrote short papers. Blind reviews compared scores before and after execution.

Result: LLM-generated ideas scored significantly lower post-execution on novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall metrics (p < 0.05), reversing initial rankings.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to generate truly effective research ideas, and evaluating ideas without execution is challenging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

### [4] [MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821)
*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG is a multimodal RAG framework for financial QA, improving accuracy by 19% over ChatGPT-4o by integrating text, tables, and images with efficient retrieval and cross-modal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial documents combine diverse modalities (text, tables, figures), challenging traditional LLMs and RAG pipelines due to token limits and fragmented context.

Method: MultiFinRAG uses a lightweight multimodal LLM for extraction, generates JSON/text summaries, indexes with modality-aware retrieval, and employs a tiered fallback strategy for cross-modal reasoning.

Result: Achieves 19% higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o on complex financial QA tasks.

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG effectively addresses multimodal challenges in financial QA, outperforming existing methods on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

### [5] [Uncovering Hidden Violent Tendencies in LLMs: A Demographic Analysis via Behavioral Vignettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20822)
*Quintin Myers,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' ability to handle morally ambiguous violent content using a social science tool (VBVQ) and persona-based prompting, revealing discrepancies in their responses compared to human behavior and biases across demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine LLMs' reasoning in morally ambiguous, real-world violent scenarios and assess potential biases in their responses.

Method: Used the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ) and persona-based prompting (varying race, age, geographic identity) to evaluate six LLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Result: LLMs' surface-level text generation often mismatches their internal violent response preferences, and their violent tendencies vary across demographics, contradicting established research.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit biases and inconsistencies in handling violent content, highlighting the need for further scrutiny and alignment with human ethical standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

### [6] [Decide less, communicate more: On the construct validity of end-to-end fact-checking in medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20876)
*Sebastian Joseph,Lily Chen,Barry Wei,Michael Mackert,Iain J. Marshall,Paul Pu Liang,Ramez Kouzy,Byron C. Wallace,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines challenges in applying end-to-end fact-checking systems to medicine, highlighting issues like claim-evidence mismatches and subjective veracity labels, and suggests treating fact-checking as an interactive communication problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high-stakes nature of medical decisions and the inadequacy of medical literacy among users drive interest in automated fact-checking, yet such systems remain underutilized.

Method: The study analyzes how clinical experts verify real social media claims by synthesizing medical evidence, identifying challenges in end-to-end fact-checking.

Result: Key challenges include connecting claims to clinical trials, ambiguities in claims, and subjective veracity labels.

Conclusion: Fact-checking in medicine should be approached as an interactive communication problem, not an end-to-end process.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

### [7] [Optimising Language Models for Downstream Tasks: A Post-Training Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20917)
*Zhengyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve language model adaptation, including continued pre-training, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and enhanced supervised fine-tuning, along with new evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for language models underutilize unlabelled data, overfit on small datasets, and are computationally expensive, limiting their real-world application.

Method: The thesis introduces continued pre-training for unlabelled data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, improved supervised fine-tuning, and new evaluation benchmarks.

Result: The methods enhance LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization across diverse NLP tasks.

Conclusion: These advances improve LM adaptability, contributing to more robust and efficient models and progress toward artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

### [8] [FineWeb2: One Pipeline to Scale Them All -- Adapting Pre-Training Data Processing to Every Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20920)
*Guilherme Penedo,Hynek Kydlíček,Vinko Sabolčec,Bettina Messmer,Negar Foroutan,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Colin Raffel,Martin Jaggi,Leandro Von Werra,Thomas Wolf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new multilingual pre-training dataset pipeline, FineWeb2, is introduced to improve LLM performance by automating filtering and deduplication for diverse languages, scaling to 1000+ languages and releasing a 20TB dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of training multilingual LLMs due to difficulties in adapting data pipelines for multiple languages motivates the creation of a more adaptable and scalable solution.

Method: The pipeline is based on FineWeb, automatically adaptable to any language, and includes a novel evaluation task selection process and a rebalancing approach considering duplication and quality.

Result: The pipeline produces non-English corpora that outperform prior datasets, and FineWeb2, a 20TB multilingual dataset, is released.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates an effective, scalable solution for multilingual LLM pre-training, with publicly available resources to support further research.

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

*Xinping Zhao,Xinshuo Hu,Zifei Shan,Shouzheng Huang,Yao Zhou,Zetian Sun,Zhenyu Liu,Dongfang Li,Xinyuan Wei,Qian Chen,Youcheng Pan,Yang Xiang,Meishan Zhang,Haofen Wang,Jun Yu,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KaLM-Embedding-V2 is a compact embedding model with superior performance, leveraging bidirectional transformers, multi-stage training, and innovative techniques like focal-style reweighting and hard-negative mixing. It outperforms larger models on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile and compact embedding model that achieves high performance in general-purpose text embedding tasks by improving training techniques and data quality.

Method: 1. Uses a bidirectional transformer with mean-pooling for fixed-length embeddings. 2. Multi-stage training: pre-training, fine-tuning, and model-soup averaging. 3. Introduces focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing. 4. Utilizes diverse datasets (20+ categories for pre-training, 100+ for fine-tuning).

Result: Outperforms comparable models and competes with much larger ones (3x-26x size) on MTEB benchmarks, setting a new standard for compact models (<1B parameters).

Conclusion: KaLM-Embedding-V2 demonstrates that compact models can achieve state-of-the-art performance with innovative training and data strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

### [10] [Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20989)
*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether fine-tuning can emulate prompting in language models, proposing a meta-training method where gradient updates mimic prompting effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the effectiveness of prompting and the storage efficiency of fine-tuning, enabling models to generalize like prompted ones.

Method: Meta-training LMs using gradient-based meta-learning, using the LM's own prompted predictions as targets instead of ground-truth labels.

Result: Fine-tuning recovers some or all prompted performance, improving on tasks like the 'reversal curse' and answering questions after one gradient update.

Conclusion: Gradient descent can be expressive with proper initialization, opening new avenues for long-context modeling and understanding gradient-based learning.

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

### [11] [SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs with Dynamic Intensity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20993)
*Adithya Chittem,Aishna Shrivastava,Sai Tarun Pendela,Jagat Sesh Challa,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to include the 16PF model for finer personality control in LLMs, introduces SAC for trait intensity evaluation, and shows improved consistency and controllability in personality expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM personality models rely on the coarse Big Five framework and lack mechanisms for controlling trait intensity, limiting their expressiveness and human-like interaction capabilities.

Method: The authors extend MPI with the 16PF model and develop SAC, a framework using adjective-based semantic anchoring and five intensity factors (Frequency, Depth, Threshold, Effort, Willingness) for dynamic trait control.

Result: Modelling trait intensity as a continuous spectrum improves consistency and controllability. Changes in trait intensity influence related traits coherently, indicating LLMs internalize multi-dimensional personality structures.

Conclusion: The work advances nuanced human-machine interactions, with applications in healthcare, education, and interviews, moving closer to human-like social machines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

*Jatin Gupta,Akhil Sharma,Saransh Singhania,Mohammad Adnan,Sakshi Deo,Ali Imam Abidi,Keshav Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CA-Ben, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning in the Indian context, testing six models with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o performing best. Challenges in numerical and legal tasks highlight areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well LLMs handle domain-specific financial knowledge, especially in the Indian financial context, where such evaluations are lacking.

Method: CA-Ben, a benchmark based on ICAI exam datasets, was used to test six LLMs (GPT-4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1 405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Microsoft Phi 4) with standardized protocols.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o performed best, excelling in conceptual and legal reasoning, but faced challenges in numerical computations and legal interpretations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have strengths and limitations; future improvements could involve hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented methods for better quantitative and legal performance.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

### [13] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF) is proposed to unify query classification tasks in e-commerce, addressing issues like insufficient query information and label dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce queries are short and lack context, leading to insufficient prior information. Existing methods rely on posterior click behavior, creating a vicious cycle, and lack a unified framework.

Method: SSUF includes knowledge-enhanced, label-enhanced, and structure-enhanced modules to improve query and label representations, using semi-supervised signals and label semantics.

Result: SSUF outperforms state-of-the-art models in offline and online A/B experiments.

Conclusion: SSUF provides a scalable, unified solution for query classification, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

### [14] [MT2-CSD: A New Dataset and Multi-Semantic Knowledge Fusion Method for Conversational Stance Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21053)
*Fuqiang Niu,Genan Dai,Yisha Lu,Jiayu Liao,Xiang Li,Hu Huang,Bowen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MT2-CSD, a large dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational stance detection, and proposes LLM-CRAN, a model leveraging LLMs for improved performance, which outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stance detection lacks datasets capturing real social media dynamics, limiting progress in conversational stance detection.

Method: The authors create MT2-CSD, a large annotated dataset, and propose LLM-CRAN, a model using LLMs for conversational understanding.

Result: LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms baseline models in conversational stance detection.

Conclusion: The study advances conversational stance detection with a robust dataset and model, demonstrating LLM-CRAN's superiority.

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

*Kang He,Yuzhe Ding. Haining Wang,Fei Li,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DALR improves multimodal sentence representation by addressing cross-modal misalignment and intra-modal divergence through consistency learning and ranking distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align images and text coarsely, leading to misalignment bias and semantic divergence, degrading representation quality.

Method: Proposes DALR with a consistency learning module for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and ranking distillation for intra-modal alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on STS and TR tasks.

Conclusion: DALR effectively enhances multimodal sentence representation by addressing alignment challenges.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComRAG is a retrieval-augmented generation framework for real-time industrial CQA, integrating static and dynamic knowledge with efficient memory, outperforming baselines in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize external knowledge and lack dynamic historical QA context or efficient memory for industrial deployment.

Method: ComRAG integrates static knowledge with dynamic historical QA pairs using a centroid-based memory mechanism for retrieval, generation, and storage.

Result: ComRAG achieves up to 25.9% improvement in vector similarity, reduces latency by 8.7%-23.3%, and lowers chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06%.

Conclusion: ComRAG effectively addresses challenges in industrial CQA by combining static and dynamic knowledge with efficient memory, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progtuning is a progressive fine-tuning framework for Transformer models, reducing updated parameters by 25% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiency in fine-tuning by reducing unnecessary parameter updates in Transformer blocks.

Method: Progressively reduces updated Transformer blocks based on contribution.

Result: Reduces parameters by ~25% with competitive performance and high adaptability.

Conclusion: Progtuning optimizes resource allocation and works well with parameter-efficient methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

### [18] [Compressed and Smooth Latent Space for Text Diffusion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21170)
*Viacheslav Meshchaninov,Egor Chimbulatov,Alexander Shabalin,Aleksandr Abramov,Dmitry Vetrov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cosmos introduces a compressed latent space for text generation using diffusion models, offering faster inference and better coherence compared to autoregressive and token-level diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are slow and struggle with global coherence, while diffusion models face challenges with high-dimensional token representations. Cosmos aims to address these limitations.

Method: Cosmos learns a compressed latent space via an autoencoder trained for token-level reconstruction and alignment with a pretrained language encoder, enabling efficient diffusion-based text generation.

Result: Cosmos compresses text representations by 8x, matches token-level diffusion models in quality, and surpasses baselines with longer latent sequences. It achieves faster inference (2x speedup) and competitive performance across tasks.

Conclusion: Cosmos provides a scalable, efficient alternative to autoregressive and diffusion models, improving speed and coherence in text generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

*Koji Inoue,Mikey Elmers,Yahui Fu,Zi Haur Pang,Divesh Lala,Keiko Ochi,Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel transformer-based model for turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems, dynamically controlled via textual prompts like 'faster' or 'calmer', improves accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems with intuitive, explicit control to adapt dynamically to conversational contexts.

Method: Extends a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model by incorporating textual prompt embeddings into channel-wise and cross-channel transformers, using synthetic prompts generated by an LLM.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy and dynamic adaptation of turn-taking timing behaviors based on textual prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively integrates textual prompts for dynamic control, demonstrating feasibility and improved performance in turn-taking prediction.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

### [21] [Enhancing Automatic Term Extraction with Large Language Models via Syntactic Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21222)
*Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Dongjun Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a retrieval-based prompting strategy for Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) using syntactic similarity in few-shot settings, improving performance over semantic similarity methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have not been thoroughly explored for ATE, despite their success in other NLP tasks. The study aims to leverage syntactic cues for better term extraction.

Method: A retrieval-based prompting strategy selects demonstrations based on syntactic similarity, which is domain-agnostic and aids in capturing term boundaries. Evaluated in in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Result: Experiments on three ATE benchmarks show syntactic retrieval improves F1-score, emphasizing the role of syntactic cues in term extraction.

Conclusion: Syntactic retrieval is more effective than semantic methods for ATE, highlighting the importance of syntactic guidance when adapting LLMs to terminology tasks.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

*Tianyi Men,Zhuoran Jin,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark called Agent-RewardBench is proposed to evaluate reward modeling in MLLMs, addressing challenges in self-correction and generalization for multimodal agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal agents lack external feedback for self-correction and generalization, necessitating a standardized way to evaluate reward models.

Method: Agent-RewardBench evaluates reward models across multiple dimensions (perception, planning, safety) in 7 real-world scenarios, with step-level granularity and controlled difficulty.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs perform poorly on the benchmark, indicating a need for specialized training in reward modeling.

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench fills a critical gap in evaluating reward models for multimodal agents, highlighting the need for further research and development in this area.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at
github.

*Andrea McGlinchey,Peter J Barclay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether increasingly large language models (LLMs) can outpace simple classifiers in generating deceptive text, focusing on classical detective fiction. Results show mixed progress, suggesting detection may remain feasible despite model growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' ability to generate undetectable fake text will plateau, given the increasing resources required for larger models and the effectiveness of simple classifiers.

Method: Statistical classifiers were used to detect artificially generated text in classical detective fiction, comparing performance across model versions (e.g., Gemini and GPT).

Result: Gemini showed improved deceptive text generation over a 0.5 version increase, while GPT did not, indicating detection may remain viable for larger models.

Conclusion: Reliable detection of fake text may persist even as models grow, though new architectures could enhance deceptiveness.

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

TL;DR: Double-Checker enhances slow-thinking LLMs by enabling iterative self-critique and refinement, improving reasoning performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of LLMs in generating informative critiques and refining solutions, aiming to enhance their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces Double-Checker, a framework for iterative self-critique and refinement, fine-tuned on 1,730 self-critical instances.

Result: Improves pass@1 performance on AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2%, showcasing enhanced reasoning.

Conclusion: Double-Checker presents a promising approach for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs with structured self-critique.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lightweight encoder models like RoBERTa and NomicBERT can detect groundedness in queries as effectively as large LLMs, reducing latency and resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve LLM reliability by ensuring responses are strictly supported by provided context, avoiding ungrounded speculation.

Method: Fine-tune task-specific encoder models (RoBERTa, NomicBERT) on curated datasets for groundedness detection.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3 8B, GPT4o) with significantly lower inference latency.

Conclusion: Lightweight models offer efficient groundedness detection, enhancing LLM trustworthiness and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: A text-only autoregressive language model is used to extract referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue, showing effectiveness despite inherent multimodal limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if linguistic context alone can detect mentions with visual referents in dialogue.

Method: Adapt a pretrained LLM for course-grained mention span annotation via next-token prediction.

Result: Text-only approach is effective with small datasets and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, emphasizing linguistic context.

Conclusion: The task is inherently multimodal; unimodal approaches have fundamental limitations.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

TL;DR: GLASS enhances LLMs' literary analysis using Greimas Semiotic Square, outperforming experts and producing high-quality critiques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack depth in professional literary criticism; GLASS aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes GLASS framework, a dataset for GSS-based criticism, and quantitative metrics using LLM-as-a-judge.

Result: GLASS shows high performance compared to expert criticism and generates original analyses for classic works.

Conclusion: GLASS provides an AI tool for literary research, addressing gaps and offering cognitive insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

TL;DR: Omni-RAG is a framework to enhance RAG systems for noisy, ambiguous, and multi-intent queries using LLM-assisted preprocessing, intent-aware retrieval, and reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with noisy and complex real-world queries, often trained on cleaner data. Omni-RAG aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses three modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, and (3) Reranking and Generation with LLMs like Falcon-10B.

Result: Improves robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings.

Conclusion: Omni-RAG addresses real-world challenges, aligning with demands like the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A DK-Enhanced LLM framework improves fraud and concept drift detection by integrating domain knowledge with LLMs, achieving high accuracy in classifying deceptive conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evolving language patterns and concept drift make detecting deceptive conversations challenging, especially with LLMs struggling in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The framework combines pretrained LLMs with domain knowledge, featuring modules for fake conversation detection, drift detection, and drift classification.

Result: The system achieves 98% accuracy in classifying fake conversations and effectively identifies drift types.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness enhances LLM performance, interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundational LLMs on Text2Cypher tasks across English, Spanish, and Turkish, revealing performance disparities due to training data and linguistic differences. Prompt translation has minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multilingual evaluation in Text2Cypher tasks and assess LLM performance across languages.

Method: Created a multilingual test set by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish, preserving Cypher queries. Evaluated models using standardized prompts and metrics.

Result: Performance was highest in English, followed by Spanish, and lowest in Turkish, attributed to training data and linguistic differences. Prompt translation had little effect.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for inclusive multilingual evaluation and development, suggesting future work like schema localization and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns preferences for spoken dialogue models using real-time user interactions, leveraging a large-scale dataset and offline alignment to improve factual accuracy, safety, and contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods are text-based and inadequate for real-time speech interactions, which involve richer dynamics like interruptions and lack explicit turn segmentation.

Method: A large-scale dataset of 150,000 preference pairs from multi-turn speech conversations is created, annotated with AI feedback. Offline alignment methods finetune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model.

Result: The framework improves spoken dialogue models, making interactions more factual, safer, and contextually aligned. Human evaluations confirm its effectiveness beyond single-turn conversations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for a calibrated balance among dynamics in real-time speech dialogue systems, validated by human evaluations.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [32] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopK LMs, a modified transformer architecture with TopK activation, to address shortcomings of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in interpretability and feature stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs have limitations in interpretability and feature stability, making it hard to trace concept learning in LMs. The paper aims to integrate interpretability directly into the model architecture.

Method: The authors modify the transformer architecture by incorporating a TopK activation function at selected layers, eliminating the need for post-hoc SAE training.

Result: TopK LMs maintain original capabilities while offering robust interpretability, enabling neuron interventions and detailed analysis of neuron formation.

Conclusion: TopK LMs provide a stable and reliable tool for understanding LM learning and representation, advancing research in interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large language models show strong performance in semi-online and fully online regimes, outperforming offline methods. Surprisingly, Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization perform similarly. Multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable rewards improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in transitioning from offline to online regimes for finetuning large language models, especially for verifiable and non-verifiable tasks.

Method: Experiments compare online and semi-online Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization, analyzing training dynamics and hyperparameter selection.

Result: Online and semi-online methods outperform offline, with similar performance between variants. Multi-tasking improves results across task types.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning in online/semi-online regimes is highly effective, with multi-tasking further enhancing performance for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

### [34] [Enhancing User Engagement in Socially-Driven Dialogue through Interactive LLM Alignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21497)
*Jiashuo Wang,Kaitao Song,Chunpu Xu,Changhe Song,Yang Xiao,Dongsheng Li,Lili Qiu,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance user engagement in socially-driven dialogues by aligning interactive LLMs with user reactions as rewards, using a user simulator and i×MCTS for interaction exploration, validated in emotional support and persuasion scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods focus on knowledge or dialogue acts but fail to guarantee user engagement in socially-driven dialogues, prompting the need for a direct engagement indicator.

Method: The approach uses a user simulator and i×MCTS to explore interactions, collects a dataset of high/low-quality experiences, and aligns LLMs via direct preference optimization (DPO).

Result: Experiments in emotional support and persuasion scenarios show the method effectively boosts user engagement in interactive LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances user engagement by leveraging direct user reaction signals and interaction exploration.

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

*Marina Mancoridis,Bec Weeks,Keyon Vafa,Sendhil Mullainathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the validity of benchmark evaluations for LLMs, arguing they may only show 'potemkin understanding'—superficial success not aligned with human reasoning. It introduces methods to detect such illusions and finds them widespread.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that benchmark success equates to genuine understanding in LLMs, highlighting potential misalignment with human reasoning.

Method: Introduces a formal framework and two procedures: one using a custom benchmark, the other a general method to quantify 'potemkin understanding.'

Result: Finds 'potemkins' are common across models, tasks, and domains, indicating deeper incoherence in concept representations.

Conclusion: Benchmark success may not reflect true understanding in LLMs, as their reasoning often diverges from human cognition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users interact with LLMs for healthcare information and identify inherent risks, such as incomplete context or sycophancy, in these conversations.

Method: Curated HealthChat-11K dataset from large-scale conversational AI data, analyzed using a clinician-driven taxonomy across 21 health specialties.

Result: Revealed insights into user behaviors, including common interactions, incomplete context, affective behaviors, and sycophancy-inducing questions.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improving LLMs' healthcare support capabilities to address identified risks and enhance user interactions.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Efficacy (DELT), a paradigm optimizing data organization in LM training, featuring components like Data Scoring (LQS) and Data Ordering (FO), validated by experiments showing performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexamined area of data organization (Data Efficacy) in LM training, complementing data efficiency efforts.

Method: Proposes DELT with three components: Data Scoring (LQS), Data Selection, and Data Ordering (FO). LQS scores data by learnability and quality, while FO addresses forgetting and bias.

Result: DELT improves LM performance without increasing data or model size. LQS and FO combined yield the most significant gains. Data efficacy can coexist with efficiency.

Conclusion: Data efficacy is a promising foundational area for LM training, enhancing performance through optimized data organization.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

### [39] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv is a novel MIL framework using optimal transport to model pathological heterogeneity in WSIs, improving survival prediction with global and local constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity in WSIs, both globally (long-tailed distributions) and locally (tile-level uncertainty).

Method: OTSurv formulates survival prediction as an OT problem with global long-tail and local uncertainty-aware constraints, solved via an unbalanced OT formulation.

Result: OTSurv achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks, with a 3.6% average C-index improvement and statistical significance in log-rank tests.

Conclusion: OTSurv is a powerful, interpretable tool for survival prediction in digital pathology, addressing heterogeneity effectively.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

*Haodong Li,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoDiff combines stereo matching for static regions and video depth diffusion for dynamic regions to improve video depth estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video depth estimation differs from image depth estimation due to varying temporal consistency needs in static and dynamic regions.

Method: StereoDiff uses a two-stage approach: stereo matching for static areas and video depth diffusion for dynamic areas, leveraging their complementary strengths.

Result: StereoDiff outperforms existing methods in zero-shot, real-world benchmarks, offering superior consistency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The synergy of stereo matching and video depth diffusion effectively addresses the unique challenges of video depth estimation.

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

TL;DR: ConViTac is a visual-tactile representation learning network using contrastive embeddings to improve feature alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.0%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing feature integration in visual-tactile fusion for better perception and manipulation tasks, addressing limitations of direct combination methods.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) mechanism, using self-supervised contrastive learning to project inputs into unified latent embeddings and coupling fusion via cross-modal attention.

Result: Improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification and grasping prediction tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ConViTac effectively aligns visual-tactile features, demonstrating superior performance in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates promptable models (SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D) and nnU-Net on medical image segmentation, highlighting SAM/SAM 2's high Dice scores with accurate prompts but nnU-Net's dominance due to practical limitations. Fine-tuning improves point prompts but not beyond bounding boxes or nnU-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation and comparison of promptable models in medical image segmentation across varied prompt qualities on a common dataset.

Method: Zero-shot inference and fine-tuning of SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net on BraTS 2023 datasets using points and bounding box prompts.

Result: SAM/SAM 2 achieved high Dice scores (up to 0.894/0.893) with accurate prompts, but nnU-Net remained dominant. Fine-tuning improved point prompts but not beyond bounding boxes or nnU-Net.

Conclusion: Accurate prompts enhance SAM/SAM 2 performance, but nnU-Net is more practical. Fine-tuning shows promise but doesn't surpass bounding boxes or nnU-Net.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA, Gemini Flash 2.0, and HD-GCN. HD-GCN performs best, but V-JEPA shows promise for reducing system complexity. Gemini struggles with zero-shot gesture recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the generalization abilities of VFMs and VLMs for simplifying gesture recognition systems in noisy, agile production environments.

Method: Comparative evaluation of V-JEPA (VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (VLM), and HD-GCN (skeleton-based) on the NUGGET dataset for gesture recognition.

Result: HD-GCN achieves the best performance, while V-JEPA comes close with a simple classification head. Gemini struggles in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: VFMs like V-JEPA offer potential for reducing system complexity, but further research is needed for VLMs like Gemini to improve gesture recognition.

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [44] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using vision-language models (VLMs) to select the most trustworthy super-resolution (SR) image from diffusion-generated sets, validated by a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between fidelity and perceptual quality in SR, and the challenge of selecting reliable solutions from diverse diffusion outputs.

Method: Leverages VLMs (e.g., BLIP-2, GPT-4o) to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifacts, then ensembles top-ranked candidates. Introduces TWS, a hybrid metric combining CLIP embeddings, SSIM on edge maps, and wavelet decomposition.

Result: TWS correlates strongly with human preference, and VLM-guided selections yield high TWS values, outperforming conventional metrics like PSNR and LPIPS.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, generalizable solution for trustworthy SR, aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [45] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixCLR introduces a method for semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) by adapting contrastive learning to ensure domain-invariant representations, improving performance when combined with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity in SSDG leads to underperformance of domain generalization methods, requiring explicit regularization for domain-invariant learning.

Method: FixCLR adapts contrastive learning by using pseudo-labels for class information and a repelling term, ensuring domain invariance.

Result: FixCLR enhances SSDG performance, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods, as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FixCLR is an effective SSDG method, addressing domain invariance and improving performance in label-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [46] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COVER reformulates contrastive learning as a vector regression problem to preserve pixel-wise feature correlations in self-supervised pretraining, outperforming binary CL in medical vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard contrastive learning (binary CL) disrupts pixel-wise feature correlations due to over-dispersion, limiting its effectiveness in medical vision.

Method: Proposes COVER, a framework using vector regression to quantify dispersion and preserve feature correlations via a vector pyramid architecture.

Result: COVER significantly improves pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining across 8 tasks, 2 dimensions, and 4 modalities.

Conclusion: COVER advances generalizable medical visual foundation models by addressing the limitations of binary CL in pixel-wise representation.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAS is a data augmentation method for dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) that uses soft labels to improve performance on ambiguous expressions. It combines video frames and labels convexly, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguous facial expressions in real-world data challenge accurate DFER. MIDAS aims to enhance recognition by leveraging soft labels for better ambiguity handling.

Method: MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining video frames and their soft labels, extending mixup to video data.

Result: Experiments on DFEW and FERV39k-Plus show MIDAS-trained models outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MIDAS effectively improves DFER performance for ambiguous expressions, demonstrating its practical utility.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [48] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThirdEye introduces a cue-aware pipeline for monocular depth estimation, leveraging explicit visual cues like occlusion boundaries and shading, fused hierarchically with a working-memory module for reliability-weighted results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods implicitly learn depth from RGB pixels, ignoring explicit cues humans use. ThirdEye aims to incorporate these cues deliberately for better depth estimation.

Method: Uses pre-trained, frozen networks to supply cues (e.g., occlusion, shading), fused hierarchically (V1->V2->V3) with a working-memory module. An adaptive-bins transformer head produces high-resolution disparity maps.

Result: ThirdEye leverages external supervision from frozen cue experts, requiring only modest fine-tuning. Detailed results will be provided in a future revision.

Conclusion: ThirdEye improves monocular depth estimation by explicitly integrating human-like visual cues, reducing reliance on implicit learning.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiHuman-Testbench, a benchmark for evaluating generative models in multi-human image generation, addressing challenges like facial identity preservation and action complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a dedicated benchmark for multi-human image generation, especially for complex actions and identity preservation, motivates the creation of MultiHuman-Testbench.

Method: The benchmark includes 1800 samples with curated text prompts and 5,550 unique human face images, along with pose conditioning images. It uses four metrics for evaluation and proposes techniques like human segmentation and Hungarian matching.

Result: The benchmark evaluates diverse models, showing improvements in ID similarity with novel techniques.

Conclusion: MultiHuman-Testbench provides standardized insights and tools for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve depth reconstruction in stereo vision by integrating geometric priors and human-inspired perception.

Method: Revisits the Cyclopean Eye model, introduces novel geometric constraints, and evaluates deep learning-based stereo feature matching and attention mechanisms.

Result: Combining geometric priors with learned features enhances understanding and accuracy of stereo vision systems.

Conclusion: Strong geometric priors and learned features together provide better abstractions for stereo vision systems.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model
and propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth
discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

*Advait Gupta,Rishie Raj,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaSTA$^*$, a neurosymbolic agent combining LLM planning and A$^*$ search for cost-efficient multi-turn image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complex multi-turn image editing tasks efficiently by balancing fast planning with accurate tool-use.

Method: Combines LLM subtask planning with A$^*$ search, reuses successful subroutines, and adaptively triggers slow search for novel tasks.

Result: FaSTA$^*$ is computationally efficient and competitive in success rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$ offers a scalable and efficient solution for multi-turn image editing by leveraging reusable subroutines and adaptive planning.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2SFormer is a Transformer-based framework for image forgery localization, combining multi-frequency and multi-scale attention with a global prior map to improve accuracy and preserve fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for forgery localization face challenges like computational overhead and limited representation power, especially for subtle or complex tampering.

Method: M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in skip connections and uses a global prior map with a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve fine details.

Result: M2SFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, showing superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses existing limitations, offering improved performance in forgery localization.

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

TL;DR: PhysRig is a physics-based skinning and rigging framework that addresses LBS limitations by simulating deformable soft-body structures, outperforming traditional methods in realism and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) causes artifacts like volume loss and unnatural deformations, failing to model elastic materials. PhysRig aims to overcome these issues.

Method: Embeds a rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation, simulated as a deformable soft-body. Uses continuum mechanics and material prototypes for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms LBS-based methods, producing realistic and physically plausible results. Validated on a diverse synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: PhysRig offers a versatile and superior alternative to LBS for articulated object modeling, demonstrated in pose transfer tasks.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for aviation visibility estimation are limited, prompting the creation of a comprehensive dataset.

Method: A year-long data collection campaign from the FAA weather camera network, followed by benchmarking three common approaches.

Result: The new dataset and benchmarks provide a foundation for visibility estimation in aviation weather.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmarks fill a gap in aviation weather research, offering a low-cost alternative to traditional sensors.

Abstract: Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for
providing low-cost alternatives for traditional, expensive weather sensors;
however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available
datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation,
of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are
absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of
a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera
network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying
three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and
tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when
compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HST-CSLR proposes a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree to align visual and textual modalities in continuous sign language recognition, leveraging gloss knowledge and reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large datasets and precise annotations in CSLR limits performance, and existing methods underutilize gloss knowledge.

Method: Constructs a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST) to align visual and textual modalities step-by-step, using gloss-specific knowledge from large language models and contrastive alignment enhancement.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture).

Conclusion: HST-CSLR efficiently combines gloss knowledge with visual representation learning, improving CSLR performance.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

distinctive features: (i) Full-modal collaboration: We design evaluation tasks
that highlight the strong coupling between audio and video, requiring models to
effectively leverage the collaborative perception of all modalities; (ii)
Diversity of videos: OmniEval includes 810 audio-visual synchronized videos,
285 Chinese videos and 525 English videos; (iii) Diversity and granularity of
tasks: OmniEval contains 2617 question-answer pairs, comprising 1412 open-ended
questions and 1205 multiple-choice questions. These questions are divided into
3 major task types and 12 sub-task types to achieve comprehensive evaluation.
Among them, we introduce a more granular video localization task named
Grounding. Then we conduct experiments on OmniEval with several omni-modality

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology models lack integration of natural language and multi-image understanding, and autonomous diagnostic reasoning. PathChat+ addresses these gaps.

Method: Developed PathChat+ with 1M+ pathology-specific instruction samples and 5.5M QA turns. Combined with SlideSeek for hierarchical reasoning on WSIs.

Result: PathChat+ outperforms prior models and general-purpose MLLMs. SlideSeek achieves high accuracy on DDxBench and generates interpretable reports.

Conclusion: PathChat+ and SlideSeek advance computational pathology by enabling autonomous, context-aware diagnostic reasoning and reporting.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods for Video DiTs incur high computational costs due to attention modification or fine-tuning.

Method: DFVEdit operates on clean latents via flow transformation, unifying editing and sampling under a continuous flow perspective. It introduces Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) and integrates Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) and Embedding Reinforcement (ER) for enhanced quality.

Result: DFVEdit achieves 20x inference speed-up, 85% memory reduction, and state-of-the-art performance in structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.

Conclusion: DFVEdit is a highly efficient and effective solution for video editing in Video DiTs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cradle2Cane is a two-pass face aging framework using diffusion models to balance age accuracy and identity preservation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face aging methods struggle with the Age-ID trade-off, either sacrificing identity for age accuracy or vice versa.

Method: Proposes a two-pass framework: first pass uses adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) for age accuracy; second pass uses identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb) for identity preservation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on CelebA-HQ, achieving better age accuracy and identity consistency.

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane effectively balances age transformation and identity preservation, setting a new benchmark in face aging.

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

*Weichen Dai,Kangcheng Ma,Jiaxin Wang,Kecen Pan,Yuhang Ming,Hua Zhang,Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D scene-camera representation method with joint photometric optimization improves scene representation by accounting for camera distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric distortions in camera imaging degrade image quality, leading to erroneous 3D scene representations. Addressing these distortions is crucial for accurate reconstructions.

Method: The method introduces internal and external photometric models, optimizes camera parameters, and uses depth regularization to separate scene-unrelated information.

Result: High-quality 3D scene representations are achieved even under imaging degradation like vignetting and dirt.

Conclusion: The proposed joint optimization effectively enhances scene representation by mitigating photometric distortions.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose) pose editing difficulties and inconsistencies with text prompts, prompting a revisit to sparse signals for their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature.

Method: SP-Ctrl extends OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation and introduces keypoint concept learning to improve pose alignment.

Result: SP-Ctrl outperforms dense signal-based methods in pose-guided image generation and shows promise in diverse and cross-species generation.

Conclusion: Sparse signals, enhanced by SP-Ctrl, are a viable alternative to dense signals for pose-guided text-to-image generation, offering simplicity and robustness.

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

*Xiao Zhang,Yongqiang Ma,Haodong Jing,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVA, a Mixture-of-Experts framework, improves CZSL by addressing suboptimal primitive feature derivation and cross-modal matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods lack fine-grained alignment and optimal primitive representation due to simplistic composition-prototype mapping and all-to-one matching.

Method: Proposes EVA with domain-expert adaption for token-aware learning and semantic variant alignment for precise image-primitives matching.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three benchmarks in closed- and open-world settings.

Conclusion: EVA's approach enhances compositional generalization, demonstrating its efficacy in CZSL.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

TL;DR: PathSegmentor is a text-prompted segmentation foundation model for pathology images, leveraging the PathSeg dataset, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in pathology image segmentation due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions.

Method: Proposes PathSegmentor, a text-prompted model, and introduces PathSeg, a large dataset with 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 categories.

Result: PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models, surpassing them by 0.145 and 0.429 in Dice scores, and enhances interpretability for clinical use.

Conclusion: Advances explainable AI in precision oncology by improving segmentation accuracy and clinical decision-making support.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSDASeg, a two-stage model with direct cross-modal alignment and memory modules, improves interactive point cloud segmentation by aligning 3D point clouds with textual/2D data and leveraging dynamic memory banks for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with point-level tasks like segmentation due to poor 3D-text alignment, limiting local 3D feature linking with textual context.

Method: Proposes TSDASeg with a direct cross-modal alignment module and memory banks for storing and dynamically updating text, visual, and cross-modal features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: TSDASeg effectively addresses inconsistencies in interactive segmentation by aligning 3D and textual data and leveraging memory modules.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively capture all sound events in a video, mirroring traditional Foley workflows.

Method: Step-by-step generation of audio tracks, guided by text prompts and prior audio, using pre-trained models without specialized datasets.

Result: Generates multiple distinct audio tracks per video, outperforming baselines in composite audio quality.

Conclusion: The method enables high-quality, semantically rich audio synthesis from videos without requiring specialized training data.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DBMovi-GS for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular videos, addressing challenges in real-world dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in dynamic, blurry scenes due to reliance on static assumptions.

Method: Uses sparse-controlled Gaussian splatting to restore sharpness and reconstruct 3D geometry from blurry videos.

Result: Achieves robust performance and sets a new benchmark for blurry monocular video synthesis.

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS effectively addresses dynamic view synthesis in challenging blurry conditions.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAIC, a style-aligned image composition method to enhance abnormal cell detection in cytopathology by generating high-fidelity synthetic images without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like poor annotations, long-tailed data, and inconsistent staining styles hinder robust training of neural networks for abnormal cell detection.

Method: SAIC selects candidates from an abnormal cell bank, uses high-frequency feature reconstruction for style-aligned composition, and filters images with a vision-language model.

Result: SAIC improves detection performance and robustness, especially for tail categories and styles, validated by comprehensive quality evaluation.

Conclusion: SAIC is practical for clinical applications, with code available for public use.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inverse Scene Text Removal (ISTR), focusing on detecting STR-processed images and localizing removed text regions, with high accuracy. It also explores recovering removed text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misuse risks of STR by enabling detection of processed images and improving STR methods.

Method: ISTR involves binary classification (detecting STR-processed images) and localizing removed text regions. A text recognizer is trained to attempt text recovery.

Result: High accuracy in detecting STR-processed images and localizing removed text. Recovery of removed text is challenging.

Conclusion: ISTR effectively detects STR misuse and improves STR, though text recovery remains difficult.

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionGuard is a multi-stage framework for detecting helmet violations in motorcyclists, improving classification consistency and recall for underrepresented classes, achieving a 3.1% mAP boost over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Helmet regulation enforcement is critical for road safety, but automatic detection is hindered by environmental variability, camera angles, and data inconsistencies.

Method: VisionGuard combines Adaptive Labeling (tracking-based refinement for consistent classification) and Contextual Expander (virtual bounding boxes for underrepresented classes).

Result: VisionGuard improves mAP by 3.1% over baseline detectors, proving effective for real-world traffic surveillance.

Conclusion: VisionGuard enhances helmet violation detection, promoting safety and regulatory compliance in traffic systems.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework combining SAM and FFCL improves accuracy and speed in assessing breast cancer tumor margins during lumpectomy, reducing re-excision rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D specimen radiography (SR) lacks accuracy, leading to high re-excision rates. A better method is needed to improve surgical outcomes.

Method: Combines Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL) for patch-level classification and refined tumor margin segmentation.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and 27.4% Dice improvement, with inference time of 47ms per image.

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM enhances margin assessment accuracy and speed, potentially reducing re-excision rates in breast cancer surgery.

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods model aging as a single deterministic path, lacking diversity and control. This work aims to visualize multiple plausible futures by accounting for external factors.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion-based approach with attention mixing for editing strength and Simulated Aging Regularization for stability.

Result: Outperforms existing models in identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment, validated by experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: The framework transforms aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable process, enabling applications in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

TL;DR: Proposes a less invasive AR method for novel view synthesis using locally reconstructed light fields and error visualization, reducing mental demand and expanding capture areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR methods for view synthesis are mentally demanding and restrict capture areas due to 3D annotations and sampling theory limitations.

Method: Uses locally reconstructed light fields and visualizes errors to guide new view insertion, avoiding 3D annotations.

Result: Error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment, and requires fewer view samples. Also aids radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes.

Conclusion: The approach improves user experience and scalability in AR-based view synthesis, supporting broader scene exploration.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

### [73] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) to automate video quality assessment (VQA) instruction data creation, eliminating reliance on human annotations and proprietary systems. It produces a large dataset (Score2Instruct) and a benchmark (S2I-Bench) to enhance video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VQA methods provide numerical scores but lack detailed quality descriptions, limiting their utility. The paper aims to leverage video LMMs for richer, language-based quality assessments.

Method: The SIG pipeline scores unlabeled videos, maps scores to text-defined levels, and uses hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model quality correlations. It generates the S2I dataset (320K instruction pairs) and employs progressive tuning for video LMMs.

Result: The method improves video LMMs' quality scoring and justification capabilities, validated on S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: SIG automates instruction data generation, enhancing video LMMs for VQA with scalable, efficient, and detailed quality assessments.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

*Huan Wang,Haoran Li,Huaming Chen,Jun Yan,Jiahua Shi,Jun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedSC addresses data heterogeneity in federated learning by leveraging semantic-aware collaboration through relational and consistent prototypes, improving model performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning leads to biased labeling preferences, which existing methods often overlook by neglecting intra-client semantic information.

Method: FedSC constructs relational and consistent prototypes at a semantic level, using inter-contrastive learning and discrepancy aggregation to optimize local models.

Result: Experiments show FedSC's effectiveness in handling data heterogeneity and improving model performance across challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: FedSC successfully integrates semantic knowledge to tackle data heterogeneity, offering a robust and efficient solution for federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

*Qingyue Jiao,Kangyu Zheng,Yiyu Shi,Zhiding Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A classical-quantum GAN is introduced for generating color medical images, outperforming classical and hybrid GANs in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of classical generative models (high resource demands) and quantum methods (low-quality grayscale outputs) in skin disease data augmentation.

Method: A novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique to create a hybrid GAN for generating color medical images.

Result: The model surpasses classical and hybrid GANs in image quality and classification performance, with significantly fewer parameters and training epochs.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of quantum image generation, especially as quantum hardware improves, and shows robust performance on real quantum machines.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

### [76] [Multimodal Prompt Alignment for Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21017)
*Fuyan Ma,Yiran He,Bin Sun,Shutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPA-FER improves facial expression recognition by aligning multimodal prompts with fine-grained textual-visual relationships, leveraging LLM-generated descriptions and prototype-guided alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based FER methods fail to capture subtle textual-visual relationships needed for distinguishing facial expressions.

Method: Proposes MPA-FER, using LLM-generated hard prompts, prototype-guided alignment, and cross-modal global-local alignment to refine visual-textual relationships.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmarks while maintaining pretrained model benefits and low computational costs.

Conclusion: MPA-FER effectively enhances FER by integrating fine-grained semantic guidance and preserving model generalization.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

*Lei Hao,Lina Xu,Chang Liu,Yanni Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LASFNet, a lightweight attention-guided feature fusion network for multimodal object detection, simplifying training and improving efficiency-accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses computational overhead and complexity in existing multimodal feature fusion methods.

Method: Introduces a single feature-level fusion unit, ASFF module for adaptive feature response, and FATM for enhanced feature focus.

Result: Reduces parameters by 90%, computational cost by 85%, and improves mAP by 1%-3%.

Conclusion: LASFNet offers a simpler, more efficient solution for multimodal object detection with competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

TL;DR: The paper introduces 1D binary image latents for compact discrete image representation, achieving competitive performance in text-to-image models with fewer tokens and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational demands and improve efficiency in high-resolution image modeling by advancing compact discrete image representation.

Method: Introduces 1D binary image latents, representing images as binary vectors instead of traditional one-hot codebook tokens, and uses simple model architectures.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in diffusion and auto-regressive generation with 128 tokens for 1024x1024 images, reducing tokens by 32x compared to VQ-VAEs, and improves training/inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable, efficient alternative to conventional tokenization, achieving high performance without private data or post-training refinements.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

TL;DR: DidSee is a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects, addressing biases and feature limitations with a rescaled noise scheduler, noise-agnostic training, and semantic enhancer, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial RGB-D cameras produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects, and traditional methods struggle with generalization due to limited training data diversity.

Method: DidSee integrates a rescaled noise scheduler, noise-agnostic single-step training, and a semantic enhancer for joint depth completion and segmentation.

Result: DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, robust real-world generalization, and improves downstream tasks like pose estimation and robotic grasping.

Conclusion: DidSee effectively addresses biases and feature limitations in depth completion for non-Lambertian objects, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

*Boyong He,Yuxiang Ji,Zhuoyue Tan,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve domain generalization and adaptation in detectors by leveraging intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, reducing inference time by 75% while enhancing performance. It introduces an object-centered auxiliary branch and consistency loss for robust, domain-invariant features, achieving competitive results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detectors often underperform due to domain gaps between training and testing data. Existing methods using diffusion models struggle with high inference costs and underutilization of diffusion capabilities.

Method: Extracts intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, introduces an object-centered auxiliary branch with box-masked images and class prompts, and applies consistency loss for alignment. Also aligns standard detectors with diffusion detectors for cross-domain performance.

Result: Achieves competitive results on 3 DA and 5 DG benchmarks, with significant efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the superiority of diffusion models in domain-generalized and adaptive detection tasks, offering insights for diverse visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

*Hansam Cho,Seoung Bum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FGS (Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling) to balance editability and faithfulness in text-guided diffusion models for image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a trade-off between editability (extent of modification) and faithfulness (preservation of unaltered elements) in image editing using diffusion models.

Method: FGS introduces faithfulness guidance to preserve input image details and a scheduling strategy to align editability and faithfulness.

Result: FGS improves faithfulness without compromising editability and works well with various editing methods.

Conclusion: FGS enables precise, high-quality image edits by effectively balancing editability and faithfulness.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance adversarial transferability by leveraging self-supervised ViT representations, inspired by their synergy with Transformers.

Method: Proposes dSVA, a generative framework combining contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modeling (MIM) features, utilizing a generator and attention mechanisms.

Result: CL and MIM features, when exploited together, significantly improve adversarial transferability across various model architectures.

Conclusion: dSVA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by disrupting dual self-supervised ViT features, achieving remarkable black-box transferability.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal reasoning models, proposing a method using reinforcement learning and context rewards to improve global context understanding and avoid shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multimodal reasoning in LLMs by addressing insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with context, format, accuracy, and logical rewards judged by an LLM, and introduces the IntentBench benchmark.

Result: Demonstrates advanced performance on omni-modal benchmarks compared to other models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves multimodal reasoning by leveraging global context and logical integration.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching' (RoI-Matching), a flexible task for matching customized document regions. It proposes RoI-Matcher, a siamese network-based framework, and benchmarks it on RoI-Matching-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document analysis solutions lack flexibility for user-customized applications, prompting the need for a more adaptable method.

Method: The RoI-Matcher framework uses a siamese network for multi-level feature extraction and cross-attention layers for semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RoI-Matcher on the RoI-Matching-Bench, establishing it as a baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The proposed RoI-Matching task and RoI-Matcher framework offer a flexible, efficient solution for document analysis, with potential for further advancements.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: SAMURAI combines CLIP-based semantic matching and shape-guided re-ranking for 3D object retrieval from masked 2D images and language descriptions, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in retrieving 3D objects from masked 2D images and language prompts due to distorted viewpoints, ambiguous descriptions, and noisy masks.

Method: Integrates CLIP-based semantic matching, shape-guided re-ranking using binary silhouettes, and a majority voting strategy. Includes preprocessing for mask enhancement.

Result: Competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set.

Conclusion: Combining shape priors with language understanding is crucial for robust 3D object retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseMaster is an end-to-end framework for 3D character generation, unifying pose transformation and 3D reconstruction to address distortion and degradation issues in existing methods. It uses 3D body bones for pose control and improves generalizability through conditional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based methods for 3D character modeling suffer from distortion and degraded images due to self-occlusion and viewpoints, affecting reconstruction quality.

Method: PoseMaster integrates pose transformation and 3D generation into a flow-based framework, using 3D body bones as pose conditions and employing conditional training with randomly emptied conditions. A high-quality dataset is created for implicit skeleton-skinning relationships.

Result: PoseMaster outperforms state-of-the-art methods in A-pose character generation and demonstrates precise arbitrary-pose control.

Conclusion: PoseMaster effectively addresses distortion and degradation issues, offering superior performance and control in 3D character generation.

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

Conclusion: EgoAdapt offers a scalable solution for efficient egocentric perception without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different
egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active
speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.

EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to improve real-time stereo matching by mitigating information loss in small-scale cost volumes, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time stereo matching with high accuracy is challenging due to redundant information in large-scale cost volumes or insufficient data in small-scale ones.

Method: ESM integrates primary features into disparity upsampling, extracts and fuses features, and refines them using a compact hourglass network.

Result: ESMStereo achieves 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on AGX Orin, with accurate disparity maps.

Conclusion: ESM effectively balances accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time autonomous systems.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The undeciphered Oracle Bone Script characters pose challenges due to their complexity and abstract imagery, requiring innovative methods for interpretation.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) MLLM with SAR for glyph analysis and visual localization, 2) OSVF for generating semantically enriched vector fonts with structural constraints.

Result: OracleFusion outperforms baseline models in semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, aiding experts in decipherment.

Conclusion: OracleFusion is a valuable tool for advancing OBS decipherment, offering expert-like insights and enhanced readability.

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

### [92] [IPFormer-VideoLLM: Enhancing Multi-modal Video Understanding for Multi-shot Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21116)
*Yujia Liang,Jile Jiao,Zhicheng Wang,Xuetao Feng,Zixuan Ye,Yuan Wang,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios due to lack of annotated data. A new dataset (MultiClip-Bench) and model (IPFormer-VideoLLM) are introduced to address this, improving multi-shot understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs fail in multi-shot scenarios (e.g., varying camera angles), leading to issues like identity forgetting. The lack of multi-shot annotations in datasets is identified as a key challenge.

Method: A new dataset (MultiClip-Bench) with dense descriptions and QA pairs is introduced. A model (IPFormer-VideoLLM) injects instance-level features via an attention-based connector to aggregate identity information across scenes.

Result: The dataset boosts multi-shot performance, and the model enhances understanding by preserving instance identity. Both show advantages in video benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model significantly improve multi-shot video understanding and perform well across benchmarks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

*Xinzhuo Li,Adheesh Juvekar,Xingyou Liu,Muntasir Wahed,Kiet A. Nguyen,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalluSegBench is introduced as the first benchmark to evaluate hallucinations in vision-language segmentation using counterfactual visual reasoning, revealing prevalent vision-driven hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination lack manipulation of visual context, limiting their ability to diagnose critical failures in grounded visual understanding.

Method: HalluSegBench includes a dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs across 281 object classes and new metrics to quantify hallucination sensitivity under scene edits.

Result: Experiments show vision-driven hallucinations are more common than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning is essential for diagnosing grounding fidelity in vision-language segmentation models.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Splats efficiently updates 3D scene representations using Gaussian splatting, focusing on local changes to avoid full re-optimization, and supports temporal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient updates of 3D scene representations are needed for robotics, mixed reality, and AI, without the computational cost of full re-optimization.

Method: CL-Splats uses Gaussian splatting and a change-detection module to segment and locally optimize updated scene components, while storing previous states for temporal analysis.

Result: CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with better reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CL-Splats provides a robust foundation for real-time 3D scene adaptation, enabling new applications in temporal segmentation and analysis.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

*Muleilan Pei,Shaoshuai Shi,Lu Zhang,Peiliang Li,Shaojie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GoIRL, a Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning framework for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, outperforming supervised methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory prediction is uncertain and multimodal; existing data-driven methods rely on supervised learning, which may lack generalization.

Method: GoIRL uses vectorized context representations, a feature adaptor for lane-graph aggregation, and maximum entropy IRL to infer rewards and policies. A hierarchical trajectory generator with refinement and probability fusion enhances accuracy and confidence.

Result: GoIRL achieves state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse & nuScenes benchmarks and shows superior generalization.

Conclusion: GoIRL is a robust, multimodal trajectory predictor that outperforms supervised models, demonstrating strong generalization and accuracy.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (SIED) for extremely low-light RAW image enhancement and a diffusion-based framework with adaptive illumination correction and color consistency loss for improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack capability in extremely dark scenes (0.0001 lux) due to missing datasets.

Method: Proposes a paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline for dataset creation and a diffusion-based framework with AICM and color consistency loss.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on SIED and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method and dataset advance low-light RAW image enhancement in extreme conditions.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

*Jiawei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-FDA is a YOLO-based framework for surface defect detection, enhancing fine-grained details and feature fusion to address redundancy and robustness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defect detection is challenging due to variability in defects, shapes, and textures. Existing AI methods lack detail sensitivity and robustness.

Method: Integrates BiFPN-style architecture, Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM), and attention-based fusion strategies (AC and CAF) for improved feature aggregation and detail capture.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across diverse defect types and scales.

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA effectively addresses limitations in existing methods, offering superior performance for industrial defect detection.

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

*Junwen Wang,Oscar Maccormac,William Rochford,Aaron Kujawa,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces tree-based semantic loss functions for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation, leveraging hierarchical label organization to improve performance and OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning methods for biomedical segmentation penalize errors uniformly, ignoring inter-class semantics in the label space.

Method: Two tree-based semantic loss functions are proposed and integrated with sparse, background-free annotation training.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on a 107-class HSI dataset and effective OOD pixel detection without degrading ID pixel segmentation.

Conclusion: The method enhances segmentation by exploiting label hierarchy and improves robustness with OOD detection.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is crucial for clinical assessment and treatment planning.

Method: Fine-tuning state-of-the-art models using Kullback-Leibler loss and extensive data augmentation to handle label noise, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance.

Result: Outperforms nnU-Net, produces accurate and smooth segmentations despite noisy labels, and shows strong generalizability in out-of-distribution tests.

Conclusion: The method provides a reliable foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and supports broader clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

*Pufan Li,Bi'an Du,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method integrates geometry and perception priors to generate detailed 3D objects from single-view images, improving multiview consistency and geometric detail without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D object generation from single images suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack of geometric detail, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The method trains three Gaussian branches (geometry prior, perception prior, Gaussian noise) and refines them through mutual interaction and a reprojection-based strategy for depth consistency.

Result: The approach achieves higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions, outperforming existing methods in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method robustly and consistently generates 3D objects from single images by leveraging integrated priors and refinement strategies.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

*Longkun Zou,Kangjun Liu,Ke Chen,Kailing Guo,Kui Jia,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework addresses the Sim2Real domain gap in 3D point cloud classification by leveraging global topology and self-supervised learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Sim2Real domain gap in 3D point cloud data limits classifier generalization due to differences in data acquisition methods. Current UDA techniques lack robust descriptors for global topological information.

Method: The TAM framework uses global spatial topology and self-supervised learning to model topological relations. It also employs cross-domain contrastive learning and self-training to reduce noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: Experiments on three Sim2Real benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The TAM framework effectively mitigates the Sim2Real domain gap, enhancing the robustness and generalization of point cloud classifiers.

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-X^2L introduces bi-level KV compression and selective KV re-loading to efficiently handle long-video understanding (LVU) tasks, outperforming existing methods while saving computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV compression methods for LVU tasks suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios, necessitating a more flexible solution.

Method: Video-X^2L uses bi-level KV compression (L-KVs for fine details, H-KVs for compactness) and selective KV re-loading during decoding to balance detail retention and computational efficiency.

Result: Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench while saving computation costs.

Conclusion: Video-X^2L is a simple, effective, and training-free solution for LVU tasks, compatible with existing MLLMs.

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction (OccOoD) to detect anomalies in 3D voxel space, using synthetic datasets and a novel framework for improved safety in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction struggle with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, posing safety risks in autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline to create datasets (VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360) and introduces OccOoD, a framework with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) for OoD detection.

Result: OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection (AuROC: 67.34%, AuPRCr: 29.21%) while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance.

Conclusion: The work addresses safety hazards in autonomous driving by improving OoD detection, with datasets and code made publicly available.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m
region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroundFlow, a plug-in module for temporal reasoning in 3D point cloud sequential grounding, improves 3DVG methods by leveraging historical step information, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DVG methods fail to extract temporal information from multi-step instructions, especially with pronouns, limiting their effectiveness in sequential grounding tasks.

Method: Proposes GroundFlow, a module for temporal reasoning that selectively extracts short-term and long-term step information to enhance context understanding.

Result: GroundFlow improves baseline methods by +7.5% and +10.2% in SG3D benchmarks, outperforming even pre-trained 3D large language models.

Conclusion: GroundFlow introduces temporal reasoning to 3DVG models, achieving top performance in SG3D benchmarks across five datasets.

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UNLOCK, a source-free method for panoramic image segmentation, addressing distortions and occlusions without needing labeled source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image processing faces challenges like distortions and limited annotations, and existing methods require source data. The goal is to enable segmentation without relying on labeled source data.

Method: UNLOCK uses Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning to adapt models without source data or target labels, achieving 360° coverage and occlusion-aware reasoning.

Result: UNLOCK matches source-dependent methods, achieving state-of-the-art scores (10.9 mAAP, 11.6 mAP) and +4.3 mAPQ improvement over source-only methods.

Conclusion: UNLOCK is a practical, source-free solution for panoramic segmentation, outperforming existing methods and setting a benchmark for the SFOASS task.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: MedPrompt is a unified framework combining a few-shot prompted LLM (Llama-4-17B) for task planning and a modular CNN (DeepFusionLab) for image processing, enabling scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image analysis systems are task-specific and inflexible, requiring separate models for different tasks. MedPrompt aims to unify these workflows.

Method: Uses an LLM for task interpretation and structured output generation, routing task-specific pretrained weights dynamically without retraining the entire framework.

Result: Achieves 97% correctness in prompt-driven tasks, 2.5s average latency, and competitive accuracy (Dice 0.9856 for segmentation, F1 0.9744 for classification).

Conclusion: MedPrompt successfully combines LLM interpretability with CNN efficiency, offering scalable, real-time medical image analysis.

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

### [107] [BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21209)
*Louis Kerner,Michel Meintz,Bihe Zhao,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BitMark is a robust bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity models to prevent model collapse by embedding detectable signals in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of model collapse due to reuse of generated content as training data necessitates a solution like watermarking to identify and mitigate degradation.

Method: BitMark embeds watermarks at the bit level of token streams across multiple scales during image generation, ensuring visual fidelity and robustness.

Result: BitMark maintains generation speed, resists removal techniques, and exhibits radioactivity, ensuring traces persist in downstream models.

Conclusion: BitMark offers a reliable method to detect generated outputs, mitigating model collapse in image generative models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) framework focusing on data quality, outperforming existing methods by leveraging a high-quality reference set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVS methods rely on pre-trained models or synthetic data, limiting performance due to model capability or poor reference quality. This work addresses the overlooked data quality issue.

Method: Proposes a data-quality-oriented framework with a pipeline for constructing a high-quality reference set and a simple similarity-based retrieval method.

Result: Outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches on ten benchmark datasets, emphasizing the impact of data-centric design.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of data quality in advancing training-free OVS, with the framework's effectiveness demonstrated through extensive evaluations.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

TL;DR: DiMPLe disentangles invariant and spurious features in multi-modal learning, improving OOD performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spurious correlations in visual data that hinder out-of-distribution performance.

Method: Combines mutual information minimization, spurious feature regularization, and contrastive learning on invariant features.

Result: Outperforms CoOp-OOD, with gains of 15.27 in base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Conclusion: DiMPLe effectively disentangles features, enhancing robustness and generalization in multi-modal learning.

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

*Xianghan Meng,Zhengyu Tong,Zhiyuan Huang,Chun-Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (TR²C) for Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), outperforming existing subspace clustering methods by learning structured representations and affinity from video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subspace clustering methods assume high-dimensional temporal data follows a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution, but complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds often violate this assumption, necessitating a better approach.

Method: The proposed TR²C method jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment frame sequences, ensuring temporally consistent representations aligned with a UoS structure.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets show TR²C achieves state-of-the-art performance with various feature extractors.

Conclusion: TR²C is a novel and effective approach for HMS, addressing limitations of subspace clustering by leveraging structured learning.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

*Munish Monga,Vishal Chudasama,Pankaj Wasnik,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DuIOD and DuET for handling class and domain shifts in object detection, outperforming existing methods with improved retention and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CIOD and DIOD) fail to address both class and domain shifts simultaneously, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework with Directional Consistency Loss, detector-agnostic for real-time use.

Result: DuET achieves +13.12% RAI on Pascal Series and +11.39% RAI on Diverse Weather Series, with high Avg RI retention.

Conclusion: DuET effectively handles dual incremental learning, offering practical improvements for real-world object detection.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

### [113] [Video Virtual Try-on with Conditional Diffusion Transformer Inpainter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21270)
*Cheng Zou,Senlin Cheng,Bolei Xu,Dandan Zheng,Xiaobo Li,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTI proposes a video virtual try-on method using conditional video inpainting with a Diffusion Transformer, achieving better spatial-temporal consistency than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video try-on methods suffer from inconsistency issues when adapting image-based techniques frame by frame or using temporal attention. ViTI aims to address this by treating try-on as a video inpainting task.

Method: ViTI formulates video try-on as conditional video inpainting, using a Diffusion Transformer with 3D spatial-temporal attention. It employs masking strategies and multi-stage training for garment inpainting.

Result: ViTI outperforms previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating superior spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail preservation.

Conclusion: ViTI's video inpainting approach effectively solves inconsistency issues in video virtual try-on, offering a robust solution for realistic garment fitting in videos.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Text-Image Alignment (TIA) framework and WordCon, a hybrid PEFT method, to improve word-level typography control in generated images. It leverages cross-modal correspondence and masked loss for better text-region learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise word-level typography control in generated images is challenging, requiring better alignment between text and image regions.

Method: The TIA framework uses grounding models for cross-modal correspondence. WordCon, a hybrid PEFT method, reparameterizes key parameters for efficiency. Masked and joint-attention losses enhance controllability.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative results show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves word-level typography control and is adaptable to diverse pipelines. Datasets and code will be available for academic use.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

*Diego Biagini,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraSurg is a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework using two diffusion models to ensure consistency with surgical actions and phases, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical video generation lacks consistency with surgical actions and phases, requiring fine-grained guidance for factual simulation.

Method: HieraSurg uses two diffusion models: one predicts coarse-grained semantic changes, and the other generates the final video by augmenting segmentation maps with visual features.

Result: The model outperforms prior work, showing strong generalization and higher frame-rate video generation, with fine-grained adherence to segmentation maps.

Conclusion: HieraSurg's hierarchical approach enables practical surgical applications by integrating multi-level surgical information.

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CoSMAE, a continual self-supervised learning method using masked autoencoders, combining data and model mixup to reduce catastrophic forgetting in remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high cost of labeled training samples in remote sensing by developing a self-supervised CL method.

Method: Uses data mixup (interpolating images) and model mixup knowledge distillation (interpolating model weights) to regularize learning.

Result: Achieves up to 4.94% improvement over state-of-the-art CL methods.

Conclusion: CoSMAE effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances generalization in continual learning for remote sensing.

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for human-centric tasks by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features, creating a specialized dataset and benchmark. Fine-tuning the LLaVA-1.5-7B model with this data yields a 33.2% performance improvement.

Motivation: Current VLMs underperform in human pose and action understanding due to a lack of specialized data.

Method: Generates a dataset (200,328 samples) combining human keypoints, captions, and bounding boxes, and fine-tunes the LLaVA-1.5-7B model.

Result: The fine-tuned LLaVA-Pose model achieves a 33.2% improvement over the original model on the E-HPAUB benchmark.

Conclusion: Keypoint-integrated data significantly enhances VLMs for human-centric visual understanding.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the

TL;DR: A hierarchical state space model for efficient surgical workflow analysis in long robot-assisted surgery videos, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long surgical videos challenge existing transformer models due to quadratic attention costs; a scalable solution is needed.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical state space model with local and global modules, trained via hybrid discrete-continuous supervision.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by +2.8% to +12.9% on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The model efficiently processes full-length videos, capturing both local and global dynamics, with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanSt3R is a unified method for 3D panoptic segmentation that avoids test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view segmentation in a single forward pass, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on 2D panoptic segmentation and require costly test-time optimization, failing to fully utilize spatial relationships across views. PanSt3R addresses these limitations by integrating 3D reconstruction and segmentation.

Method: PanSt3R builds on MUSt3R, enhancing it with semantic awareness and multi-view panoptic segmentation. It introduces a principled mask merging approach and a novel-view prediction method using 3DGS.

Result: PanSt3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and is significantly faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: PanSt3R offers a simple, fast, and scalable solution for 3D panoptic segmentation, eliminating the need for test-time optimization and leveraging multi-view spatial relationships effectively.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

### [121] [Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21349)
*Yizhe Cheng,Chunxun Tian,Haoru Wang,Wentao Zhu,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-driven framework for solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is proposed, improving generalization and robustness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning approaches like Img-Interiors lack generalization and fail under sparse transmitter setups, prompting a physics-informed solution.

Method: The framework reformulates EISP as a two-stage process, using induced current as an intermediate representation, and includes a current estimator and permittivity solver for end-to-end prediction.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, generalization, and robustness, especially under sparse transmitter conditions.

Conclusion: This work provides a new perspective on EISP, advancing practical electromagnetic imaging solutions.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShotBench is a benchmark for cinematic language understanding, revealing VLMs' limitations. ShotQA and ShotVL are introduced to improve performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack proficiency in nuanced cinematic grammar, limiting AI-assisted video generation.

Method: Developed ShotBench (3.5k QA pairs) and ShotQA (70k QA pairs), then fine-tuned ShotVL using supervised learning and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Top VLMs scored <60% accuracy on ShotBench; ShotVL outperformed all models, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: ShotVL advances cinematic understanding, with open-sourced resources to accelerate progress in AI-driven film analysis.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the data bottleneck in 2D scene graph understanding due to lack of accurate and exhaustive annotations.

Method: Introduce CoPa-SG, a synthetic dataset with precise ground truth and new relation types (parametric and proto-relations).

Result: Demonstrated improved scene graph generation model performance and enhanced planning/reasoning in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG and new relation types advance scene graph understanding and application capabilities.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

*Behrooz Nasihatkon,Hossein Resani,Amirreza Mehrzadian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToosiCubix is a monocular image-based method for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles, requiring minimal user input and no specialized equipment, validated against KITTI and Cityscapes3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on expensive setups, limiting accessibility for large-scale data collection.

Method: Uses 10 user clicks per vehicle, formulates geometric constraints as an optimization problem solved via coordinate descent, and incorporates probabilistic size priors.

Result: Accurately estimates vehicle position, orientation, and dimensions (8 DoF), with 9 DoF placements using priors.

Conclusion: Offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid annotation.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CAA and GOS modules to improve image-to-point cloud registration by addressing feature channel attention differences and redundant correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds degrade matching results, and similar scene structures cause redundant correspondences.

Method: Introduces Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) to enhance intra-modal features and suppress cross-modal sensitivity, and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS) for global optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CAA and GOS modules effectively improve registration accuracy by addressing feature mismatches and redundancy.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

### [127] [FastRef:Fast Prototype Refinement for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21398)
*Long Tian,Yufei Li,Yuyang Dai,Wenchao Chen,Xiyang Liu,Bo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastRef is a prototype refinement framework for few-shot industrial anomaly detection, enhancing representativeness through iterative characteristic transfer and anomaly suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of query image statistics in existing FS-IAD methods to improve prototype representativeness in data-scarce settings.

Method: Iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer via optimizable transformation matrix, (2) anomaly suppression using optimal transport for non-Gaussian features.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency across four benchmark datasets (MVTec, ViSA, MPDD, RealIAD) under 1/2/4-shots.

Conclusion: FastRef improves FS-IAD by refining prototypes with query statistics and suppressing anomalies, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

### [128] [Curve-Aware Gaussian Splatting for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21401)
*Zhirui Gao. Renjiao Yi,Yaqiao Dai,Xuening Zhu,Wei Chen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a one-stage framework, CurveGaussian, for 3D parametric curve reconstruction from multi-view edge maps, outperforming two-stage methods by eliminating error accumulation and enabling differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage methods for 3D curve reconstruction suffer from error accumulation due to disconnected optimization stages. The paper aims to address this by proposing a direct, one-stage approach.

Method: The framework combines parametric curves with edge-oriented Gaussian components (CurveGaussian) for differentiable rendering. It includes dynamic topology optimization (linearization, merging, splitting, pruning) to refine curves.

Result: Evaluations on ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks show cleaner, more robust reconstructions and reduced parameter count, achieving higher efficiency and performance than two-stage methods.

Conclusion: The one-stage CurveGaussian framework outperforms two-stage alternatives, offering direct optimization of parametric curves with improved efficiency and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XVerse enables precise, independent control over multiple subjects in text-to-image generation, improving fidelity and editability without disrupting image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-subject control in text-to-image generation often cause artifacts or attribute entanglement, limiting editability and coherence.

Method: XVerse transforms reference images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, allowing independent subject control.

Result: The model achieves high-fidelity, editable multi-subject synthesis with robust control over individual attributes.

Conclusion: XVerse significantly enhances personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces optical flow loss and depth regularization to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for endoscopic SLAM, addressing photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion. Enhanced refinement strategies further boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in endoscopic scenarios, such as non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic motion, degrade SLAM performance. Existing 3DGS-based methods lack geometric constraints.

Method: Proposes optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, depth regularization for photometric inconsistencies, and improved 3DGS refinement focusing on keyframes with poor rendering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation on static (C3VD) and dynamic (StereoMIS) datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances 3D reconstruction and rendering in endoscopic SLAM, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSORT introduces a hyper-network framework to address biases in medical imaging datasets by learning a distribution of UNet parameters, enabling bias identification and robust segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets often contain biases that degrade deep segmentation performance, but identifying these biases is challenging.

Method: HyperSORT uses a hyper-network to predict UNet parameters from latent vectors representing image and annotation variability, jointly learning hyper-network parameters and latent vectors.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real datasets, HyperSORT maps dataset biases, identifies errors, and clusters latent spaces for meaningful segmentation.

Conclusion: HyperSORT effectively structures datasets to uncover biases and improve segmentation robustness, with code and analysis publicly available.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks deep learning approaches for classifying atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in breast cancer, introducing new datasets and achieving high accuracy with LoRA-based adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitoses are prognostically relevant but hard to identify due to low prevalence, subtle differences, and dataset imbalances.

Method: Compared deep learning models (baseline, foundation models with linear probing, LoRA fine-tuning) on AMi-Br and new datasets (AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD).

Result: Achieved balanced accuracies up to 0.8135 (AMi-Br), 0.7696 (AtNorM-Br), and 0.7705 (AtNorM-MD), with LoRA-based adaptation performing best.

Conclusion: Atypical mitosis classification can be effectively addressed using transfer learning and fine-tuning, with LoRA-based models showing promise.

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for precise object placement in images using visual maps and coarse masks, resolving ambiguities while allowing shape and orientation changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-conditioned generative models lack precision in object placement, requiring complex masks or prompts.

Method: Uses a visual map and coarse masks as conditioning signals, built on an inpainting model to preserve the background.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality object placement with accurate pose and location, even with shape changes.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines location and appearance control for precise object placement in scenes.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underground mining safety challenges require reliable miner detection for emergency response, but current datasets for deep learning are lacking.

Method: A novel thermal imaging dataset was created, and algorithms like YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR were evaluated for miner detection.

Result: The dataset provides a foundation for developing thermal-based miner detection systems, with baseline performance metrics established.

Conclusion: Thermal imaging is feasible for miner detection, and this work lays the groundwork for future research in mining safety.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LF-CFG addresses oversaturation and artifacts in diffusion models by targeting redundant low-frequency signals with adaptive thresholds and down-weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High guidance scales in CFG cause oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts, prompting the need for a solution.

Method: LF-CFG uses adaptive thresholds to identify redundant low-frequency signals and down-weights them to mitigate issues.

Result: LF-CFG effectively reduces oversaturation and artifacts in models like Stable Diffusion-XL and SiT-XL.

Conclusion: LF-CFG offers a practical solution to improve diffusion model performance by addressing low-frequency signal redundancy.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

### [136] [Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21469)
*Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi,Hung-Fu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes dynamic, static, and hybrid methods for traffic signal design using turning movement count (TMC) data. A vision-based system estimates TMC, and simulations show optimal cycle times and method effectiveness for different traffic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic signal design is essential for efficient traffic flow and congestion management. Existing methods may not adapt well to varying traffic conditions, prompting the need for dynamic and hybrid approaches.

Method: Developed a vision-based tracking system to estimate TMC, synthesized intersection data for simulation, and tested static, dynamic, and hybrid signal timing methods in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO).

Result: Optimal cycle times of 90 and 120 seconds were identified. Dynamic methods performed better for four intersections, while a hybrid method adapted well to bimodal traffic patterns. Zone-based traffic distributions influenced method selection.

Conclusion: The hybrid method, switching between dynamic and static configurations, is effective for managing peak and off-peak traffic, especially in zones with uneven traffic distribution.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

*Srikumar Sastry,Aayush Dhakal,Eric Xing,Subash Khanal,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME) to model transitive entailment in vision-language models, improving hierarchical representation and outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to explicitly model the transitive nature of entailment, which is crucial for hierarchical data structure in vision-language models.

Method: Proposes RCME, a framework optimizing partial order of concepts to enforce transitive entailment, applied to hierarchical vision-language tasks.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in hierarchical species classification and retrieval tasks compared to existing models.

Conclusion: RCME effectively models hierarchical data structure, enhancing vision-language models for tasks requiring semantic order and hierarchy.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

### [138] [TITAN: Query-Token based Domain Adaptive Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21484)
*Tajamul Ashraf,Janibul Bashir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TITAN, a method for source-free domain adaptive object detection, addressing pseudo-label noise and domain shifts by partitioning target images and using adversarial modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle performance degradation in student-teacher frameworks due to noisy pseudo-labels caused by domain bias and shifts.

Method: Partitions target images into easy/hard subsets based on variance, and integrates query-token adversarial modules into a student-teacher framework.

Result: Achieves significant mAP improvements over SOTA methods on multiple datasets, with gains up to +22.7%.

Conclusion: TITAN effectively mitigates domain shifts and pseudo-label noise, outperforming existing methods in source-free domain adaptation.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

### [139] [Towards Reliable Detection of Empty Space: Conditional Marked Point Processes for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21486)
*Tobias J. Riedlinger,Kira Maag,Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses miscalibrated confidence estimates in object detection models, proposing a statistical framework for better uncertainty quantification, especially in empty regions, to improve safety in applications like automated driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detectors lack proper uncertainty quantification outside detected bounding boxes, posing safety risks in critical applications like automated driving.

Method: The authors propose an object detection model based on spatial statistics, using a marked point process to describe bounding box data and likelihood-based training for well-defined confidence estimates.

Result: The method demonstrates improved calibration and performance in uncertainty estimation, particularly in identifying drivable (object-free) regions.

Conclusion: The statistical framework provides a robust solution for uncertainty quantification in object detection, enhancing safety in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

### [140] [Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509)
*Jiahe Chen,Jiaying He,Qian Shao,Qiyuan Chen,Jiahe Ying,Hongxia Xu,Jintai Chen,Jianwei Zheng,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a training-free decoding framework to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by dynamically aligning text generation with visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding strategies for LVLMs suffer from static constraints, inefficiency, and loss of detail, leading to hallucinations—text contradicting visual input.

Method: DLC uses CLIP to assess semantic alignment between images and generated text, evaluates candidate tokens' Relative Visual Advantage (RVA), and employs adaptive weighting to balance visual guidance and text quality.

Result: DLC significantly reduces hallucinations across benchmarks and LVLM architectures (e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP) while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DLC is an effective, efficient decoding-time solution to enhance LVLM reliability by mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

*Wentao Hu,Shunkai Li,Ziqiao Peng,Haoxian Zhang,Fan Shi,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Hui Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGTalker improves speech-driven 3D talking heads by combining generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation, achieving high-quality results with better 3D consistency and lip-sync accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with large head rotations, OOD audio, and require identity-specific training, lacking sufficient 3D priors for generalization.

Method: GGTalker uses a two-stage Prior-Adaptation strategy: learning Gaussian head priors (Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual) and adapting to individual characteristics. It includes a color MLP for textures and a Body Inpainter for blending.

Result: GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: GGTalker addresses limitations of previous methods by leveraging generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation, producing photorealistic and consistent results.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

*Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gradient-Guided Distillation (G²D) addresses modality imbalance in multimodal learning by using a custom loss function and dynamic modality prioritization, improving performance on weak modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: G²D employs a knowledge distillation framework with a fused loss function and dynamic Sequential Modality Prioritization (SMP) to balance modality contributions.

Result: G²D enhances weak modality utilization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: G²D effectively mitigates modality imbalance and improves multimodal learning performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MADrive enhances scene reconstruction by replacing observed vehicles with similar 3D assets from a memory bank, enabling photorealistic synthesis of altered driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstructions are limited to original observations and lack support for novel or altered driving scenarios.

Method: Uses a memory-augmented framework (MADrive) with a retrieval module to replace vehicles using a dataset (MAD-Cars) and integrates them into scenes via orientation alignment and relighting.

Result: Enables photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered vehicle configurations in reconstructed scenes.

Conclusion: MADrive extends the capabilities of scene reconstruction methods for autonomous driving environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

TL;DR: WAFT is a novel optical flow method replacing cost volume with high-resolution warping, outperforming RAFT in accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the necessity of cost volumes in optical flow methods and propose a simpler, more efficient alternative.

Method: Uses high-resolution warping instead of cost volumes, reducing memory usage and complexity.

Result: Achieves top performance on Spring and KITTI benchmarks, best zero-shot generalization, and 4.1x speedup over comparable methods.

Conclusion: WAFT proves cost volumes aren't essential for high performance, offering a simpler, faster, and more accurate alternative.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.
Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks,
achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x
faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in cross-modal image-text retrieval by proposing a set-based approach with novel loss functions to improve semantic diversity and matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-vector embeddings struggle with nuanced cross-modal relationships, while set-based methods face issues like sparse supervision and set collapse.

Method: Proposes Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity for one-to-one matching between embedding sets, along with Global Discriminative Loss and Intra-Set Divergence Loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k without external data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances set-based representations for cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

TL;DR: StruMamba3D improves Mamba-based point cloud learning by preserving spatial dependencies, enhancing SSM with state-wise updates, and adapting to varying input lengths, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods destroy point adjacency and fail to retain long-sequence memory in point cloud tasks.

Method: Proposes StruMamba3D with spatial states, state-wise SSM updates, lightweight convolution, and sequence length-adaptive strategy.

Result: Achieves 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% on ScanObjectNN, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: StruMamba3D effectively addresses limitations of SSM in point cloud learning, demonstrating superior performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for occlusion-aware multi-view generation from a single partially occluded image, enabling consistent 3D reconstruction without prior inpainting or manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of 3D reconstruction from occluded single images, where existing methods fail due to inconsistent views.

Method: An end-to-end framework trained self-supervised using occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views, fine-tuning a view synthesis model for joint completion and multi-view generation.

Result: The method synthesizes six structurally consistent novel views from occluded inputs, improving downstream 3D reconstruction. A benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction is also introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances occlusion-aware 3D reconstruction, offering a standardized benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Motivation: To address the challenges of cross-modal segmentation and annotation bottlenecks in autonomous driving scenes.

Method: Introduces UMPE for feature alignment and MCMA for temporal consistency. Uses a multi-modal automated data engine for pseudo-label generation.

Result: Demonstrates robust segmentation and fast pseudo-label generation on Waymo-4DSeg.

Conclusion: SAM4D shows strong cross-modal segmentation and data annotation potential.

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of benchmarks for comprehensive 3D ADS, especially in manufacturing where single-instance training and synthetic-to-real generalization are crucial.

Method: Introduces a novel multimodal multiview dataset with high-resolution images, point clouds, and CAD models, and adapts singleview methods for baseline performance.

Result: Provides annotated 3D segmentation ground truths and evaluates adapted methods using new metrics for Anomaly Volumes.

Conclusion: SiM3D sets a new standard for 3D ADS benchmarks, enabling research in multiview and multimodal anomaly detection.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simulate how human actions shape the environment from a first-person view, addressing challenges in modeling complex real-world environments and embodied behaviors.

Method: Uses an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer, trained on the Nymeria dataset (egocentric video and body pose capture), structured by body joint hierarchy.

Result: Develops a hierarchical evaluation protocol to analyze the model's prediction and control abilities, demonstrating its capability to simulate human actions in real-world environments.

Conclusion: PEVA represents a pioneering effort in modeling embodied agent behaviors and complex environments through egocentric video prediction.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

*Can Liu,Chunlin Da,Xiaoxiao Long,Yuxiao Yang,Yu Zhang,Yong Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A novel multimodal LLM approach improves visualization understanding by combining chart images with vectorized representations, enhancing data extraction and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with visualization comprehension due to their inability to decode data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information.

Method: The approach trains multimodal visualization LLMs using a dataset that pairs chart images with vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in data extraction accuracy and chart reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses visualization comprehension challenges, offering a compact and accurate vector format for reconstruction.

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data
relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural
image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to
decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To
address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal
visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach
combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,
encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact
and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart
reconstruction quality.

### [153] [Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21298)
*Atharva Mehta,Shivam Chauhan,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores adapter-based PEFT techniques for fine-tuning music generation models (MusicGen and Mustango) on low-resource genres, analyzing trade-offs between adapter types and their impact on performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of fine-tuning large music models and the lack of clarity in optimal adapter design for low-resource music genres.

Method: Study various adapter configurations (convolution-based and transformer-based) for MusicGen and Mustango on Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, evaluating performance and resource requirements.

Result: Convolution-based adapters capture local musical details better, while transformer-based adapters preserve long-range dependencies. Mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) balance expressivity and quality. Mustango (diffusion-based) offers diverse outputs but is computationally intensive, while MusicGen (autoregressive) is faster and more efficient.

Conclusion: Adapter design significantly impacts music generation performance, with trade-offs between detail capture, long-range dependencies, and computational efficiency. Mid-sized adapters and autoregressive models like MusicGen offer practical advantages.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

### [154] [Leaner Training, Lower Leakage: Revisiting Memorization in LLM Fine-Tuning with LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20856)
*Fei Wang,Baochun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines memorization in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs, showing it reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand memorization in fine-tuning, especially LoRA, and its divergence from pre-training and full fine-tuning trends.

Method: Uses a similarity-based memorization metric to compare LoRA and full fine-tuning, analyzing factors like model scale and data duplication.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning significantly lowers memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, without compromising task performance.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning is a safer alternative for reducing memorization risks in LLMs while preserving effectiveness.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

### [155] [SharpZO: Hybrid Sharpness-Aware Vision Language Model Prompt Tuning via Forward-Only Passes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20990)
*Yifan Yang,Zhen Zhang,Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan,Jing Liu,Nathan Susanj,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharpZO is a hybrid method combining sharpness-aware warm-up training and zeroth-order optimization to fine-tune VLMs without backpropagation, outperforming existing forward-only methods by up to 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs without backpropagation is challenging due to reliance on high-variance methods like ES or ZO, which often underperform. SharpZO aims to address this gap.

Method: SharpZO uses a two-stage process: sharpness-aware ES for global exploration and smoothing, followed by sparse ZO optimization for fine-grained local search, relying only on forward passes.

Result: SharpZO achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art forward-only methods, validated on CLIP models.

Conclusion: SharpZO effectively enhances ZO VLM fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for memory-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

### [156] [Enhancing LLM Tool Use with High-quality Instruction Data from Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21071)
*Jingwei Wang,Zai Zhang,Hao Qian,Chunjing Gan,Binbin Hu,Ziqi Liu,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou,Bin Shi,Bo Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using knowledge graphs to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs improves tool utilization and problem-solving abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching LLMs to use tools effectively is challenging due to insufficient quality of instruction data generated by LLMs themselves.

Method: Extracts query pathways from knowledge graphs, transforms them into user queries, and translates entity relationships into actionable tools and solution steps.

Result: Fine-tuning on synthetic data significantly enhances LLMs' tool utilization and capabilities.

Conclusion: Knowledge graphs provide a robust solution for generating high-quality instruction data, improving LLMs' performance with tools.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

### [157] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel architecture dynamically skips middle Transformer layers for efficiency, but fails to outperform dense baselines in compute-performance trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce redundancy in middle Transformer layers and improve efficiency by dynamically skipping layers based on input complexity.

Method: Uses a learned gating mechanism to skip symmetric spans of central blocks, gated attention to prevent skipped token attention, and controls norms/sparsity with regularization.

Result: No improvement in validation cross-entropy vs. FLOPs trade-off compared to fewer-layer dense baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method does not achieve efficiency gains at tested scales; code is released for further exploration.

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

*Andrey Goncharov,Daniil Vyazhev,Petr Sychev,Edvard Khalafyan,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient fine-tuning method for LLMs using entropy-based complexity categorization, outperforming standard SFT and matching distillation with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and data requirements of fine-tuning LLMs while maintaining performance.

Method: Splits training data by entropy, applies SFT and distillation selectively, and validates with small models.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy (0.55 vs 0.43) than standard SFT and matches distillation with 62% less data.

Conclusion: The method offers a cost-effective alternative for fine-tuning LLMs, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiLoCoX is a decentralized training framework for large models (100B+ parameters) on slow networks, combining pipeline parallelism, dual optimizer policy, and adaptive gradient compression for significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the dependency on centralized clusters with fast interconnects for training large models by enabling efficient decentralized training on slower networks.

Method: Combines Pipeline Parallelism, Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and Adaptive Gradient Compression.

Result: Achieves 357x speedup over vanilla AllReduce for a 107B model on a 1Gbps network with negligible convergence degradation.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX successfully enables decentralized training of models exceeding 100B parameters, marking a significant advancement in scalable distributed training.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

*Jiajie Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Prototype Routing (LPR) to address load imbalance in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, achieving near-perfect balance without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE systems suffer from severe load imbalance, underutilizing model capacity and resources.

Method: Proposes LPR, a novel routing framework based on clustering, generalizing existing approaches for balanced expert utilization.

Result: LPR reduces Gini coefficient from 0.70 to 0.035 and improves min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70.

Conclusion: LPR effectively balances expert load in MoE models, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

*Colin Samplawski,Adam D. Cobb,Manoj Acharya,Ramneet Kaur,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScalaBL introduces a scalable Bayesian low-rank adaptation method for LLMs, achieving competitive performance with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of uncertainty quantification in LLMs, especially in high-stakes domains, where existing methods struggle with scalability.

Method: Performs Bayesian inference in an r-dimensional subspace using LoRA parameters as projection matrices, enabling stochastic variational inference.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches using only ~1000 additional parameters and scales to larger LLMs.

Conclusion: ScalaBL offers a scalable and efficient solution for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in LLMs.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

*Furkan Mumcu,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight regression model to detect adversarial examples by analyzing feature discrepancies across DNN layers, offering a universal and efficient defense method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses are either ineffective or computationally inefficient. This work focuses on practical attack detection.

Method: A regression model predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, using prediction error to detect adversarial samples.

Result: The method is highly effective, efficient for real-time processing, and compatible with various DNN architectures and domains.

Conclusion: The proposed detection approach is a practical and universal solution for defending against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

*Suorong Yang,Peijia Li,Furao Shen,Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RL-Selector, a reinforcement learning-based method for efficient data selection in deep learning, outperforming existing methods by leveraging dynamic sample relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep models on large datasets is computationally expensive, and existing data selection methods fail to account for evolving sample dynamics.

Method: Proposes RL-Selector, using epsilon-sample cover to quantify redundancy and a lightweight RL agent to optimize selection policies dynamically.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving generalization and training efficiency across benchmarks.

Conclusion: RL-Selector offers a scalable, dynamic solution for data-efficient deep learning.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: pFedDC is a personalized federated learning framework using dual-prompt learning and cross fusion to address data, computation, and communication heterogeneity in FL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt-learning methods overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts and rely only on text prompts.

Method: pFedDC uses global and local prompts across vision and language modalities, with a cross-fusion module to integrate them adaptively.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show pFedDC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: pFedDC effectively addresses heterogeneity in FL by leveraging dual-prompt learning and cross fusion.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Generative Blocks World enables interactive scene editing in generated images using 3D primitives, with improved texture consistency and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the editability and visual fidelity of generated images by representing scenes as manipulable 3D primitives.

Method: Scenes are represented as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, edited interactively, and regenerated using a flow-based method conditioned on depth and texture hints.

Result: Outperforms prior works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust framework for interactive scene editing with high visual quality and texture consistency.

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work entangled hair and face modeling; this paper aims to separate them for better composability and variation capture.

Method: Uses template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting for deformable hair geometry, dual generators, and cross-attention to model hair-face correlation. Trained on synthetic renderings with specialized objectives.

Result: Validated through extensive experiments, outperforming state-of-the-art 3D GAN methods in full-head synthesis and hairstyle editing.

Conclusion: 3DGH effectively enables composable 3D hairstyle editing and unconditional full-head image synthesis.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

Method: VideoTex uses geometry-aware conditions and a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy to enhance texture synthesis, ensuring smooth transitions and semantic preservation.

Result: VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and temporal stability, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VideoTex advances dynamic real-time applications by providing high-quality, temporally coherent textures.

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

### [168] [FairyGen: Storied Cartoon Video from a Single Child-Drawn Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21272)
*Jiayi Zheng,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FairyGen is an automatic system that generates story-driven cartoon videos from a child's drawing, preserving artistic style and incorporating cinematic storytelling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create personalized and engaging animations from children's drawings while maintaining visual consistency and expressive storytelling.

Method: Uses an MLLM for structured storyboard generation, style propagation for visual consistency, a shot design module for cinematic quality, and a 3D proxy for motion sequences. A two-stage motion customization adapter ensures identity and motion disentanglement.

Result: Produces stylistically faithful, narratively structured animations with natural motion.

Conclusion: FairyGen demonstrates potential for personalized story animation, offering a novel approach to preserving artistic style and enhancing storytelling.

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

*Ghazal Al-Shwayyat,Omer Nezih Gerek*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining MFCC+CNN and DWT+RNN for Arabic dialect recognition show MFCC+CNN outperforms with 91.2% accuracy, highlighting spectral features' effectiveness in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of Arabic dialect recognition due to linguistic diversity and scarce annotated datasets, especially for underrepresented dialects.

Method: Developed two hybrid models: MFCC+CNN and DWT+RNN, trained on a dialect-filtered subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset.

Result: MFCC+CNN achieved 91.2% accuracy, outperforming DWT+RNN (66.5%), with strong precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Conclusion: Spectral features with convolutional models are effective for Arabic dialect recognition in low-resource scenarios, with future research directions identified.

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong
baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: ThinkSound is a framework using Chain-of-Thought reasoning for stepwise, interactive video-to-audio generation and editing, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-fidelity audio from videos requires nuanced reasoning about visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships, which current methods struggle with.

Method: ThinkSound decomposes the process into three stages: foundational foley generation, interactive object-centric refinement, and targeted editing guided by natural language, using a multimodal large language model for reasoning.

Result: ThinkSound outperforms existing methods in video-to-audio generation, excelling in both audio and CoT metrics, and performs well on out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThinkSound advances video-to-audio generation by integrating structured reasoning and interactive refinement, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both
audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio
benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Demo.github.io.

*Alexander Selivanov,Philip Müller,Özgün Turgut,Nil Stolt-Ansó,Daniel Rückert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PTACL is a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG representations by integrating CMR data, improving cardiac diagnostics without additional learnable weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG lacks functional cardiac parameters like ventricular volumes, while CMR is costly and less accessible. PTACL aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PTACL uses global patient-level and local temporal-level contrastive losses to align ECG and CMR data, enriching ECG representations.

Result: PTACL outperforms baselines in retrieving similar cardiac phenotypes and predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters.

Conclusion: PTACL enhances ECG-based diagnostics by leveraging CMR insights, offering a cost-effective alternative to CMR.

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces U-R-Veda, a deep learning model combining UNet, vision transformers, and attention mechanisms for accurate cardiac MRI segmentation, achieving 95.2% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated and precise segmentation of cardiac images is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiac disorders, requiring advanced AI solutions.

Method: Proposes U-R-Veda, integrating convolution transformations, vision transformers, residual links, channel-spatial attention, and edge-detection skip-connections for CMR image segmentation.

Result: U-R-Veda achieves 95.2% accuracy (DSC metrics), outperforming other models, especially in right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium delineation.

Conclusion: The model significantly improves CMR image segmentation, enhancing automated medical image analysis for cardiac disorders.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a
transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of
cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of
cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and
automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The
model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD
metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and
left-ventricle-myocardium.

TL;DR: A deep learning model using modeled spectra improves spectral analysis accuracy under B0 inhomogeneity by enhancing training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of spectral analysis accuracy degradation due to static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity.

Method: Proposed a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra generated from B0 maps and metabolite ratios, integrating subregions and evaluating against measured spectra.

Result: Modeled spectra closely matched measured spectra, reducing MSE by 49.89% compared to using measured spectra alone and outperforming LCModel in MAPEs.

Conclusion: The method enhances spectral analysis accuracy by leveraging modeled spectra, showing promise for broader applications.

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method to improve JPEG image quality by leveraging DCT coefficient correlations, outperforming pixel-domain methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing JPEG enhancement methods in the pixel domain are computationally expensive, while DCT-domain methods lack performance. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The AJQE method identifies and exploits two critical types of correlations in DCT coefficients, adapting pixel-domain models to the DCT domain for better performance.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 0.35 dB PSNR improvement and a 60.5% increase in enhancement throughput compared to pixel-domain methods.

Conclusion: The AJQE method effectively enhances JPEG images in the DCT domain, offering superior performance and reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

Motivation: To improve brain tumor segmentation accuracy and robustness while reducing reliance on fully annotated datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A zero-shot denoising framework for low-angle CPWC ultrasound enhances contrast without training data by using self-supervised learning on disjoint angle subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPWC improves image quality but reduces frame rate and introduces noise/blurring. Existing methods lack adaptability and require training data.

Method: Divides transmission angles into subsets to create noisy images, trains a lightweight deep model via self-supervised residual learning to suppress noise while preserving structures.

Result: Superior contrast enhancement and structure preservation compared to classical and deep learning methods, validated on simulation, phantom, and in vivo data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is adaptable, efficient, and effective for CPWC denoising without paired data or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in MICCAI 2024, with a 10% improvement in GREEN score. Found LLM size independence under same training, volume size trade-offs, and segmentation mask benefits.

Conclusion: 3D MLLMs are effective for RRG, with design choices like segmentation masks and knowledge-based augmentation significantly improving performance. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input
representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning
techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLM-based agents can handle contextual privacy in real-life, high-stakes scenarios where privacy is critical.

Method: Introduces the MAGPIE benchmark with 158 scenarios across 15 domains, evaluating LLMs on privacy understanding and collaboration without violating privacy.

Result: Current models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-2.7-Sonnet) often misclassify private data and disclose it in multi-turn conversations, failing in 71% of tasks.

Conclusion: Existing LLM-based agents lack robust contextual privacy understanding and collaborative task-solving alignment.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Result: Achieves over 20% improvement on the new dataset and a 70% win rate against baselines on safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for developing safer language model agents.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities, moving beyond shallow reasoning to human-like (level-2) reasoning.

Method: Analyzes transformer-based LLMs' autoregression mechanism, introduces CausalProbe-2024 benchmark, and proposes G^2-Reasoner for improved reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform poorly on CausalProbe-2024, confirming level-1 reasoning. G^2-Reasoner significantly improves performance in fresh and counterfactual contexts.

Conclusion: G^2-Reasoner advances LLMs toward genuine causal reasoning, bridging the gap between level-1 and level-2 capabilities.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

Result: Accuracy improved from 37.8% to 60.8% with 'map-then-reason', and further to 70.7% with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Scaffolding spatial mental models with structured representations and flexible reasoning enhances VLMs' understanding of unobservable space.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mind2Web 2 introduces a benchmark for evaluating agentic search systems, proposing an Agent-as-a-Judge framework to assess complex, time-varying answers. It evaluates nine systems, with OpenAI Deep Research achieving 50-70% of human performance in half the time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to address the complexity and open-endedness of agentic search systems, necessitating a new evaluation framework.

Method: Developed Mind2Web 2 with 130 realistic tasks and proposed an Agent-as-a-Judge framework using task-specific judge agents and a tree-structured rubric.

Result: OpenAI Deep Research performs at 50-70% of human efficiency in half the time.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for future agentic search system development and benchmarking.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

### [183] [Automatic Reviewers Assignment to a Research Paper Based on Allied References and Publications Weight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21331)
*Tamim Al Mahmud,B M Mainul Hossain,Dilshad Ara*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: A program is proposed to automatically select the best reviewers for research papers by analyzing references, extracting keywords, and ranking authors based on research metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of efficiently selecting expert reviewers for the growing volume of research papers across emerging fields.

Method: Collect references from papers, extract research keywords, rank authors by metrics (h-index, i10-index, citations), and filter top candidates.

Result: A ranked list of potential reviewers, typically professors, is generated for efficient peer review assignment.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a systematic and automated solution to the reviewer selection problem in peer review.

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences,
anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various
periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to
review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are
called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee
for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and
the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these
papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts
in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should
be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the
best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy
to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research
paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we
collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the
references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic
keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count
their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we
rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their
homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and
colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,
generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research
paper.

### [184] [Model-Based Real-Time Pose and Sag Estimation of Overhead Power Lines Using LiDAR for Drone Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20812)
*Alexandre Girard,Steven A. Parkison,Philippe Hamelin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for drone-based power line inspection using LiDAR, focusing on a single geometric model to improve accuracy and efficiency despite challenges like minimal conductor points and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drones simplify power line inspections, but LiDAR-based localization faces challenges like sparse conductor points, inconsistent detection, and difficulty distinguishing conductors from other objects.

Method: Proposes an estimation approach minimizing error between LiDAR measurements and a single geometric model of the entire conductor array, avoiding separate tracking of individual conductors.

Result: Achieves accurate tracking with solver convergence under 50 ms per frame, tolerating partial observations, noise, and outliers. Sensitivity analysis shows resilience to twice as many outlier points as valid measurements.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses LiDAR-based drone localization challenges for power line inspections, offering robust performance in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

*Shruti Bansal,Wenshan Wang,Yifei Liu,Parv Maheshwari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using synthetic thermal data to address the lack of thermal imagery in multi-modal datasets for robotics, leveraging conditional diffusion models to convert RGB images to thermal images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras are valuable in degraded environments but lack sufficient data for robotics applications, hindering their adaptation.

Method: The paper uses conditional diffusion models with self-attention to learn thermal properties and convert RGB images to synthetic thermal images.

Result: The proposed method enables the augmentation of existing datasets with synthetic thermal data, facilitating thermal camera adoption.

Conclusion: Synthetic thermal data generation can bridge the gap in thermal imagery availability, accelerating the use of thermal cameras in robotics.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

*Junwei You,Pei Li,Zhuoyu Jiang,Zilin Huang,Rui Gan,Haotian Shi,Bin Ran*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: V2X-REALM is a vision-language model framework for robust cooperative autonomous driving in long-tail scenarios, featuring adaptive multimodal learning and outperforming baselines in complex conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust planning and decision-making in rare, diverse, and visually degraded long-tail scenarios for autonomous driving, especially in cooperative settings.

Method: Proposes V2X-REALM with three innovations: prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation, gated multi-scenario adaptive attention, and multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex driving conditions.

Conclusion: Advances the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving by effectively handling long-tail scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.
