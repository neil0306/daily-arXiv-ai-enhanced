To address this\nquestion, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ\nfrom BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists\nincluding random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving\ndeletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not\ndepend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or\nexactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like\naccuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation\nreveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant\ndegradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free\ninference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is\noften much smaller than expected.

As reasoning capabilities and deep\nresearch methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI\nagents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset\nthat meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven\ndata curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark\nevaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208\nreal-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.\nOur tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced\ndeep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging\nDatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities\nand perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental\ndichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,\nwhile synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured\ngeneration-yet both catastrophically fail on \"corner cases\" outside existing\ndistributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset\ndiscovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding\nany dataset in the digital universe.

To compensate for the deficiency of\nrobot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with\nlarge-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from\nrobotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future\nframes at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under\ninsufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale\nhuman action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions\nfrom hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical\nReasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action\nvideos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,\nenabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human\nhand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm\nin imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human\naction videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar\nhistorical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map\nbetween human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing\non action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves\nleading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}.

However, mainstream AutoDA methods often\nencounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively\ntime-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is\nsuboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address\nthese issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,\nsearch-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while\nmaintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic\nscoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,\nenabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.\nAdditionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the\npotential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA\nnarrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA\nmethods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\\% on ImageNet\nwith ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing\naugmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without\nrequiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also\nenhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a\npromising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs\napplicable to a variety of future tasks.

Current deep learning methods, despite their\neffectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them\nimpractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA\n(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient\nsemantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through\ncompositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional\nconvolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a\nparameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging\nlow-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized\nfeature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect\nanalysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature\nrepresentation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ninfrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive\nor superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while\nusing significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).\nOperating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for\nreal-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection\nsystems without compromising accuracy.
