However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability\nunder strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under\nstricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.\nWhile ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle\nwith stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is\nformed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,\ncapturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor\nfor knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed\nperiodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task\nconsistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation\nmechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and\npreserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a\nresult, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining\npreviously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and\nplasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that\nour method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models\nacross various memory budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel approach using a Global Workspace Model (GWM) and multi-level collaborative distillation improves stability and adaptability in Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) under strict memory constraints.", "motivation": "OCIL faces challenges in maintaining model stability and adaptability under strict memory constraints, where current methods (replay-based or ensemble) fall short.", "method": "Proposes a GWM to fuse student model parameters, capturing historical learning, and a multi-level distillation mechanism for peer-to-peer consistency and knowledge alignment.", "result": "Significant performance improvement on three OCIL benchmarks across various memory budgets.", "conclusion": "The method balances stability and plasticity, enhancing OCIL model performance under memory constraints."}}
