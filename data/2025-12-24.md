*Shashi Kant Gupta,Arijeet Pramanik,Jerrin John Thomas,Regina Schwind,Lauren Wiener,Avi Raju,Jeremy Kornbluth,Yanshan Wang,Zhaohui Su,Hrituraj Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based agentic framework achieves high accuracy (F1=0.93) for extracting structured oncology data from 400K+ unstructured EHR notes, significantly reducing manual annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured EHR notes contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment and research, but manual abstraction is costly and existing automated approaches are too narrow - they don't handle patient-level synthesis across contradictory documents or the extensive variability in oncology terminology and formats.

Method: Proposes an agentic framework using LLMs as reasoning agents with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities. Systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks to extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes.

Result: Achieved average F1-score of 0.93 on 400,000+ unstructured notes and PDF reports from 2,250 cancer patients. 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeded F1=0.85, with critical variables (biomarkers, medications) surpassing 0.95. Integration into workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs.

Conclusion: This is the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale, demonstrating that agentic frameworks can effectively handle the complexity and variability of real-world clinical data extraction.

Abstract: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

### [2] [How well do Large Language Models Recognize Instructional Moves? Establishing Baselines for Foundation Models in Educational Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19903)
*Kirk Vanacore,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show moderate baseline performance for classifying instructional moves in classroom transcripts, with few-shot prompting significantly improving results but not eliminating reliability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly adopted in educational technologies, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities for interpreting authentic educational scenarios is crucial for setting expectations and benchmarking, especially since prior work has focused on customized models rather than baseline performance.

Method: Compared six LLMs on classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts using typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, evaluating performance against expert-coded annotations using Cohen's Kappa.

Result: Zero-shot performance was moderate, but few-shot prompting significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58. However, performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at increased false positives.

Conclusion: Foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

### [3] [Counterfactual LLM-based Framework for Measuring Rhetorical Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19908)
*Jingyi Qiu,Hong Chen,Zongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based framework quantifies rhetorical style in ML papers, finding visionary framing predicts attention and post-2023 rise driven by LLM writing assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to distinguish between substantive content and rhetorical style ("hype") in ML papers, as bold language could reflect either strong results or mere style.

Method: Counterfactual LLM framework: multiple LLM personas generate alternative writings from same content, LLM judge compares via pairwise evaluations, aggregated using Bradley-Terry model. Applied to 8,485 ICLR submissions (2017-2025).

Result: Visionary framing predicts downstream attention (citations/media) even after controlling for peer-review. Sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, driven by LLM writing assistance. Framework validated by robustness to personas and high LLM-human correlation.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation by quantifying rhetorical style independently of content.

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

### [4] [PRISM: A Personality-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Social Media Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19933)
*Zhixiang Lu,Xueyuan Deng,Yiran Liu,Yulong Li,Qiang Yan,Imran Razzak,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a hybrid agent-based model combining SDEs for emotions with personality-conditional POMDPs for decisions, using MBTI-based policies for MLLM agents to better capture psychological heterogeneity in online polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ABMs fail to capture psychological heterogeneity driving online polarization due to simplistic homogeneity assumptions, obscuring the interplay between cognitive biases and information propagation.

Method: Hybrid framework coupling stochastic differential equations for continuous emotional evolution with personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision process for discrete decision-making, using MBTI-based cognitive policies for MLLM agents initialized via data-driven priors from social media datasets.

Result: Achieves superior personality consistency aligned with human ground truth, significantly outperforming standard homogeneous and Big Five benchmarks, and effectively replicates emergent phenomena like rational suppression and affective resonance.

Conclusion: PRISM offers a robust tool for analyzing complex social media ecosystems by better capturing psychological heterogeneity in opinion dynamics.

Abstract: Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) of opinion dynamics often fail to capture the psychological heterogeneity driving online polarization due to simplistic homogeneity assumptions. This limitation obscures the critical interplay between individual cognitive biases and information propagation, thereby hindering a mechanistic understanding of how ideological divides are amplified. To address this challenge, we introduce the Personality-Refracted Intelligent Simulation Model (PRISM), a hybrid framework coupling stochastic differential equations (SDE) for continuous emotional evolution with a personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision process (PC-POMDP) for discrete decision-making. In contrast to continuous trait approaches, PRISM assigns distinct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based cognitive policies to multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, initialized via data-driven priors from large-scale social media datasets. PRISM achieves superior personality consistency aligned with human ground truth, significantly outperforming standard homogeneous and Big Five benchmarks. This framework effectively replicates emergent phenomena such as rational suppression and affective resonance, offering a robust tool for analyzing complex social media ecosystems.

### [5] [Bias Beneath the Tone: Empirical Characterisation of Tone Bias in LLM-Driven UX Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19950)
*Heet Bodara,Md Masum Mushfiq,Isma Farah Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates tone bias in large language models used in conversational AI, showing that even neutral prompts produce systematic tonal skew, and develops classification methods to detect these biases with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in conversational systems often exhibit subtle tone biases (overly polite, cheerful, cautious) even when neutrality is expected, which can influence user perceptions of trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue.

Method: Created two synthetic dialogue datasets (neutral prompts vs. explicitly guided positive/negative tones), used weak supervision with pretrained DistilBERT for tone labeling, and trained multiple classifiers including ensemble models to detect tone patterns.

Result: Even neutral prompts showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting bias stems from models' underlying conversational style. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, demonstrating tone bias is systematic and measurable.

Conclusion: Tone bias is a hidden behavioral trait in LLMs that is systematic, measurable, and relevant for designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

### [6] [Schoenfeld's Anatomy of Mathematical Reasoning by Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19995)
*Ming Li,Chenrui Fan,Yize Cheng,Soheil Feizi,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkARM framework abstracts LLM reasoning traces into functional steps (Analyze, Explore, Implement, Verify) using Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, revealing reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences in mathematical problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current analysis of LLM reasoning traces is limited to surface-level statistics, making it difficult to identify and analyze the underlying cognitive structure and steps beyond token-level views.

Method: Introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps based on Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models.

Result: Reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models; shows exploration functions as critical branching step associated with correctness; efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses.

Conclusion: Episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

### [7] [Memory-T1: Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Reasoning in Multi-session Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20092)
*Yiming Du,Baojun Wang,Yifan Xiang,Zhaowei Wang,Wenyu Huang,Boyang Xue,Bin Liang,Xingshan Zeng,Fei Mi,Haoli Bai,Lifeng Shang,Jeff Z. Pan,Yuxin Jiang,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Memory-T1 is a reinforcement learning framework that learns time-aware memory selection for temporal reasoning in long multi-session dialogues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Time-Dialog benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context models struggle with temporal reasoning in lengthy, noisy dialogue histories, impairing their ability to identify temporally pertinent information for accurate reasoning.

Method: Uses RL with coarse-to-fine strategy: first prunes dialogue history using temporal and relevance filters, then RL agent selects precise evidence sessions guided by multi-level reward function optimizing answer accuracy, evidence grounding, and temporal consistency.

Result: Achieves 67.0% overall score on Time-Dialog benchmark (new SOTA for open-source models), outperforms 14B baseline by 10.2%, maintains robustness up to 128k tokens where baselines collapse, with temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards contributing 15.0% performance gain.

Conclusion: Memory-T1 effectively addresses temporal reasoning challenges in long dialogues through time-aware memory selection, demonstrating superior performance and robustness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

### [8] [A Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20097)
*Zuo Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextGSL is a novel graph-sequence learning model for inductive text classification that combines multi-edge graph neural networks with Transformer layers to capture both diverse structural relationships and sequential information in text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based text classification methods have two major limitations: 1) they fail to fully consider diverse structural information across word pairs (co-occurrence, syntax, semantics), and 2) they neglect sequence information in text graph structure learning and cannot handle texts with new words and relations (inductive setting).

Method: TextGSL constructs a single text-level graph for each text with different edge types based on diverse word-pair relationships. It uses an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information and incorporates Transformer layers to capture sequential information, enabling inductive learning.

Result: Experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets show that TextGSL outperforms several strong baselines in terms of accuracy.

Conclusion: TextGSL effectively addresses limitations of existing GNN-based text classification by jointly modeling diverse structural relationships and sequential information, achieving superior performance for inductive text classification tasks.

Abstract: Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.

### [9] [ABBEL: LLM Agents Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20111)
*Aly Lidayan,Jakob Bjorner,Satvik Golechha,Kartik Goyal,Alane Suhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ABBEL framework enables LLM agents to maintain concise contexts via natural language belief states instead of full interaction histories, with RL post-training improving performance beyond full-context approaches while using less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As sequential decision-making tasks grow longer, keeping full interaction histories becomes computationally impractical due to context length limitations. There's a need for methods that maintain concise contexts while preserving task performance.

Method: ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history with a natural language belief state summarizing task-relevant unknowns. At each step, the agent updates prior belief with new observations to form posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select actions. RL post-training with belief grading (rewarding quality) and length penalties (rewarding compression) further improves performance.

Result: ABBEL maintains near-constant memory use over interaction steps while generating interpretable beliefs. However, initial ABBEL suffers from error propagation causing inferior performance compared to full context. RL-trained ABBEL agents outperform full context setting while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches across six diverse multi-step environments.

Conclusion: ABBEL provides a practical framework for LLM agents to handle long sequential tasks with interpretable belief states and constant memory usage. RL post-training effectively addresses error propagation issues, enabling performance improvements beyond full-context approaches while maintaining memory efficiency.

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M³KG-RAG enhances multimodal RAG by constructing multi-hop multimodal knowledge graphs and using GRASP for precise retrieval and pruning, improving audio-visual reasoning in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal RAG systems face challenges in audio-visual domains due to limited modality coverage and connectivity in existing multimodal knowledge graphs, and similarity-based retrieval that fails to filter irrelevant or redundant knowledge.

Method: Proposes M³KG-RAG with two key components: 1) A lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop multimodal knowledge graphs (M³KG) with context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, and 2) GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning) for precise entity grounding, relevance evaluation, and pruning of redundant context.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M³KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: M³KG-RAG effectively addresses limitations in multimodal RAG by enabling modality-wise retrieval from multi-hop knowledge graphs and ensuring precise, relevant knowledge selection, leading to improved reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in audio-visual domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.

TL;DR: EKA (Early Knowledge Alignment) improves iterative RAG systems by aligning LLMs with retrieval corpus before planning, reducing cascading errors and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative RAG systems plan question decomposition without considering the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and cascading errors in multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Introduces Early Knowledge Alignment module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning, providing contextually relevant knowledge to establish stronger reasoning foundation.

Result: Significant improvements in retrieval precision, reduced cascading errors, enhanced performance and efficiency across six standard RAG datasets; reduces unnecessary exploration during reasoning.

Conclusion: EKA advances state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems, demonstrating critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

TL;DR: RetroPrompt is a novel prompt learning approach that balances memorization and generalization by using retrieval mechanisms from a knowledge base, outperforming traditional methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios across NLP and CV tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prompt learning for pre-trained foundation models follows parametric learning paradigms that can compromise generalization stability, struggle with atypical instances, and overfit to shallow patterns with limited data during supervised training.

Method: RetroPrompt decouples knowledge from memorization by leveraging a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from training data and incorporating retrieval mechanisms throughout input, training, and inference stages, enabling active retrieval of relevant contextual information.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across various NLP and computer vision datasets demonstrate RetroPrompt's superior performance in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to traditional prompting methods.

Conclusion: RetroPrompt effectively reduces reliance on rote memorization and enhances generalization by balancing memorization and generalization through retrieval-based knowledge utilization, making it a promising approach for few-shot learning with foundation models.

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

TL;DR: Fun-Audio-Chat is a Large Audio Language Model that addresses temporal resolution mismatch and catastrophic forgetting in joint speech-text models through dual-resolution processing and core-cocktail training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint speech-text models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge.

Method: 1. Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz via token grouping, while Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz. 2. Core-Cocktail Training: Two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. 3. Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy.

Result: Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They show competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy.

Conclusion: Fun-Audio-Chat successfully addresses key limitations of existing models by balancing efficiency and quality while retaining text LLM knowledge, achieving strong performance across multiple audio-language tasks without requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

### [14] [AI Security Beyond Core Domains: Resume Screening as a Case Study of Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Specialized LLM Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20164)
*Honglin Mu,Jinghao Liu,Kaiyang Wan,Rui Xing,Xiuying Chen,Timothy Baldwin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial instructions hidden in inputs like resumes, with over 80% attack success. The paper introduces a benchmark for resume screening vulnerability and proposes FIDS defense using LoRA adaptation, showing training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used for automated tasks like resume screening, but they can be manipulated by adversarial instructions hidden in input data, causing them to deviate from intended tasks. While defenses exist for mature domains like code review, they are often absent in other common applications like resume screening and peer review.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark to assess LLM vulnerability in resume screening. It evaluates two defense mechanisms: 1) prompt-based defenses, and 2) FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation. The combined approach is also tested.

Result: Attack success rates exceed 80% for certain attack types in resume screening. Prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase. FIDS achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction.

Conclusion: Training-time defenses (like FIDS with LoRA adaptation) outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation. The vulnerability to adversarial instructions is significant in applications like resume screening, and effective defenses require training-time approaches rather than just prompt engineering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text comprehension and generation, making them ideal for automated tasks like code review and content moderation. However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.

Conclusion: FaithLens provides a cost-efficient and effective solution for faithfulness hallucination detection with explanations, improving trustworthiness in LLM applications while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for realistic evaluation corpora to assess automatic systems for facilitating meetings between people without a common language, enabled by speech translation technology.

Method: Created a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues with ASR transcripts in 12 languages and English translations, plus written summaries. Proposed automatic misunderstanding detection using large language models (tested Gemini) and manual annotation for comparison.

Result: The Gemini model achieved 77% recall and 47% precision in identifying text spans containing misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings.

Conclusion: The presented corpus enables research in cross-lingual meeting facilitation and summarization, while demonstrating that current LLMs like Gemini can detect misunderstandings with reasonable recall but moderate precision.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

*Wenzheng Zeng,Mingyu Ouyang,Langyuan Cui,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlideTailor: A framework for generating personalized presentation slides by learning user preferences from example paper-slide pairs and visual templates, with chain-of-speech mechanism for oral narration alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic slide generation systems produce suboptimal results because they don't account for individual user preferences, which vary significantly. Current approaches are under-specified and fail to align with specific user needs.

Method: SlideTailor uses a human behavior-inspired agentic framework that progressively generates editable slides. It learns user preferences from easy-to-provide artifacts: a paper-slides example pair and a visual template. The framework includes a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration.

Result: The framework effectively distills and generalizes implicit user preferences despite unlabeled inputs. It significantly enhances slide quality and enables downstream applications like video presentations. A benchmark dataset with interpretable metrics was created for evaluation.

Conclusion: SlideTailor successfully addresses personalized slide generation by learning from natural user-provided artifacts, overcoming limitations of existing under-specified approaches and enabling better alignment with individual user needs.

Abstract: Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against unsafe or adversarial behavior is critical as they are increasingly deployed in conversational and agentic settings. Existing moderation tools often treat safety risks (e.g. toxicity, bias) and adversarial threats (e.g. prompt injections, jailbreaks) as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability. We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios. By releasing the model, we aim to advance transparent and reproducible research on reliable safeguards for LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform mental health professionals in diagnosing personality disorders from Polish autobiographical narratives, but show significant bias against diagnosing narcissistic personality disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives for psychiatric diagnosis compared to human professionals, addressing growing reliance on AI for mental health assessment.

Method: Direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals using Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts to diagnose Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders.

Result: Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals by 21.91 percentage points in overall accuracy (65.48% vs 43.57%). Models excelled at BPD diagnosis (F1=83.4 vs 80.0) but severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1=6.7 vs 50.0), showing reluctance toward the term "narcissism." Models provided confident, elaborate justifications while humans were concise and cautious.

Conclusion: LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex clinical data but suffer from critical reliability and bias issues, particularly value-laden judgments like narcissism diagnosis.

Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.

TL;DR: SpidR is a self-supervised speech representation model that learns phonetic-rich representations for textless spoken language modeling, outperforming existing models on language benchmarks while reducing pretraining time from a week to one day.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates by extracting semantic representations from speech, addressing the need for efficient textless spoken language modeling.

Method: Self-supervised model trained on raw waveforms using masked prediction objective with self-distillation and online clustering; intermediate student layers predict teacher layer assignments, stabilizing clustering for higher-quality codebooks.

Result: Outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC); validates correlation between speech unit quality metrics (ABX, PNMI) and LM performance; reduces pretraining time from a week to one day on 16 GPUs.

Conclusion: SpidR provides an efficient, high-quality speech representation model for textless spoken language modeling with significantly reduced training time, enabling faster experimentation and advancing speech-based language learning.

Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BanglaRiddleEval is a new benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles across four tasks, showing current LLMs perform poorly (max 56% MCQ accuracy vs 83% human baseline) on figurative reasoning in low-resource Bangla.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' reasoning ability in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings like Bangla remains underexplored, creating a gap in understanding their capabilities for non-English, culturally-specific figurative language.

Method: Created BanglaRiddleEval benchmark with 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles across four tasks (4,976 artifacts). Used LLM-based pipeline to generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, distractors, and ambiguity annotations. Evaluated diverse open-source and closed-source models with different prompting strategies.

Result: Models show moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness. MCQ accuracy peaks at only ~56% vs 83% human baseline. Ambiguity resolution ranges from ~26% to 68%. High-quality explanations only from strongest models.

Conclusion: Current LLMs capture some cues for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance. BanglaRiddleEval establishes a challenging benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning, with all resources publicly available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

Abstract: Qualitative research faces a critical reliability challenge: traditional inter-rater agreement methods require multiple human coders, are time-intensive, and often yield moderate consistency. We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($κ$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($κ= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($κ= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($κ= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($κ> 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes. Our open-source implementation provides researchers with transparent reliability metrics, flexible configuration, and structure-agnostic consensus extraction, establishing methodological foundations for reliable AI-assisted qualitative research.

Abstract: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

TL;DR: Simple recipe for selecting which transformer layers to convert from softmax to linear attention using importance scores from minimal training, combined with RADLADS distillation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM inference efficiency by distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into hybrid architectures without expensive pretraining, requiring effective layer selection methods.

Method: Uses layer importance scores derived from small training on generic text data for layer selection, then applies RADLADS distillation pipeline (attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, and fine-tuning).

Result: More effective than existing approaches including uniform interleaving heuristics and specialized diagnostic dataset methods.

Conclusion: Simple importance-based layer selection with generic text training provides effective hybrid architecture conversion for improved LLM inference efficiency.

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

### [26] [Can LLMs Predict Their Own Failures? Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20578)
*Amirhosein Ghasemabadi,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gnosis enables LLMs to self-verify correctness by analyzing internal states during inference, adding minimal parameters and achieving better accuracy than external judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches require external judges or multi-sample consistency, which are computationally expensive and weakly correlated with true correctness.

Method: Gnosis is a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. It passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost.

Result: Across math reasoning, open-domain QA, and academic knowledge benchmarks (with frozen backbones from 1.7B to 20B parameters), Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. It also generalizes zero-shot to partial generations for early failure detection.

Conclusion: Reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to the generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision, enabling LLMs to self-verify with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

### [27] [Cube Bench: A Benchmark for Spatial Visual Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20595)
*Dhruv Anand,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cube Bench is a Rubik's Cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal LLMs, testing five core skills across varying scramble depths, revealing performance gaps between closed and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for a standardized benchmark to evaluate spatial and sequential reasoning capabilities in multimodal LLMs, particularly for complex tasks requiring both perception and multi-step planning like solving Rubik's Cubes.

Method: Created Cube Bench with five skill tests: face reconstruction, optimal move selection, move outcome prediction, multi-step plan execution with recovery, and error detection/revision. Used shared scrambled cube states, identical prompts/parsers, and distance-to-solved metric across seven MLLMs at varying scramble depths.

Result: Accuracy drops sharply with scramble depth; models rarely recover from stalled/diverged trajectories. Strong closed-source models outperform open-weight models, which cluster near chance on hardest settings. Self-correction yields modest gains but can cause overthinking. Face reconstruction accuracy doesn't guarantee competent action selection.

Conclusion: Cube Bench provides a compact, reproducible probe for evaluating sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current models, especially as task complexity increases.

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

### [29] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM is a novel physical adversarial attack framework using anamorphic art to create perspective-dependent adversarial examples that fool object detectors in connected autonomous vehicles, causing both individual vehicle deception and network-wide disruption through V2X communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected autonomous vehicles rely on vision-based DNNs and V2X communication, but remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. Current attacks often require model access or lack transferability across different detector architectures.

Method: PHANTOM uses anamorphic art techniques to craft perspective-dependent adversarial examples that appear natural to humans but are misclassified by object detectors. It operates in black-box settings without model access and exploits geometric distortions. The framework was evaluated across four detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet) in CARLA simulator under varying conditions.

Result: Achieves over 90% attack success rate under optimal conditions, maintains 60-80% effectiveness in degraded environments. Attack activates within 6-10 meters of target. In network simulations, false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89% and degrading safety-critical communication.

Conclusion: PHANTOM exposes critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems, demonstrating that perspective-dependent adversarial attacks can effectively deceive multiple vehicle detectors and cause network-wide disruption with insufficient time for safe maneuvering.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

*SaiKiran Tedla,Kelly Zhu,Trevor Canham,Felix Taubner,Michael S. Brown,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new technique uses pre-trained video diffusion models to recover complex scene dynamics from motion-blurred images, revealing what happened before, during, and after image capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion-blurred images contain valuable information about scene and camera motion during exposure, but existing methods rely on handcrafted priors and struggle with complex dynamics, failing to recover events before or after image capture.

Method: Repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos showing scene dynamics during capture and what might have occurred immediately before or after.

Result: Outperforms previous methods, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks like recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that motion blur can reveal rich information about scene dynamics when leveraging large-scale video priors, enabling robust recovery of complex temporal information from single blurry images.

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

TL;DR: A method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models that generates focal stacks from single defocused images, enabling interactive focus adjustment after capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autofocus systems often fail to capture intended subjects, and users frequently want to adjust focus after taking photos, creating a need for post-capture refocusing capabilities.

Method: Uses video diffusion models to generate perceptually accurate focal stacks (represented as video sequences) from single defocused images, enabling interactive refocusing.

### [32] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits scoring functions for geometric model fitting in RANSAC, analyzes MAGSAC++ showing it's equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform model, and finds all scoring functions perform similarly in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine the state-of-the-art in scoring functions for robust geometric model fitting, particularly analyzing MAGSAC++ which claims superior performance but may have flawed theoretical foundations.

Method: 1) Extends geometric error to spherical noises and develops unified framework for likelihood-based and robust M-estimators; 2) Analyzes MAGSAC++ derivation and shows numerical equivalence to simple Gaussian-uniform model; 3) Proposes experimental methodology using large or small random validation sets to evaluate scoring functions.

Result: MAGSAC++ derivation lacks sound principles and is numerically equivalent to basic Gaussian-uniform likelihood. All scoring functions (including learned distributions) perform identically in experiments. MAGSAC++ is neither better performing nor less sensitive to threshold hyperparameter than simpler alternatives.

Conclusion: The comprehensive analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art scoring functions don't offer performance advantages over simpler models, challenging existing benchmarks and providing critical insights for future research in robust geometric fitting.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ introduces a hybrid view-transformation framework with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to improve geometric consistency and boundary awareness for 3D panoptic occupancy prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D panoptic occupancy prediction methods struggle with maintaining precise geometry and capturing accurate spatial ranges of 3D instances, which is critical for robust panoptic separation in complex environments.

Method: HyGE-Occ uses a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with discretized depth-bin formulation to produce geometrically consistent BEV features. It also extracts edge maps from BEV features as auxiliary information to learn edge cues for better boundary awareness.

Result: On the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach with Gaussian and edge priors effectively enhances both geometric consistency and boundary awareness, leading to improved performance in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction tasks.

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Widget2Code: A new benchmark and baseline for generating code from widget images, addressing unique challenges of compact, context-free micro-interfaces with proprietary designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior UI2Code work focuses on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces with dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints, and lack accessible markup data unlike web/mobile UIs.

Method: Introduces Widget2Code benchmark with fine-grained metrics. Develops baseline with perceptual understanding (atomic component assembly, icon retrieval, visualization modules) and structured code generation via WidgetFactory infrastructure including WidgetDSL (framework-agnostic domain-specific language) and compiler for multiple front-end implementations with adaptive rendering for spatial refinement.

Result: Generalized MLLMs outperform specialized UI2Code methods but still produce unreliable/visually inconsistent code. The proposed baseline substantially enhances visual fidelity, establishing strong foundation for future Widget2Code research.

Conclusion: Widget2Code addresses unique widget challenges with a comprehensive benchmark and baseline infrastructure that advances both perceptual understanding and structured code generation, providing unified framework for future research in this underexplored domain.

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign: A deep learning framework for joint cortical and subcortical brain MRI registration using unified volume-and-surface representation via spherical coordinate space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional brain MRI registration methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, leading to inconsistencies that limit downstream neuroscientific analyses. There's a need for a unified approach that aligns both cortical and subcortical regions consistently.

Method: NeurAlign uses a deep learning framework with an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy. It integrates spherical registration into learning to ensure geometric coherence between volume and surface domains, requiring only an MRI scan as input.

Result: Outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods, improving Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Orders of magnitude faster than standard methods and simpler to use with no additional inputs beyond MRI scan.

Conclusion: NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration with superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, enabling more consistent and anatomically accurate brain MRI alignment for neuroscientific studies.

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2 is a vehicle-centric pre-trained large model that incorporates multimodal structured priors (symmetry, contour, semantics) into masked token reconstruction to learn better vehicle perception representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations needed for applications like surveillance, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes VehicleMAE-V2 with three key modules: Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM) uses vehicle symmetry constraints to select high-quality masked patches; Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) preserves holistic vehicle structure through distribution alignment; Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) addresses feature confusion via image-text contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation.

Result: Constructed Autobot4M dataset with ~4M vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

Conclusion: VehicleMAE-V2 effectively incorporates vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to enhance learning of generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception, outperforming existing approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers exhibit block-recurrent depth structure where computation can be approximated using far fewer distinct blocks applied recurrently, enabling dynamical systems analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a mechanistic account of Vision Transformers' computational phenomenology by interpreting their depth as a well-characterized dynamical flow, since current frameworks lack this perspective despite architectural cues suggesting dynamical structure.

Method: Introduced Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH) and trained Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor) - block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs that use k << L distinct blocks applied recurrently. Analyzed between-layer representational similarity matrices and trained Raptor models to recover original model performance.

Result: Demonstrated that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure. Trained a Raptor model achieving 96% of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy with only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Found directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins, token-specific dynamics, and collapse to low rank updates in late depth.

Conclusion: A compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, revealing a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis, with implications for interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods produce implausible results when applied to 360° panoramas in both equirectangular projections and perspective views, creating a need for specialized solutions for panoramic editing.

Method: Proposes SE360 with: 1) Coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline using Vision-Language Model and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis; 2) Two-stage data refinement strategy to improve realism and reduce overfitting; 3) Transformer-based diffusion model trained on the constructed dataset for flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image.

Result: The method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy for 360° panorama editing, producing semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent results.

Conclusion: SE360 provides an effective framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360° panoramas, addressing the unique challenges of panoramic editing through autonomous data generation and specialized model training.

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether global 3D understanding naturally emerges in Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) trained on large-scale 2D video data, and to quantify their 3D awareness capabilities.

Method: Proposed a model-agnostic framework that measures 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs (simple classifiers/probes).

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models exhibit strong 3D understanding of objects and scenes despite no 3D training, sometimes surpassing specialized 3D models. The study provides comprehensive 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs.

Conclusion: Video Foundation Models can develop significant 3D understanding from 2D video data alone, offering valuable insights for building scalable 3D models without requiring explicit 3D supervision.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS is a computational framework that links tissue spatial organization in whole slide images to clinical outcomes using topological/spatial features and mass univariate regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for analyzing whole slide images lack the ability to measure spatial interactions of tissue characteristics and their association with clinical parameters, limiting clinical relevance of pathomic analysis.

Method: HistoWAS implements: (1) a feature space with 30 topological/spatial features adapted from GIS point pattern analysis to quantify tissue micro-architecture, and (2) an association study engine performing mass univariate regression with statistical correction, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies.

Result: Applied HistoWAS to 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 KPMP participants, analyzing 102 features (72 conventional + 30 spatial features). Code and data released publicly.

Conclusion: HistoWAS addresses limitations in current pathomic analysis by providing a framework to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes, enabling biomarker discovery and tissue characteristic studies.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WSD-MIL: A window scale decay MIL framework for computational pathology that efficiently models tumor regions at varying scales while reducing computational memory by 62%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods in computational pathology overlook complex semantic relationships among instances in WSIs. Transformer-based approaches have quadratic complexity limiting scalability, and fixed-scale attention mechanisms struggle with varying tumor region scales and distance-based decay effects.

Method: Proposes WSD-MIL with two key modules: 1) Window scale decay attention module using cluster-based sampling to reduce computation while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; 2) Squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module to dynamically adjust window weights for better global information modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing computational memory by 62% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: WSD-MIL effectively addresses computational efficiency and scale variation challenges in computational pathology MIL, providing an efficient solution for modeling tumor regions at varying scales while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDTM: A dual-branch weakly supervised framework for cross-resolution land cover mapping that decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning using diffusion and transformer branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-resolution land cover mapping suffers from severe resolution mismatch between coarse supervision and fine-grained predictions, leading to noisy supervision and degraded accuracy. Existing weakly supervised approaches struggle to align fine spatial structures with coarse labels.

Method: DDTM introduces a dual-branch framework: 1) diffusion-based branch for progressive fine-scale local semantic refinement under coarse supervision, 2) transformer-based branch for long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents, plus a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise and selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals.

Result: DDTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chesapeake Bay benchmark with 66.52% mIoU, substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Conclusion: DDTM effectively addresses cross-resolution land cover mapping challenges by decoupling local refinement from global reasoning, demonstrating superior performance through its dual-branch architecture and noise mitigation strategy.

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: MIVA is a lightweight modular adapter system for diffusion models that enables precise motion control for image animation using minimal training data, allowing users to select specific motion patterns without prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with image animation due to video data scarcity causing memorization over prompt compliance, and poor generalization to novel motion patterns. Fine-tuning DMs for new motions with limited data is challenging.

Method: Propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA) - lightweight sub-networks attachable to pre-trained DMs, each capturing a single motion pattern. MIVAs are scalable via parallelization and can be trained on ~10 samples using consumer-grade GPUs.

Result: MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining or surpassing generation quality of models trained on much larger datasets. Users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs without prompt engineering.

Conclusion: MIVA addresses key limitations of diffusion models for image animation by providing efficient, modular motion control with minimal training data, offering a practical solution for precise motion generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

TL;DR: LaSeRS is a new large-scale dataset for complex language-guided segmentation in remote sensing, addressing hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. SegEarth-R2 is a proposed MLLM architecture with spatial attention supervision and flexible segmentation queries that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing models fail at complex geospatial scenarios like multi-target segmentation, hierarchical granularity, and implicit intent interpretation. Existing datasets oversimplify tasks, leading to models that are sensitive and unreliable in real-world applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring.

Method: 1) Created LaSeRS dataset covering four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation. 2) Proposed SegEarth-R2 MLLM architecture with spatial attention supervision for small object localization and flexible segmentation query mechanism for single/multi-target scenarios.

Result: SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for next-generation geospatial segmentation. The model effectively handles complex segmentation tasks that previous models failed at.

Conclusion: LaSeRS addresses a critical gap in remote sensing datasets by capturing complex geospatial reasoning dimensions. SegEarth-R2's architecture with spatial attention supervision and flexible queries provides an effective solution for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-view (driver + road) distraction detection shows mixed results: SlowOnly improves 9.8% with dual-view, but SlowFast drops 7.2% due to representational conflicts, highlighting need for fusion-aware architecture design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing distracted driving detection models rely only on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. There's a need to investigate whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver footage improves detection accuracy in naturalistic conditions.

Method: Used synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving and benchmarked three spatiotemporal action recognition architectures (SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, SlowOnly-R50) under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view.

Result: Performance gains depend strongly on architecture: SlowOnly improved 9.8% with dual-view inputs, while SlowFast dropped 7.2% in accuracy due to representational conflicts. X3D-M results not specified but implied mixed performance.

Conclusion: Simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. Future multimodal driver monitoring systems need fusion-aware design.

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPI-GNN learns multifaceted graph profiles from disentangled feature subspaces for multimodal medical diagnosis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on diverse tasks with over 1300 patient samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural networks for medical diagnosis rely on single, static graphs built from indiscriminate features, which limits their ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships and compromises diagnostic efficacy.

Method: MAPI-GNN reconstructs the single-graph paradigm by learning multifaceted graph profiles from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. It uses a multi-dimensional discriminator to uncover latent graph-aware patterns, dynamically constructs a stack of activation graphs guided by these patterns, and aggregates them through a relational fusion engine for robust diagnosis.

Result: Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks with over 1300 patient samples demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN successfully addresses the limitations of single-graph approaches in medical diagnosis by learning multifaceted graph profiles from disentangled features, enabling better modeling of patient-specific pathological relationships and achieving superior diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Lin Li,Jiahui Li,Jiaming Lei,Jun Xiao,Feifei Shao,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2em introduces hyperbolic embeddings for compositional zero-shot learning, addressing limitations of Euclidean methods in modeling hierarchical structures through hyperbolic geometry with specialized loss functions and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CZSL methods fail to effectively model hierarchical structures (semantic hierarchy of primitives and conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions) in Euclidean space, which cannot scale to large-scale taxonomies due to polynomial volume growth mismatching exponential structure, impairing generalization.

Method: H2em learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings using hyperbolic geometry. It includes: 1) Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss using hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce predefined hierarchies, 2) Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to create large geodesic distances between similar compositions, and 3) Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention for instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry.

Result: Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry is well-suited for embedding hierarchical structures in CZSL, and H2em's specialized learning objectives effectively address hierarchical collapse and discrimination issues, leading to superior performance on benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin is a two-stage Mandarin lip-reading framework that combines visual features with phonetic context and LLM-based error correction to handle Mandarin's challenging homophones and ambiguous visemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin visual speech recognition is particularly challenging due to highly ambiguous visemes and prevalent homophones, requiring specialized approaches beyond English lip-reading methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Shared video encoder with dual decoders predicting both Chinese characters and Pinyin romanization; 2) LLM-based refinement using Pinyin output and candidate transcripts as prompts, with fine-tuning on synthetic noisy examples from intermediate checkpoints.

Result: The framework synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance by explicitly addressing homophone-induced errors through phonetic context and LLM-based correction.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin effectively extends English VALLR architecture to Mandarin by incorporating phonetic information (Pinyin) and leveraging LLMs for error correction, creating a robust solution for Mandarin visual speech recognition challenges.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

TL;DR: FlashLips is a real-time lip-sync system that achieves 100+ FPS on single GPU with high visual quality, using a two-stage mask-free approach combining deterministic reconstruction and audio control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lip-sync system that achieves real-time performance (100+ FPS) while maintaining high visual quality comparable to larger state-of-the-art models, without requiring explicit masks during inference.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 - compact one-step latent-space editor trained with reconstruction losses (no GANs/diffusion) using reference identity, masked target frame, and lips-pose vector; uses self-supervision with mouth-altered variants for mask-free inference. Stage 2 - audio-to-pose transformer with flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses from speech.

Result: Achieves real-time performance at over 100 FPS on a single GPU while matching visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models; provides simple, stable pipeline combining deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control.

Conclusion: FlashLips demonstrates that high-quality lip-sync can be achieved with real-time performance through a decoupled approach that separates lips control from rendering, using self-supervised learning to eliminate explicit masks and combining reconstruction-based editing with audio-driven pose prediction.

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal pipeline successfully addresses the gap in contextual image captioning by augmenting visual input with external textual knowledge, producing event-enriched, context-aware descriptions suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Motivation: While learned image codecs have been extended from human to machine perception, progressive compression with fine granular scalability (FGS) remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs.

Method: Proposes PICM-Net based on trit-plane coding. Analyzes differences between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities to determine latent prioritization strategies. Includes an adaptive decoding controller that dynamically determines necessary decoding level during inference to maintain desired confidence in downstream machine predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in downstream classification tasks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression that enables progressive transmission optimized for machine perception rather than human perception.

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

*Jinyoung Choi,Youngchae Kwon,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRSN improves fashion style classification by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations alongside global features, achieving significant accuracy gains across multiple backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion style classification is challenging due to large visual variation within styles and visual similarity between different styles. Styles are expressed through both global appearance and individual item attributes/combinations.

Method: Propose Item Region-based Style Network (IRSN) with: 1) Item Region Pooling (IRP) to extract features from each item region, 2) Separate analysis of item-specific features, 3) Gated Feature Fusion (GFF) to combine features, 4) Dual-backbone architecture combining domain-specific and general feature extractors pre-trained on large-scale image-text data.

Result: IRSN applied to six backbones (EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, etc.) improved style classification accuracy by average 6.9% (max 14.5%) on FashionStyle14 and average 7.6% (max 15.1%) on ShowniqV3. Visualization analysis shows IRSN better captures differences between similar style classes.

Conclusion: IRSN effectively classifies fashion styles by analyzing both global and item-specific features with their combinations, outperforming baseline models significantly and demonstrating better capability to distinguish visually similar styles.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how different activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) and optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad) affect performance in Human Activity Recognition using BiLSTM and ConvLSTM architectures on medical activity datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep learning-based HAR systems are widely used, the impact of activation functions and optimizer combinations on performance hasn't been sufficiently analyzed, especially for practical healthcare applications where reliable action recognition is critical.

Method: The study investigates three activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad) using two recurrent architectures (BiLSTM and ConvLSTM). Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes from HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets.

Result: ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM with Adam or RMSprop achieves up to 99.00% accuracy, showing strong spatio-temporal learning. BiLSTM performs well on UCF101 (~98.00%) but drops to ~60.00% on HMDB51, showing limited robustness and sensitivity to AF/MO variations.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical. ConvLSTM with Adam or RMSprop demonstrates superior performance and stability for medical activity recognition tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiDARDraft: A method for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds from diverse inputs (text, images, sketches) using 3D layouts as intermediate representation and ControlNet for generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LiDAR generation methods struggle with high-quality results and versatile controllability due to imbalance between complex LiDAR distributions and simple control signals. Need for better simulation tools in autonomous driving.

Method: 1) Convert text, images, and point clouds into unified 3D layouts; 2) Transform layouts into semantic and depth control signals; 3) Use rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation with pixel-level alignment.

Result: Enables "simulation from scratch" - creating self-driving environments from arbitrary textual descriptions, images, and sketches with excellent performance in controllable LiDAR generation.

Conclusion: LiDARDraft successfully bridges versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds using 3D layouts as intermediate representation, achieving high-quality controllable generation for autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

*Hao Guo,Xugong Qin,Jun Jie Ou Yang,Peng Zhang,Gangyan Zeng,Yubo Li,Hailun Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NL-DIR, a new benchmark for Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval using fine-grained semantic queries instead of coarse image-based queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DIR methods struggle with real-world scenarios where users provide textual queries with fine-grained semantics, not just coarse category-based image queries.

Method: Created NL-DIR dataset with 41K document images, each paired with 5 high-quality semantic queries generated by LLMs and manually verified. Evaluated existing contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free VDU models with zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches, plus a two-stage retrieval method for efficiency.

Result: Established comprehensive benchmark with evaluation metrics, showing performance of various models on fine-grained semantic retrieval. Two-stage method improves performance while maintaining time and space efficiency.

Conclusion: NL-DIR benchmark addresses the gap in fine-grained semantic document retrieval and provides new opportunities for the VDU community, with publicly available datasets and code.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

*Thanh-Tung Le,Tuan Pham,Tung Nguyen,Deying Kong,Xiaohui Xie,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining deterministic and stochastic approaches for novel view synthesis: uses bidirectional transformer for shared latent representation, with regression head for well-constrained areas and diffusion head for occluded regions, achieving SOTA quality with 10x faster rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NVS methods have trade-offs: deterministic networks render quickly but blur unobserved areas, while diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content but are computationally expensive. Need a unified approach that combines speed and quality.

Method: Bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings into shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads: (1) feed-forward regression head for well-constrained geometry, (2) masked autoregressive diffusion head for occluded/unseen regions. End-to-end training with joint photometric and diffusion losses, no handcrafted 3D inductive biases.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared to fully generative baselines. Enables scalability across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: Proposed hybrid framework successfully unifies deterministic and stochastic paradigms, offering both high-quality rendering and computational efficiency for novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

*Alireza Moayedikia,Sattar Dorafshan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-modal attention network fuses radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection, outperforming single-modal and concatenation fusion approaches with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated inspection of deteriorating civil infrastructure is needed to overcome visual assessment limitations. Single-modal approaches (Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography) have complementary constraints: radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography has weather dependency and limited depth.

Method: Multi-modal attention network with temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross-modal fusion with learnable embeddings. Incorporates uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components.

Result: On five bridge datasets with balanced to moderately imbalanced data, the approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC. Cross-modal attention provides critical gains beyond within-modality attention. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error and enables selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases.

Conclusion: Attention-based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme class imbalance requires specialized techniques. The system maintains deployment efficiency for real-time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

TL;DR: DDAVS: A framework for audio-visual segmentation that addresses multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment through disentangled audio semantics and delayed bidirectional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-visual segmentation methods suffer from multi-source entanglement (biasing toward louder/larger objects while overlooking weaker/smaller/co-occurring sources) and audio-visual misalignment, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes DDAVS with two key components: 1) Learnable queries to extract audio semantics anchored in a structured semantic space from an audio prototype memory bank, optimized via contrastive learning; 2) Dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction for robust multimodal alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks show DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios.

Conclusion: DDAVS effectively addresses key challenges in audio-visual segmentation through disentangled audio semantics and delayed bidirectional alignment, validating its effectiveness and generalization ability under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

*Mohammad Helal Uddin,Liam Seymour,Sabur Baidya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HEART-ViT is a Hessian-guided dynamic attention and token pruning framework for Vision Transformers that uses second-order sensitivity analysis to achieve significant computational savings while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have state-of-the-art accuracy but suffer from quadratic attention cost and redundant computations, making them difficult to deploy on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning methods treat tokens or heads in isolation using heuristics or first-order signals, often sacrificing accuracy or failing to generalize.

Method: HEART-ViT uses Hessian-vector products to estimate curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets. It's a unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework that combines token pruning (for computational savings) with head pruning (for fine-grained redundancy removal).

Result: Achieves up to 49.4% FLOPs reduction, 36% lower latency, and 46% higher throughput on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16. Consistently matches or surpasses baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, with 4.7% recovery at 40% token pruning. Real-world deployment on edge devices (AGX Orin) shows direct translation to inference speed and energy efficiency gains.

Conclusion: HEART-ViT bridges theory and practice as the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient, revealing that token pruning dominates computational savings while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, with their combination achieving superior trade-offs.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar offers privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant HPE, but radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making robust feature extraction challenging. Need to address missing joints caused by sparse signals.

Method: 1) Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity; 2) Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder to predict joint coordinates across multiple frames; 3) Velocity loss alongside standard keypoint loss to reinforce motion smoothness.

Result: Significant performance improvements on TransHuPR and HuPR datasets, exceeding baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Conclusion: milliMamba effectively addresses sparse radar signal challenges through joint spatio-temporal modeling, enabling robust human pose estimation from radar data while preserving privacy and lighting invariance advantages.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct orchard scenes and automate apple pose annotation, reducing manual labeling by 99.6% while achieving high F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple pose estimation in orchards is challenging due to environmental variation, occlusions, and the difficulty/time required for manual annotation of key points like calyx. Existing methods need these annotations but they're hard to obtain due to occlusions causing conflicting/missing labels across images.

Method: Novel pipeline: 1) 3D Gaussian Splatting for orchard scene reconstruction, 2) Simplified manual annotations, 3) Automated projection of annotations to images, 4) Training and evaluation of pose estimation method. Uses 3D reconstruction to simplify annotation and enlarge datasets.

Result: Only 105 manual annotations needed to generate 28,191 training labels (99.6% reduction). Best performance with labels of fruits ≤95% occluded: F1 score 0.927 on original images, 0.970 on rendered images. Training dataset size had small effect on performance. Least occluded fruits had best position estimation (worsened with occlusion). Orientation estimation failed to learn correctly.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D reconstruction pipeline significantly reduces annotation effort while maintaining good pose estimation performance for position, though orientation estimation remains challenging. The method enables efficient dataset creation for occluded fruit scenarios in orchard automation.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

*Grega Šuštar,Jer Pelhan,Alan Lukežič,Matej Kristan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a latent diffusion-based low-shot object counter that generates high-quality density maps for accurate object localization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on FSC and MCAC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-shot object counting methods have limitations: density-based counters have poor localization capabilities, while point-detection-based counters underperform on images with very large numbers of objects and require ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling.

Method: CoDi uses latent diffusion to generate high-quality density maps, with a novel exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts object prototypes to intermediate layers of the denoising network for accurate object location estimation.

Result: On FSC benchmark: outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE (few-shot), 13% MAE (one-shot), and 10% MAE (reference-less). On MCAC benchmark: sets new state-of-the-art by outperforming top method by 44% MAE.

Conclusion: CoDi is the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that effectively addresses both counting accuracy and localization quality, particularly excelling in dense object scenarios where previous methods struggled.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Motivation: Multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models shows promise but lacks understanding of learning dynamics and data efficiency. The paper aims to systematically study this approach to enable training at lower computational cost.

Method: Introduces AMoE which distills SigLIP2 and DINOv3 into a Mixture-of-Experts student. Key innovations: 1) Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserving teacher geometric properties, 2) token-balanced batching for stable multi-resolution training, 3) hierarchical clustering and sampling for improved data efficiency.

Result: Created OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus demonstrating superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. The combined techniques enable effective knowledge transfer while reducing computational requirements.

Conclusion: Multi-teacher distillation can be made more efficient through careful design of distillation loss, batching strategies, and data sampling. The released OpenLVD200M corpus and distilled models provide practical resources for vision foundation model development.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

### [66] [Generative Latent Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20194)
*Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Houqiang Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLC is a generative latent coding architecture that performs compression in VQ-VAE latent space instead of pixel space, achieving high realism and fidelity at ultra-low bitrates (<0.04 bpp).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-space compression struggles with high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrates because pixel-space distortion doesn't align well with human perception. Need better perceptual alignment for compression.

Method: Transform coding in VQ-VAE latent space (generative latent space) instead of pixel space. Uses categorical hyper module to reduce hyper-information bit cost and code-prediction-based supervision for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves <0.04 bpp on natural images and <0.01 bpp on facial images with high visual quality. On CLIC2020, matches MS-ILLM FID with 45% fewer bits. Enables applications like image restoration and style transfer.

Conclusion: Generative latent space coding provides superior compression with better perceptual alignment, enabling high-quality ultra-low-bitrate compression and supporting downstream applications.

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

*Tao Ye,Hongbin Ren,Chongbing Zhang,Haoran Chen,Xiaosong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JDPNet is a joint degradation processing network that effectively handles nonlinear coupled degradations in underwater images through unified feature mining and adjustment, achieving state-of-the-art performance with balanced computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from complex, nonlinearly coupled degradations that existing methods struggle to handle effectively. Most approaches focus on specific degradations individually without addressing their coupled interactions, failing to capture the nonlinear relationships between multiple degradation types.

Method: Proposes JDPNet with: 1) Joint feature-mining module with probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy to mine and unify coupled degradation features; 2) AquaBalanceLoss to balance color, clarity, and contrast by learning from multiple coupled degradation losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public underwater datasets and two newly constructed datasets, while offering better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: JDPNet effectively addresses the challenge of nonlinear coupled degradations in underwater images through unified feature mining and adjustment, providing a practical solution with balanced performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

*Xiangxuan Ren,Zhongdao Wang,Pin Tang,Guoqing Wang,Jilai Zheng,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteFusion is a novel multi-modal 3D detector that uses LiDAR as complementary geometric information for camera-based detection, eliminating 3D backbone dependency for better deployment across diverse hardware platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal 3D detectors rely heavily on LiDAR and complex architectures, suffering performance drops without LiDAR and deployment difficulties on non-GPU hardware due to 3D sparse convolution operators optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.

Method: Instead of treating LiDAR as independent modality, LiteFusion uses LiDAR data as complementary geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. It integrates LiDAR features into image features within quaternion space, preserving orthogonal constraints during training to model domain-specific relations across modalities.

Result: On nuScenes dataset, LiteFusion improves baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with only 1.1% parameter increase, without dedicated LiDAR encoders. Maintains strong results even without LiDAR input.

Conclusion: LiteFusion offers a deployment-friendly approach that eliminates 3D backbone dependency, provides robust performance across diverse fusion paradigms, and enables deployment on various hardware platforms while maintaining strong detection accuracy.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicDLP is a large-scale multilingual document layout dataset covering 11 Indic languages plus English across 12 domains, addressing limitations of existing datasets in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document layout datasets have critical limitations: large-scale datasets (PubLayNet, DocBank) lack fine-grained labels and multilingual diversity, while human-annotated datasets (M6Doc, D4LA) are too small and lack multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents with diverse scripts, limiting progress in document understanding.

Method: Introduced IndicDLP - a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English, covering 12 common document domains. Also curated UED-mini dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc to enhance pretraining and provide foundation for Indic layout models.

Result: Fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it valuable for document digitization.

Conclusion: IndicDLP bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding. The dataset addresses underrepresentation of Indic documents and provides a valuable resource for multilingual document layout analysis.

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

TL;DR: DAMP is a unified HSI restoration framework that uses degradation metrics as prompts instead of explicit degradation labels, enabling adaptive restoration under diverse degradations through spatial-spectral modulation and Mixture-of-Experts architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified HSI restoration methods rely on explicit degradation priors/labels that are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios with complex mixed degradations. There's a need for a more practical approach that doesn't require predefined degradation information.

Method: Proposes Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework with: 1) Spatial-spectral degradation metrics to quantify degradations as Degradation Prompts, 2) Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) for dynamic feature modulation, 3) Mixture-of-Experts architecture using SSAM as experts and DP as gating router.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets, demonstrates exceptional generalization capability under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations.

Conclusion: DAMP provides a practical unified HSI restoration solution that doesn't require explicit degradation priors, enabling robust performance across various degradation scenarios through metric-based prompting and adaptive feature modulation.

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiCoR-Seg is a bidirectional co-refinement framework for high-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation that addresses inter-class similarity and intra-class variability through heatmap-driven bidirectional information synergy and hierarchical supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation faces challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing methods struggle to inject abstract semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes.

Method: Proposes BiCoR-Seg with three key components: 1) Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS) that establishes bidirectional flow between feature maps and class embeddings via class-level heatmaps, 2) Hierarchical supervision using interpretable heatmaps as low-resolution predictions, and 3) Cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate outstanding segmentation performance with stronger interpretability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg effectively addresses the challenges of high inter-class similarity and intra-class variability in HRSS through bidirectional co-refinement, achieving superior performance while providing enhanced interpretability through heatmap-based visualization.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

TL;DR: LADLE-MM is a lightweight multimodal misinformation detector that achieves competitive performance with 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than SOTA models, even without grounding annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of accessible multimedia manipulation tools has enabled widespread synthetic content creation, often involving cross-modal manipulations that distort narratives and spread misinformation. Existing detection methods are computationally intensive or require large annotated datasets, creating a need for efficient detectors that work with limited annotations and resources.

Method: LADLE-MM uses a model-soup initialized architecture with two unimodal branches (image and text) and a multimodal branch that enhances representations with BLIP-extracted multimodal embeddings as a fixed reference space. This design enables operation under limited annotation setups and constrained training resources.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on DGM4 benchmark for binary and multi-label classification, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. On VERITE dataset, outperforms more complex LVLM-based approaches, demonstrating effective generalization in open-set settings and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

Conclusion: LADLE-MM provides an efficient, lightweight solution for multimodal misinformation detection that works well with limited annotations and resources, offering strong generalization capabilities while being more parameter-efficient than existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D³ETOR is a two-stage WSCOD framework that uses debate-enhanced pseudo labeling and frequency-aware progressive debiasing to overcome limitations in weakly-supervised camouflaged object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSCOD methods lag behind fully supervised ones due to unreliable pseudo masks from general segmentation models (lacking task-specific understanding) and neglect of scribble annotation bias that hinders global structure capture.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling with adaptive entropy-driven point sampling and multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance SAM for COD; 2) FADeNet with progressive fusion of multi-level frequency-aware features and dynamic reweighting of supervision strength to alleviate scribble bias.

Result: Significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: D³ETOR effectively addresses key limitations in WSCOD by improving pseudo mask quality through debate mechanisms and mitigating scribble bias through frequency-aware progressive debiasing, enabling competitive performance with sparse supervision.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging have become increasingly complex (ResNets, Vision Transformers, Hybrid CNNs), compromising explainability. While SHAP provides interpretable visualizations, its explanations can be unstable and unreliable due to epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, especially in medical imaging with varying image qualities and modalities.

Method: Proposes a framework combining Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations. Uses belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to measure uncertainty from unstable explanations.

Result: The framework was evaluated on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types (pathology, ophthalmology, radiology), which introduce noise from varying resolutions and modality-specific aspects, creating significant epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: The study addresses the critical challenge of unreliable SHAP explanations in medical imaging by providing a systematic approach to quantify uncertainty, making model interpretations more trustworthy for domain experts working with complex deep learning models.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: TAVID successfully generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner, addressing the multimodal nature of human conversation through cross-modal information exchange.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation.

In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT-based video virtual try-on methods struggle with fine-grained garment dynamics, background integrity preservation, and high computational costs due to additional interaction modules. Limited scale and quality of existing datasets also restrict model generalization and training effectiveness.

Method: KeyTailor uses a keyframe-driven details injection strategy with instruction-guided keyframe sampling to filter informative frames. It employs two tailored modules: garment details enhancement module (distills garment dynamics into latents) and collaborative background optimization module (optimizes background latents). These enriched details are injected into standard DiT blocks with pose, mask, and noise latents without modifying DiT architecture.

Result: KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios. The ViT-HD dataset contains 15,070 high-quality video samples at 810*1080 resolution covering diverse garments.

Conclusion: KeyTailor provides an efficient and realistic video virtual try-on solution that captures fine-grained garment dynamics while preserving background consistency, avoiding architectural modifications to DiTs and reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

TL;DR: CRAFT introduces a training-free framework for improving text-to-image generation through structured reasoning, verification, and targeted prompt edits, achieving better compositional accuracy with minimal inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time reasoning approaches for text-to-image generation rely on implicit critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making them difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. The paper aims to bring the structured reasoning paradigm that has benefited large language models (verification, targeted correction, early stopping) to multimodal image generation.

Method: CRAFT decomposes prompts into dependency-structured visual questions, verifies generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satisfied, creating an interpretable and controllable inference-time refinement loop.

Result: CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. These improvements come with negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller models to approach the quality of more expensive systems.

Conclusion: Explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models, offering interpretable and controllable refinement without retraining.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

### [79] [SmartSplat: Feature-Smart Gaussians for Scalable Compression of Ultra-High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20377)
*Linfei Li,Lin Zhang,Zhong Wang,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartSplat is a Gaussian Splatting-based image compression framework that uses adaptive sampling strategies to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining reconstruction quality for ultra-high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of compressing ultra-high-resolution visual content generated by AI, where existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity. Current 2D Gaussian image models inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting lack efficiency in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

Method: SmartSplat uses image-aware features (gradients and color variances) with two key sampling strategies: 1) Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling, 2) Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling for non-overlapping Gaussian coverage. It also employs Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling for color initialization across scales, with joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization.

Result: Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a new 16K dataset show SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios, exceeds their compression limits, and demonstrates strong scalability and practical applicability.

Conclusion: SmartSplat provides an effective solution for ultra-high-resolution image compression by efficiently capturing both local structures and global textures using limited Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression with arbitrary resolution support.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

*Junho Yoon,Jaemo Jung,Hyunju Kim,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DETACH: A decomposed spatio-temporal framework for aligning exocentric video with ambient sensors, addressing limitations of global alignment approaches in capturing local details and handling similar temporal patterns with different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric video with wearable sensors has practical limitations (user discomfort, privacy concerns, scalability). Exocentric video with ambient sensors offers a non-intrusive, scalable alternative, but existing global alignment methods fail in this setting due to inability to capture local details and over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns.

Method: DETACH: A decomposed spatio-temporal framework that explicitly decomposes features to preserve local details. Uses novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering for semantic grounding. Two-stage alignment: (1) establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, (2) performs temporal alignment via spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles different types of negatives.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DETACH effectively addresses the limitations of global alignment in exocentric-ambient settings by decomposing spatio-temporal features and using a novel two-stage alignment approach, enabling better action recognition with non-intrusive, scalable sensing.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Vision-Language Models for video surveillance have inherent bias towards normality, failing to detect crimes. Chain-of-Thought reasoning lacks inductive anomaly biases, further steering models toward normal interpretations.

Method: Propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias through a final anomaly-focused classification layer.

Result: Significantly improves Anomaly Detection (F1-score +11.8 p.p. on low-resolution footage) and Anomaly Classification (+3.78 p.p. on high-resolution videos).

Conclusion: Introducing inductive criminal bias through CoAT framework effectively addresses the normality bias problem in automated video surveillance, substantially improving crime detection performance.

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Conclusion: The soft voting ensemble CNN method with segmentation preprocessing provides an effective approach for early skin cancer classification, achieving high accuracy while balancing computational requirements for potential real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets.

TL;DR: TBSD method for efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds using texture basis learning and decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations when applied to textured defect images: non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale structured datasets.

Method: Texture Basis integrated Smooth Decomposition (TBSD) approach with two processes: 1) learns texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic texture patterns, 2) uses texture basis as prior knowledge for anomaly detection to prevent texture misidentification.

Result: Surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TBSD provides an effective solution for anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds, addressing limitations of conventional methods through mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and texture basis learning.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Incorporating physically inferred joint actuation forces into motion understanding pipelines consistently improves performance across gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing vision-based motion understanding methods overlook physical cues like joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics, creating a gap in understanding whether and when these forces enhance motion analysis.

Method: Incorporating physically inferred forces into established motion understanding pipelines and systematically evaluating their impact across baseline models on three major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning.

Result: Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yielded consistent performance gains: gait recognition improved by +0.87% on CASIA-B (with larger gains under challenging conditions), +1.3% on Gait3D; action recognition improved by +2.00% on Penn Action; video captioning ROUGE-L score increased from 0.310 to 0.339.

Conclusion: Force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features, especially under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions, demonstrating the value of incorporating physics-inferred forces in motion understanding systems.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion-based text-to-image models have strong visual content generation capabilities, their text rendering performance for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts remains limited, creating a need for better AI-assisted graphic design tools.

Method: UTDesign introduces a DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on synthetic data to generate transparent RGBA text foregrounds, extended into a conditional text generation framework with multi-modal condition encoder, and integrated into a fully automated text-to-design pipeline with pre-trained T2I models and MLLM-based layout planner.

Result: Extensive experiments show UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in stylistic consistency and text accuracy, with unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Conclusion: UTDesign provides a unified framework for high-quality stylized text editing and generation in design images, addressing limitations of existing text-to-image models for typography and non-Latin scripts, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research evaluates adaptive RGB and LWIR fusion for UAS-based landmine detection using YOLO architectures, finding optimal performance with YOLOv11 and 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude, with tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landmines pose a severe humanitarian threat with 110 million deployed mines across 60 countries causing 26,000 annual casualties. There's a need for effective UAS-based detection methods leveraging thermal contrast between mines and surrounding soil.

Method: Used adaptive RGB and Long-Wave Infrared fusion for surface-laid landmine detection via UAS. Evaluated YOLO architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images (35,640 model-condition evaluations). Compared with RF-DETR, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet. Used aggregated multi-temporal training datasets and analyzed detection performance for different mine types.

Result: YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP) with 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude. RF-DETR had highest accuracy (69.2% mAP) but YOLOv11 trained 17.7x faster (41 min vs 12 hours). Multi-temporal datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8-9.6%. Anti-Tank mines detected at 61.9% vs 19.2% for Anti-Personnel mines.

Conclusion: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion with YOLOv11 provides effective landmine detection with optimal thermal fusion parameters identified. There's a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff between transformer-based and YOLO architectures. Future research should examine thermal contrast effects for buried mines across different soil types.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignPose is a multi-view 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates RGB information from calibrated cameras without object-specific training, using feature-metric refinement to optimize consistent world-frame poses across views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view RGB pose estimation suffers from depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view methods can solve these issues but existing approaches either rely on precise single-view estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects.

Method: AlignPose aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views without object-specific training. Key innovation is multi-view feature-metric refinement that optimizes a single consistent world-frame object pose by minimizing feature discrepancy between rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using BOP benchmark show AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available.

Conclusion: AlignPose effectively addresses limitations of single-view pose estimation through multi-view aggregation and feature-metric refinement, demonstrating strong performance particularly in industrial settings where multiple camera views are practical.

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

TL;DR: MTIF introduces multi-grained text guidance for image fusion, using hierarchical text descriptions and cross-modal alignment to improve fusion quality for multi-exposure and multi-focus tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided image fusion methods use coarse-grained descriptions that fail to capture fine details and struggle with precise cross-modal alignment, limiting fusion quality for challenging input conditions.

Method: Proposes MTIF with three key designs: 1) multi-grained textual descriptions (fine details, structural cues, semantic content), 2) hierarchical cross-modal modulation with granularity-specific supervision, and 3) saliency-driven enrichment module for training data augmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments show MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-grained text guidance with hierarchical cross-modal alignment effectively addresses limitations of coarse text descriptions, enabling superior image fusion quality for challenging input conditions.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with dynamic spatial reasoning (reasoning about object geometry and relationships in 3D space over time) due to lack of scalable 4D-aware training resources.

Method: 1) Automated pipeline generating DSR question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos using vision foundation models; 2) DSR-Train dataset for learning and human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation; 3) Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to integrate geometric priors into VLMs via compact geometry tokens.

Result: Integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances dynamic spatial reasoning while maintaining general video understanding accuracy.

Conclusion: DSR Suite bridges the gap in dynamic spatial reasoning across dataset, benchmark, and model aspects, enabling VLMs to better understand 4D spatial relationships.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM is a text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically prunes redundant visual tokens based on query relevance, achieving beyond lossless compression while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs process hundreds/thousands of visual tokens with quadratic attention cost and redundancy. Existing token reduction methods ignore textual queries or rely on unstable attention maps, leading to degraded semantic alignment.

Method: Computes explicit cross-modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in language model space. Fuses extrinsic relevance with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature-controlled sharpening. Includes diversity-preserving partition to retain minimal representative background tokens.

Result: Achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8% of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5. Maintains 92.8% accuracy under 94.4% compression. State-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs demonstrated across 14 image/video benchmarks with strong robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: FlashVLM provides an effective framework for text-guided visual token selection that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining or improving performance, addressing key limitations of existing token reduction methods.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: TransFuser v6 achieves SOTA on CARLA benchmarks by addressing expert-student misalignment in imitation learning for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning policies struggle with robust closed-loop performance despite unlimited simulator data, due to misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations (with higher visibility and lower uncertainty) and sensor-based student observations.

Method: Addresses asymmetries by narrowing gaps between expert and student through careful modifications, including handling expert's higher visibility (ignoring occlusions), lower uncertainty (knowing other vehicles' actions), and under-specified navigational intent in student models.

Result: TransFuser v6 achieves new SOTA on all major CARLA closed-loop benchmarks: 95 DS on Bench2Drive, more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Also shows consistent gains on NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks through perception supervision integration.

Conclusion: Addressing expert-student misalignment through systematic interventions significantly improves imitation learning performance for autonomous driving, enabling state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and demonstrating transferability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

TL;DR: DiTracker adapts pre-trained video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for point tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks through attention matching and lightweight tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point tracking methods rely on shallow convolutional backbones like ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions like dynamic motions and occlusions.

Method: DiTracker adapts video Diffusion Transformers through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone.

Result: Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks.

Conclusion: Video DiT features serve as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking, demonstrating strong capability in handling dynamic motions and frequent occlusions.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

TL;DR: FedPOD improves federated learning efficiency and communication costs by including outlier participants, eliminating dependency on previous rounds, and using validation loss calculation, achieving comparable performance to FedPIDAvg with better flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FedPIDAvg has limitations: it excludes outlier participants (limiting data utilization) and requires maintaining the same participants throughout training due to its dependency on previous rounds' learning information. FedPOD aims to address these issues while maintaining performance.

Method: FedPOD includes participants excluded as outliers, eliminates dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applies a method for calculating validation loss at each round. Inspired by Kubernetes' POD concept, it extends round-wise tasks to POD units for flexible design with scale-out capabilities similar to Kubernetes auto-scaling.

Result: FedPOD achieves comparable performance to FedPIDAvg with Dice scores of 0.78, 0.71, and 0.72 for WT, ET, and TC on average, and a projected convergence score of 0.74 on average.

Conclusion: FedPOD demonstrates potential to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance metrics while being compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling for better resource management.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

TL;DR: ORCA framework enables video avatars to autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction, moving beyond passive animation to active intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video avatar generation methods lack genuine agency - they can't autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. They excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but are essentially passive animations rather than active agents.

Method: ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture) introduces two key innovations: 1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) for robust state tracking under generative uncertainty, and 2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning while System 1 translates plans into precise action captions. The framework formulates avatar control as a POMDP with continuous belief updating and outcome verification.

Result: ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence. It enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios, validating the Internal World Model (IWM)-inspired design.

Conclusion: ORCA advances video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior by embodying Internal World Model capabilities through the OTAR cycle and hierarchical dual-system architecture, enabling genuine agency in stochastic generative environments.

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialTree introduces a cognitive-science-inspired 4-level hierarchy for spatial abilities in MLLMs (perception → mental mapping → simulation → agentic competence), creates a hierarchical benchmark, reveals skill interdependency patterns, discovers surprising transfer dynamics, and proposes an auto-think strategy to improve all levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM research lacks understanding of how spatial abilities develop hierarchically, with most studies focusing on narrow task sets rather than systematic cognitive progression from perception to reasoning and interaction.

Method: Proposes SpatialTree: a 4-level cognitive hierarchy (L1 perception, L2 mental mapping, L3 simulation, L4 agentic competence). Constructs capability-centric hierarchical benchmark with 27 sub-abilities. Evaluates mainstream MLLMs, analyzes skill correlations, conducts targeted supervised fine-tuning to study transfer dynamics, and explores RL approaches with auto-think strategy.

Result: Reveals clear structure: L1 skills are orthogonal, higher-level skills strongly correlated. Finds negative transfer within L1 but strong cross-level transfer from low to high abilities with synergy. Shows naive RL with extensive thinking helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. Auto-think strategy suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling consistent RL improvement across all levels.

Conclusion: SpatialTree provides a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs, offering insights into hierarchical skill development, transfer dynamics, and effective training strategies for comprehensive spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen generates videos in semantic space rather than VAE latent space, using a two-stage diffusion process for faster convergence and more efficient long video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models using VAE latent space suffer from slow convergence and computational inefficiency, especially for long videos. The authors propose generating in semantic space to address these limitations.

Method: Two-stage diffusion process: 1) Generate compact semantic video features (global layout) using diffusion, 2) Generate VAE latents conditioned on semantic features to add high-frequency details.

Result: SemanticGen achieves faster convergence than VAE latent space methods, is computationally efficient for long videos, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in video quality.

Conclusion: Generating videos in semantic space with a two-stage diffusion approach is more efficient and effective than direct VAE latent modeling, enabling high-quality video generation with better convergence and computational efficiency.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

TL;DR: Reason2Decide is a two-stage training framework that improves clinical decision support by generating better-aligned explanations while maintaining high predictive accuracy, using smaller models than foundation LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision support systems need both high predictive accuracy and explanations that align with predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations between predictions and rationales.

Method: Two-stage training framework: Stage-1 trains on rationale generation, Stage-2 jointly trains on label prediction and rationale generation using scheduled sampling to transition from gold labels to model predictions.

Result: Outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity across three medical datasets. Works with models 40x smaller than foundation models and is robust across different rationale sources (LLM-generated, nurse-authored, nurse-post-processed).

Conclusion: Reason2Decide makes clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while providing explainable decision support, and shows LLM-generated rationales can reduce reliance on human annotations for pretraining.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLM-based SRS planning agent improves plan quality and provides transparent, auditable decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption in stereotactic radiosurgery due to opacity concerns, despite the need for precise dose shaping around critical structures.

Method: Developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent tested on 41 brain metastasis patients. Compared two variants: non-reasoning vs reasoning models using chain-of-thought reasoning. Analyzed planning behaviors, dosimetry endpoints, and optimization traces.

Result: Reasoning model achieved comparable dosimetry to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, max dose, conformity/gradient indices) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines. Showed systematic planning behaviors including constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), unlike standard model. Optimization traces provide auditable logs.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning enables transparent, auditable automated planning with clinical-grade performance, addressing opacity concerns of black-box AI systems in SRS treatment planning.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

TL;DR: ProbGLC: A probabilistic cross-view geolocalization approach for rapid disaster response that combines probabilistic and deterministic models to enhance both accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As climate change intensifies disasters, rapid response requires accurate location identification. Current methods lack explainability and uncertainty quantification needed for reliable decision-making in disaster scenarios.

Method: Unified framework combining probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models. Uses cross-view imagery pairs from multiple disaster types, provides probabilistic distributions and localizability scores for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 0.86 Acc@1km and 0.97 Acc@25km on MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster datasets. Provides explainability through probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Conclusion: ProbGLC demonstrates superior accuracy and explainability for disaster geolocalization, offering a promising generative approach for location awareness in rapid disaster response scenarios.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: Multi-agent framework for long-video QA where a master LLM coordinates grounding and vision agents to localize relevant segments and extract visual details, trained with RL for efficient cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs for long-video QA compress content into lossy summaries or use limited toolsets, which weakens temporal grounding and misses fine-grained visual cues needed for accurate episode-level reasoning.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent framework with: 1) Master LLM that coordinates agents and plans with step limits, 2) Grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments, 3) Vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines on proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ datasets (episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+). Reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning capabilities of the trained agent.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework effectively addresses limitations of existing long-video QA methods by improving temporal grounding, complementing subtitles with visual details, and producing interpretable reasoning trajectories through coordinated agent cooperation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

TL;DR: A 3D display system using digital encoder and diffractive optical decoder achieves high-resolution volumetric imaging with wavelength-scale axial separation through deep learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D displays struggle with dense depth multiplexing due to diffraction-induced cross-talk when axial planes get closer, limiting volumetric imaging capabilities.

Method: Combines digital encoder (Fourier encoder network with axial position encoding) and diffractive optical decoder, optimized end-to-end with deep learning for snapshot 3D projection.

Result: Achieves axial plane separations on wavelength scale, displays 28 axial slices, enables dynamic reconfiguration, and shows close agreement between measured and target images.

Conclusion: Establishes a compact, scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D projection with applications in holographic displays, AR/VR, and volumetric optical computing.

Abstract: 3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.

*Davide Stauba,Finn Rabe,Akhil Misra,Yves Pauli,Roya Hüppi,Nils Lang,Lars Michels,Victoria Edkins,Sascha Frühholz,Iris Sommer,Wolfram Hinzen,Philipp Homan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study uses LLM-derived drift and shift signals to show that language coherence involves dissociable neural regimes: slow contextual integration in default-mode networks and rapid event-driven reconfiguration in auditory/language cortices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language comprehension requires balancing gradual meaning accumulation across context with rapid representation reconfiguration at event boundaries, but how these competing temporal demands are implemented neurally during naturalistic listening remains unclear.

Method: Used LLM-derived annotation-free drift and shift signals formalizing contextual drift and event shifts from narrative input. Densely sampled one adult across 7+ hours of crime story listening with 7T fMRI, then modeled feature-informed hemodynamic responses using regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories.

Result: Drift predictions prevalent in default-mode network hubs; shift predictions evident bilaterally in primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Default-mode and parietal networks best explained by signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over narrative course.

Conclusion: Language coherence is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering mechanistic entry point for understanding language coherence disturbances in psychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Dreamcrafter is a VR-based 3D scene editing system that combines immersive direct manipulation with generative AI techniques for real-time editing of 3D Radiance Fields, offering multiple control levels and proxy representations to handle latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to 3D scene authoring have limitations: immersive direct manipulation lacks high-level abstraction, while AI-based methods using 3D Radiance Fields (NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) offer abstraction but suffer from high latency. The authors aim to unify these complementary strengths to create a better 3D scene editing system.

Method: Dreamcrafter introduces a VR-based system with: 1) modular architecture for integrating generative AI algorithms, 2) combined control levels including natural language and direct manipulation, and 3) proxy representations that support interaction during high-latency operations.

Result: The system enables real-time, immersive editing of 3D Radiance Fields while maintaining high-level abstraction capabilities. The paper contributes empirical findings on user control preferences and demonstrates how generative AI interfaces beyond text input enhance creativity in scene editing and world building.

Conclusion: Dreamcrafter successfully unifies immersive direct manipulation with generative AI techniques for 3D scene editing, showing that combining different control levels and using proxy representations can overcome latency challenges while enhancing creative possibilities in spatial computing applications.

Abstract: Authoring 3D scenes is a central task for spatial computing applications. Competing visions for lowering existing barriers are (1) focus on immersive, direct manipulation of 3D content or (2) leverage AI techniques that capture real scenes (3D Radiance Fields such as, NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) and modify them at a higher level of abstraction, at the cost of high latency. We unify the complementary strengths of these approaches and investigate how to integrate generative AI advances into real-time, immersive 3D Radiance Field editing. We introduce Dreamcrafter, a VR-based 3D scene editing system that: (1) provides a modular architecture to integrate generative AI algorithms; (2) combines different levels of control for creating objects, including natural language and direct manipulation; and (3) introduces proxy representations that support interaction during high-latency operations. We contribute empirical findings on control preferences and discuss how generative AI interfaces beyond text input enhance creativity in scene editing and world building.

*Zhongyu Xia,Wenhao Chen,Yongtao Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KnowVal is an autonomous driving system that integrates visual-language reasoning with knowledge retrieval from a comprehensive driving knowledge graph and value-aligned trajectory assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving approaches rely too heavily on data-driven learning, which struggles to capture complex decision-making logic through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. There's a need for systems that can perform visual-language reasoning while incorporating driving knowledge and value alignment.

Method: 1) Construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph encoding traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms. 2) Develop an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism for driving scenarios. 3) Create a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model for interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed KnowVal system successfully addresses limitations of data-driven approaches by integrating knowledge retrieval and value alignment, demonstrating superior performance in autonomous driving planning while maintaining interpretability and compatibility with existing systems.

Abstract: Visual-language reasoning, driving knowledge, and value alignment are essential for advanced autonomous driving systems. However, existing approaches largely rely on data-driven learning, making it difficult to capture the complex logic underlying decision-making through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. To address this, we propose KnowVal, a new autonomous driving system that enables visual-language reasoning through the synergistic integration of open-world perception and knowledge retrieval. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model to guide interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves planning performance while remaining compatible with existing architectures. Notably, KnowVal achieves the lowest collision rate on nuScenes and state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive.

### [108] [Making Large Language Models Efficient Dense Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20612)
*Yibin Lei,Shwai He,Ang Li,Andrew Yates*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EffiR: Efficient LLM-based dense retrieval framework that compresses MLP layers through coarse-to-fine pruning while preserving attention layers, achieving significant model size reduction without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM fine-tuning for dense retrieval yields strong performance, their large parameter counts make them computationally inefficient. Prior work shows layer redundancy in generative tasks, but it's unclear if similar redundancy exists in retrieval tasks which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than token generation.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers reveals MLP layers are substantially more prunable than attention layers. Based on this insight, EffiR performs large-scale MLP compression through coarse-to-fine strategy: coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction, combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models.

Conclusion: MLP layers in LLM-based dense retrievers are highly redundant and can be compressed significantly, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. The proposed EffiR framework effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining retrieval performance.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that directly fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for dense retrieval yields strong performance, but their substantial parameter counts make them computationally inefficient. While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it remains unclear whether similar redundancy exists when these models are adapted for retrieval tasks, which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than generating tokens iteratively. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers. We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning. Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models.

Conclusion: The approach shows strong potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis by providing accurate, automated bowel cleanliness assessment.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually.

We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.

TL;DR: Dual-encoder TransUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance (85.4% Dice) for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from multimodal diffusion MRI by learning modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions from diffusion MRI is essential for clinical decision-making and outcome assessment, but automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance in DWI and ADC scans.

Method: Benchmarked various architectures (U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, TransUNet) on ISLES 2022 dataset, then proposed a dual-encoder TransUNet to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs, incorporating spatial context via three-slice input configuration.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-encoder TransUNet framework offers a robust solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer architectures and modality-specific feature learning.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for clinical decision-making and outcome assessment. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance.
  In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs. To incorporate spatial context, adjacent slice information is integrated using a three-slice input configuration.
  All models are trained under a unified framework and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results show that transformer-based models outperform convolutional baselines, and the proposed dual-encoder TransUNet achieves the best performance, reaching a Dice score of 85.4% on the test set. The proposed framework offers a robust solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI.

TL;DR: SAM Audio is a unified foundation model for general audio separation that supports text, visual, and temporal span prompting, achieving SOTA across diverse audio domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio separation models are either domain-specific (limited to speech/music) or have limited controllability with only single prompting modalities like text. There's a need for a general-purpose model that can handle multiple prompting modalities across diverse audio types.

Method: Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds. Unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework for flexible target source separation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems.

Conclusion: SAM Audio represents a significant advancement in general audio separation, offering multimodal prompting capabilities and superior performance across domains, with the introduction of new benchmarks and evaluation methods that correlate well with human judgment.

Abstract: General audio source separation is a key capability for multimodal AI systems that can perceive and reason about sound. Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only a single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, a foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and a reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment.

### [112] [Brain-Grounded Axes for Reading and Steering LLM States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19399)
*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using human brain activity as a coordinate system to read and steer LLM states, creating neurophysiology-grounded interpretable axes for LLM control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM interpretability methods rely on textual supervision which lacks external grounding. The paper proposes using human brain activity as an objective, biologically-grounded coordinate system for understanding and controlling LLM representations.

Method: Constructed word-level brain atlas from SMN4Lang MEG dataset using phase-locking value patterns, extracted latent axes via ICA, validated with independent lexica and NER-based labels. Trained lightweight adapters to map LLM hidden states to brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM, then steered along brain-derived directions.

Result: Found robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in mid TinyLlama layer that survives perplexity-matched controls. Brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts with lower perplexity for brain axis. Function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering across TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2. Axis structure remains stable when atlas is rebuilt with different embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95).

Conclusion: Neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior, offering a new interface for LLM interpretability that uses brain activity as an objective coordinate system rather than relying solely on textual supervision.

Abstract: Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning in LLMs by formalizing it as a latent variable model and developing better methods for generating rationales that justify correct answers, connecting EM with modern reward-based optimization.

Method: Formalize reasoning as latent variable model, derive EM objective, instantiate and compare sampling schemes: rejection sampling with budget, STaR, and PPS (keeping only rationalization stage of STaR).

Result: Experiments on ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with Llama and Qwen models show sampling scheme significantly affects accuracy; PPS outperforms other sampling schemes despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: The sampling scheme for generating rationales is crucial for learning to reason effectively, and the simple PPS method outperforms more complex alternatives, demonstrating the importance of focusing on rationale generation that justifies correct answers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Double-Win NAS is a neural architecture search paradigm that first searches for accurate deep networks, then transforms them into efficient shallow networks for embedded systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep CNNs achieve good accuracy but have poor hardware efficiency on embedded systems, while shallow networks are hardware-efficient but less accurate. There's a need to bridge this gap for resource-constrained embedded intelligence applications.

Method: A deep-to-shallow transformable NAS paradigm that: 1) Searches for accurate deep networks, 2) Equivalently transforms them into shallow counterparts, 3) Uses hybrid transformable training for better accuracy, and 4) Employs arbitrary-resolution elastic training for network elasticity across input resolutions.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson Nano platforms using ImageNet and ImageNet-100 datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

Conclusion: Double-Win NAS successfully addresses the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in embedded systems by enabling transformation from deep accurate networks to shallow efficient networks, achieving both strong accuracy and hardware efficiency.

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

*Nathan Roos,Ekaterina Iakovleva,Ani Gjergji,Vito Paolo Pastore,Enzo Tartaglione*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models amplify dataset biases, but this paper shows sampling algorithms and hyperparameters significantly affect bias amplification, not just the model itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion models achieve SOTA image synthesis, they replicate dataset biases. Previous work treated bias amplification as inherent to diffusion models, but this paper investigates how sampling algorithms and hyperparameters influence bias amplification.

Method: Empirical analysis using controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST, BFFHQ datasets, and Stable Diffusion. Investigates how different sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters affect bias amplification while keeping the trained model fixed.

Result: Sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification. Samplers optimized for sample quality/speed have significant measurable effects on bias amplification. The trained model being fixed doesn't prevent bias manipulation through sampling parameters.

Conclusion: Bias amplification in diffusion models is not just an inherent model characteristic but is significantly influenced by sampling algorithms and hyperparameters, offering new ways to control bias through sampling choices.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

TL;DR: BrainROI model improves multimodal brain decoding by addressing cross-subject generalization and interpretability challenges through functional parcellation-based fMRI encoding, interpretable prompt optimization, and constrained decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal brain decoding faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization (due to heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects) and interpretability (limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency).

Method: 1) New fMRI encoder using multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as shared space with voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism and global label alignment for cross-subject transferability. 2) Interpretable prompt optimization using locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts in small-sample closed loop. 3) Parameterized decoding constraints during inference for improved stability and quality.

Result: Achieves leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on NSD dataset. Under cross-subject setting, shows clear improvements in metrics like BLEU-4 and CIDEr compared to recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines.

Conclusion: BrainROI model successfully addresses cross-subject generalization and interpretability challenges in multimodal brain decoding through innovative fMRI encoding, transparent prompt optimization, and constrained decoding, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

*Maximilian Witte,Johannes Meuer,Étienne Plésiat,Christopher Kadow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Field-Space Attention is a new transformer mechanism for Earth system modeling that computes attention directly on continuous geophysical fields rather than in latent space, preserving geometric structure and enabling physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models for Earth system dynamics often fail to preserve the underlying geometric structure of continuous geophysical fields and lack interpretability, making it difficult to enforce scientific constraints and physical consistency.

Method: Introduces Field-Space attention that operates directly on continuous fields on the sphere, uses fixed non-learned multiscale decomposition, learns structure-preserving deformations, and maintains all intermediate representations as continuous fields.

Result: Field-Space Transformers converge faster and more stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Nets, require fewer parameters, and achieve improved fidelity in global temperature super-resolution tasks on HEALPix grids.

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention provides a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling by explicitly preserving field structure throughout the network.

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

Motivation: Multi-task learning faces challenges in balancing resources and mitigating interference between tasks. Current architectural solutions are often complex with elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes that increase overhead.

Method: Proposes Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TSσBN), a lightweight mechanism that replaces shared normalization with task-specific variants, enabling tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors.

Result: TSσBN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matches or exceeds performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext benchmarks while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Learned gates provide interpretable insights into capacity allocation and task relationships.

Conclusion: Complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary; task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative that effectively addresses multi-task learning challenges.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.
