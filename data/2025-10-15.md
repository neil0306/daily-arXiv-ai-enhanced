### [1] [PHANTOM RECALL: When Familiar Puzzles Fool Smart Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11812)
*Souradeep Mukhopadhyay,Rishabh Baral,Nimeesh Mahajan,Samhitha Harish,Aswin RRV,Mihir Parmar,Mutsumi Nakamura,Chitta Baral*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often fail at genuine reasoning in logic puzzles, relying on memorized solutions instead. When puzzles are perturbed, performance drops dramatically due to 'phantom recall' - reproducing memorized but incorrect answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs genuinely reason or just memorize templates in logic puzzles, and to systematically test their robustness to perturbations that preserve reasoning structure but change surface details.

Method: Created PHANTOM RECALL benchmark with 25 logic puzzles and 149 perturbations, evaluated 11 LLMs, developed automated logical-equivalence judge, taxonomy of reasoning errors, and prompting-based mitigation framework.

Result: LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy on original puzzles but significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting phantom recall and over-elaboration errors.

Conclusion: LLMs often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift, revealing a crucial gap between linguistic fluency and genuine logical understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

### [2] [R-WoM: Retrieval-augmented World Model For Computer-use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11892)
*Kai Mei,Jiang Guo,Shuaichen Chang,Mingwen Dong,Dongkyu Lee,Xing Niu,Jiarong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can serve as world models for agent decision-making but suffer from hallucination and compounding errors in long-horizon simulations. The proposed Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM) addresses these limitations by incorporating external knowledge, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs are suitable for world modeling in digital environments, given their potential to eliminate costly trial-and-error exploration but limitations due to hallucination and static training knowledge.

Method: Probe LLMs' world modeling capabilities through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Then propose R-WoM, which grounds LLM simulations by retrieving factual knowledge from external tutorials.

Result: LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify meaningful state transitions but performance degrades rapidly in full-procedure planning. R-WoM achieves improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

Conclusion: While LLMs have limitations in reliably modeling environment dynamics over long horizons, the retrieval-augmented approach (R-WoM) significantly enhances their world modeling capabilities, especially for longer-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

### [3] [LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11905)
*Patrick Haller,Mark Ibrahim,Polina Kirichenko,Levent Sagun,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' ability to distinguish true from false statements is highly sensitive to superficial input variations like typos or reformulations, revealing that their knowledge representations are shallow and non-robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLM performance is brittle and whether this brittleness stems from unstable internal knowledge representations, particularly testing if truthfulness separability degrades with out-of-distribution samples.

Method: Applied semantically-preserving perturbations (typos, reformulations) to drive statements out-of-distribution, then evaluated representation separability across four LLM families, five datasets, and three knowledge probing methods.

Result: Internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as samples become less similar to pre-training data. LLMs can distinguish true/false statements only when they closely resemble pre-training data, showing high surface form dependency.

Conclusion: LLMs learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations with limited generalizability, challenging the utility of truthfulness probes and calling for improved robustness in learned representations.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

### [4] [LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11919)
*Armel Zebaze,Rachel Bawden,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Intermediate 'thinking tokens' don't improve machine translation performance in large reasoning models, even with fine-tuning using chain of thought explanations. However, combining outputs from modular translation strategies shows benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether generating intermediate thought processes (like chain of thought) helps large reasoning models perform better at machine translation tasks across different language resource levels.

Method: Tested intermediate token generation across multiple language pairs and setups, including fine-tuning models with synthetic CoT explanations and combining outputs from modular translation-specific prompting strategies.

Result: Thinking tokens don't help LRMs perform MT better. Fine-tuning with CoT explanations doesn't outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However, combining outputs from modular translation strategies does improve performance.

Conclusion: The value of intermediate tokens depends on whether they contain actual translation attempts. Using teachers to refine translations or expand corpora is more effective than distilling CoT explanations into thinking models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

### [5] [Discrepancy Detection at the Data Level: Toward Consistent Multilingual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11928)
*Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé,Valérie Aldana,Karla Cantarero,Alonso Madroñal de Mesa,Jerónimo Arenas-García,Jordan Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIND is a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline that detects factual and cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA systems, helping ensure factual consistency across languages while accounting for cultural variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual QA systems need to ensure factual consistency across languages for objective queries while handling cultural variations in subjective responses, particularly for culturally sensitive questions.

Method: Proposed MIND pipeline with user-in-the-loop fact-checking to detect factual and cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases, evaluated on bilingual QA systems in maternal and infant health domain.

Result: MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies in all tested cases, including evaluation on bilingual QA systems and datasets from other domains, demonstrating good generalization capability.

Conclusion: MIND supports development of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems by effectively detecting factual and cultural discrepancies across languages.

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

### [6] [TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944)
*Yupei Li,Philipp Borchert,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopoAlign is a framework that uses code repositories to train Math LLMs for autoformalisation by structurally aligning code components with formal mathematical statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Math LLMs struggle with autoformalisation due to scarcity of large-scale informal-formal statement pairs, and structural differences between code and formal mathematics limit transfer learning from code generation training.

Method: TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and dependency functions, then reassembles these components into analogues that structurally mirror formal statements, creating aligned code data for training without human annotation.

Result: Training DeepSeek-Math with TopoAlign improved performance by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Herald also showed gains of 0.12% on BEq@10 and 1.09% on typecheck@10, demonstrating benefits even for specialized models.

Conclusion: TopoAlign effectively leverages code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs, providing substantial performance improvements in autoformalisation tasks without requiring additional human annotation or new mathematical knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

### [7] [GRAVITY: A Framework for Personalized Text Generation via Profile-Grounded Synthetic Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11952)
*Priyanka Dey,Daniele Rosa,Wenqing Zheng,Daniel Barcklow,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAVITY is a framework that generates synthetic preference data using user profiles to enable scalable LLM personalization without costly human annotations, achieving over 4% preference gains across cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM personalization relies on expensive human feedback or interaction logs, which limits scalability and fails to capture deeper user attributes like interests, values, and personality traits.

Method: Integrates demographic, cultural, and psychological frameworks (Hofstede's dimensions, Schwartz's values, World Values Survey, Big Five OCEAN traits) to synthesize profile-grounded preference pairs for personalized content generation.

Result: Evaluated on 400 Amazon users' book descriptions, GRAVITY outperformed prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic generation, achieving over 4% higher preference gains across cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), with user studies showing 86% preference for GRAVITY outputs.

Conclusion: Profile-grounded synthetic data captures richer user variation, reduces reliance on costly annotation, and produces more engaging user-centered content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

### [8] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable, Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11956)
*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRUMQs, a pipeline for creating uncheatable, realistic, unanswerable, and multi-hop queries to better evaluate RAG systems by addressing limitations in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG benchmarks fail to reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop or out-of-scope questions, often allowing cheating via disconnected reasoning and limiting the ability to uncover RAG system limitations.

Method: The authors developed a pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of CRUMQs (uncheatable, realistic, unanswerable, and multi-hop queries) that is adaptable to any corpus and domain.

Result: CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems, achieving up to 81.0% reduction in cheatability scores compared to prior benchmarks, and were tested on two popular RAG datasets.

Conclusion: The CRUMQs pipeline offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism, driving development of more capable RAG systems by providing better evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [9] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Decoder-only transformers can generate multiple tokens at once using late layers only, achieving 2x speedup without extra parameters or verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early layers handle input context, middle layers do task processing, and late layers convert to output tokens. Hidden states from early/middle layers may contain enough information to generate multiple tokens using only late layers.

Method: Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD) - fine-tune models to generate multiple tokens using only the late layers, eliminating repeated traversal of early and middle layers.

Result: Fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model achieved up to 2x speedup with minor performance loss, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: DMTD shows promising results and performance is expected to improve with larger training datasets, offering efficient inference without additional overhead.

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

### [10] [Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967)
*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding enables LLM agents to manage working context by procedurally branching into subtasks and folding intermediate steps into concise summaries, allowing efficient handling of long-horizon tasks with significantly reduced active context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents are fundamentally constrained by context length on long-horizon tasks, limiting their ability to handle complex multi-step problems.

Method: Developed Context-Folding framework with FoldGRPO reinforcement learning that encourages task decomposition and context management through procedural branching and folding of subtasks.

Result: On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), the folding agent matches or outperforms ReAct baselines while using 10x smaller active context and significantly outperforms summarization-based context management approaches.

Conclusion: Context-Folding provides an effective solution for context management in LLM agents, enabling efficient handling of long-horizon tasks with substantially reduced context requirements.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

### [11] [Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986)
*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConjectureBench to evaluate LLMs' conjecturing ability in autoformalisation, showing current performance is overestimated and proposing Lean-FIRe method to improve end-to-end autoformalisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoformalisation evaluation overlooks the critical conjecturing step that precedes formalisation, making it difficult to assess LLMs' true capabilities in mathematical reasoning.

Method: Created ConjectureBench dataset, redesigned evaluation framework, and developed Lean-FIRe inference-time method to improve conjecturing and autoformalisation.

Result: LLMs' autoformalisation performance is substantially overestimated when conjecturing is accounted for. Lean-FIRe achieved first successful end-to-end autoformalisation of PutnamBench problems (13 with GPT-4.1, 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1).

Conclusion: Conjecturing should be treated as an independent task in autoformalisation, and future research should focus on improving this overlooked step in formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

*Ryan Shea,Yunan Lu,Liang Qiu,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE is a user simulation framework for multi-turn agent evaluation that incorporates business knowledge to create realistic customer personas and interactions, improving evaluation effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing user simulation approaches overlook domain-specific principles and fail to capture realistic user behavior, making multi-turn agent evaluation challenging without human assessment.

Method: SAGE integrates top-down business logic (ideal customer profiles) and bottom-up business infrastructure (product catalogs, FAQs, knowledge bases) to simulate realistic user interactions.

Result: The framework produces more realistic and diverse interactions, identifying up to 33% more agent errors compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: SAGE is an effective evaluation tool that supports bug-finding and iterative agent improvement by grounding user simulation in real business contexts.

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

### [13] [Generate Logical Equivalence Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12001)
*Xinyu Wang,Haoming Yu,Yicheng Yang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an Automatic Question Generation (AQG) system for logical equivalence questions in Discrete Mathematics to combat plagiarism and provide practice questions, using formal language definitions and linear-time algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address academic dishonesty in online learning environments and provide diverse practice questions for students, particularly in foundational computer science courses like Discrete Mathematics.

Method: Defines logical equivalence questions using formal language, translates into generation rules, and develops a linear-time algorithm for question generation.

Result: Student performance on generated questions was comparable to textbook questions, and difficulty levels were similar to both textbook questions and those generated by large language models.

Conclusion: The proposed AQG system successfully generates high-quality logical equivalence questions with appropriate difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for academic integrity and student practice.

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

Motivation: To address the trend of relying solely on LLMs for IE while discarding decades of symbolic/statistical IE experience, and to evaluate the practical trade-offs in real-world agricultural applications.

Method: Comparative evaluation of neuro-symbolic and LLM-based IE systems across nine interviews in pork, dairy, and crop subdomains, measuring performance on total and core information extraction.

Result: LLM-based system outperformed neuro-symbolic approach (F1 total: 69.4 vs 52.7; core: 63.0 vs 47.2), but neuro-symbolic system offered faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks.

Conclusion: Both approaches have significant trade-offs - LLMs offer higher performance and easier deployment but slower runtime and hallucination risks, while neuro-symbolic systems provide control and speed but lack generalizability and require more resources, highlighting the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control in real-world NLP deployments.

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

*Jung-Woo Shim,Yeong-Joon Ju,Ji-Hoon Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CPR is a plug-and-play framework that refines poorly structured prompts to reduce LLM hallucinations by cleaning prompts and generating additional task descriptions using a fine-tuned small language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate plausible but incorrect "hallucinated" facts due to poorly structured or vague user prompts that cause models to base responses on assumed rather than actual intentions.

Method: Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR) framework that: 1) cleans ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions using a fine-tuned small language model to align user intention with prompts.

Result: CPR significantly increases generation quality while mitigating hallucinations. Empirical studies show prompts with CPR achieve over 90% win rate over original prompts without external knowledge.

Conclusion: CPR effectively reduces LLM hallucinations caused by ill-formed prompts through systematic prompt refinement, improving generation quality without requiring external knowledge sources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPR is a multi-stage framework that refines ill-formed prompts using small language models to reduce hallucinations in large language models, achieving over 85% win rate on hallucination benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges with hallucinations, particularly from ill-formed prompts with ambiguous wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, which was relatively underexplored.

Method: Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR) systematically improves prompts across multiple stages addressing specific errors like punctuation, typos, and key term misuse using fine-tuned small language models, with iterative enhancement and self-reflection ranking.

Result: MPR-refined prompts achieve over 85% win rate compared to original forms on hallucination benchmarks, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy.

Conclusion: MPR provides a lightweight, adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across domains and can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

TL;DR: This paper surveys uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), providing foundations, categorization of approaches, empirical results, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs, raising concerns about reliability and trustworthiness in real-world applications. Uncertainty quantification offers principled measures to assess model trustworthiness.

Method: The paper introduces UQ foundations, adapts traditional uncertainty concepts to LLMs, systematically categorizes existing methods along multiple dimensions, and presents empirical results for representative approaches.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive overview of how UQ can be used for hallucination detection in LLMs, identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability through uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The paper outlines current limitations and promising future research directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM uncertainty quantification for hallucination detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

*Ruibo Chen,Jiacheng Pan,Heng Huang,Zhenheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A prompt rewriting framework using LLMs to refine user inputs before T2I generation, improving image-text alignment, quality, and aesthetics without supervised data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models struggle with simple or underspecified prompts, leading to poor image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.

Method: Leverages LLMs with a reward system and iterative DPO training to enhance prompts without supervised fine-tuning data.

Result: Consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics across diverse T2I models, with strong transferability between backbones.

Conclusion: Prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic strategy for improving T2I systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

### [20] [Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12044)
*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hierarchical Alignment applies targeted DPO to different functional blocks (local, intermediate, global layers) instead of treating LLMs as monolithic entities, achieving better performance without alignment tax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard alignment techniques like DPO apply uniform optimization across all layers, overlooking functional specialization in Transformer architecture where different layers handle distinct tasks from syntax to abstract reasoning.

Method: Hierarchical Alignment method applies targeted DPO to distinct functional blocks: local layers (syntax), intermediate layers (logic), and global layers (factuality), using LoRA for surgical fine-tuning on models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B.

Result: Local-Align enhances grammatical fluency; Global-Align improves factual consistency and is most effective for logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. All hierarchical strategies avoid the "alignment tax" where fluency gains degrade logical reasoning.

Conclusion: Hierarchical Alignment establishes a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, shifting from monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning for more advanced and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

*Baisub Lee,Sanghyun Byun,Mohanad Odema,Jung Guack,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APCE is a context-aware method that selects important input chunks through semantic similarity matching to reduce memory footprint and mitigate ContextRot in long-context transformers, achieving comparable summarization performance using only 50%-70% of input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in Long-Context Transformer Models: growing memory footprint from quadratic self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling, and ContextRot performance degradation with increasing context length.

Method: Propose APCE (Adaptive Pre-Computation Elimination) that selects most important input chunks through low-dimensional semantic similarity matching with current query, operating directly on input to be hardware-independent.

Result: Superior or on-par summarization performance compared to full dense baseline while using only 50%-70% of input sequence, achieving significant KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: APCE provides a compatible, scalable solution for long-context tasks that can inspire further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs.

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

*Benjamin W. Nelson,Celeste Wong,Matthew T. Silvestrini,Sooyoon Shin,Alanna Robinson,Jessica Lee,Eric Yang,John Torous,Andrew Trister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) outperforms existing content moderation systems in detecting mental health crises with high sensitivity and specificity, showing robust performance across different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often provide harmful or inappropriate advice in psychiatric emergencies, creating a need for effective safety filters to prevent destructive behaviors.

Method: Evaluated VBHSF on two clinician-labelled datasets (Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset and NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset) and compared performance against OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails.

Result: VBHSF achieved high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) on the Verily dataset, with F1-score of 0.939. On NVIDIA dataset, maintained high sensitivity (0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). Significantly outperformed both comparison systems in sensitivity.

Conclusion: VBHSF demonstrates robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to minimize missed crises, making it suitable for healthcare applications where detecting mental health emergencies is critical.

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

*Ziliang Qiu,Renfen Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PACE is a novel method for evaluating LLM creativity using parallel association chains, addressing data contamination issues and showing strong correlation with human creativity rankings while revealing LLMs still lag behind professional humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM creativity evaluation faces challenges with data contamination in training data and expensive human assessments, creating barriers to progress in this research domain.

Method: PACE (Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate) asks LLMs to generate parallel association chains, providing a straightforward and efficient evaluation method that minimizes data contamination risks.

Result: PACE shows strong correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's ρ=0.739, p<0.001). High-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average humans, but professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Linguistic analysis reveals humans show greater diversity in associative patterns.

Conclusion: PACE provides an effective framework for evaluating LLM creativity with minimal data contamination risk. While LLMs can match average human creativity in associative tasks, they still fall short of professional human performance and exhibit less diverse associative patterns.

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

*Xin Zhao,Naoki Yoshinaga,Yuma Tsuta,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how LLMs acquire multilingual domain knowledge during training, revealing that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging even with high-quality bilingual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms of multilingual knowledge acquisition in LLMs during domain adaptation, as current methods often lead to suboptimal performance in low-resource settings.

Method: Proposes AdaXEval evaluation method using multiple-choice QA datasets from bilingual domain corpus, and conducts continual training experiments with diverse data recipes on a 13B English-Japanese LLM.

Result: Cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite using high-quality bilingual corpus, indicating limitations in current multilingual domain adaptation approaches.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how LLMs transform domain training data into knowledge and highlights the persistent challenges in cross-lingual knowledge transfer during multilingual domain adaptation.

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

*Bajian Xiang,Shuaijiang Zhao,Tingwei Guo,Wei Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the modality gap between speech and text inputs in Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs), revealing that while speech-text alignment training improves conversational abilities, it creates performance disparities in semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSLMs show impressive conversational generation but consistently underperform traditional pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks, creating a need to understand and address the modality gap between speech and text inputs.

Method: Systematic experimentation analyzing coarse- and fine-grained text/speech representations, introducing Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment, and designing interventions through angle projection and length normalization on critical tokens.

Result: Found that speech and text representations align in direction but diverge in magnitude in deeper layers, with representation similarity strongly correlated with modality gap. Token-level alignment patterns were observed, and targeted interventions showed potential to improve speech input correctness.

Conclusion: This study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization through better understanding of representation alignment patterns.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafeMT benchmark introduced for evaluating multi-modal LLM safety in multi-turn dialogues, showing increased attack success with more turns and proposing a dialogue safety moderator for better protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety benchmarks don't adequately address multi-turn dialogues which pose greater risks in everyday interactions with MLLMs.

Method: Created SafeMT benchmark with 10,000 samples across 17 scenarios and 4 jailbreak methods, and proposed Safety Index (SI) for evaluation. Also developed a dialogue safety moderator to detect malicious intent in conversations.

Result: Testing 17 models revealed that attack success rate increases with more dialogue turns, indicating inadequate safety mechanisms. The proposed moderator reduces multi-turn ASR more effectively than existing guard models.

Conclusion: Current MLLM safety mechanisms are insufficient for multi-turn dialogues, and the proposed dialogue safety moderator provides better protection against concealed malicious intent in conversations.

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song,Jiajie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Credal Transformer to address LLM hallucinations by replacing standard attention with Credal Attention Mechanism that produces credal sets to quantify uncertainty and reduce confident errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate factually incorrect but confident assertions (hallucinations), which stems from Transformer's Softmax function creating 'Artificial Certainty' by collapsing ambiguous attention scores into single distributions.

Method: Replace standard attention with Credal Attention Mechanism based on evidential theory, producing credal sets (sets of distributions) instead of single attention vectors. Implement by re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for Dirichlet distribution.

Result: Credal Transformer identifies out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining.

Conclusion: Provides a new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model for more reliable AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Motivation: To address the fragility of standard sequential reasoning methods in LLMs and improve practical performance through parallel reasoning approaches that explore multiple lines of thought concurrently.

Method: The authors provide a formal definition of parallel reasoning, distinguish it from related concepts like Chain-of-Thought, organize techniques using a taxonomy (non-interactive reasoning, interactive reasoning, efficiency-focused decoding), and analyze various application scenarios.

Result: A comprehensive survey that categorizes parallel reasoning methods, explores applications in complex problem-solving and reliability enhancement, and identifies core challenges in the field.

Conclusion: The survey provides a roadmap for beginners and encourages further research to improve parallel reasoning methods, highlighting current challenges and potential future directions in this emerging field.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

### [29] [Towards Inference-time Scaling for Continuous Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12167)
*Minghan Wang,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Shareghi,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates adapting inference-time scaling techniques from discrete text reasoning to continuous space reasoning using COCONUT LM, finding potential performance gains but highlighting unique challenges in training effective reward models for discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether established inference-time scaling techniques (multiple sample generation with PRM/ORM re-ranking) that work well for text-based reasoning can be successfully adapted to continuous space reasoning.

Method: Used COCONUT continuous space reasoning LM as backbone, generated diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling, conducted Pass@N analysis, and probed geometric properties and trajectory dynamics to understand challenges.

Result: Found potential for significant performance gains similar to discrete space, but identified unique challenges: existing discrete-space recipes for data generation and training PRM/ORM models yield only marginal improvements in continuous space due to inability to effectively discriminate correct vs incorrect reasoning.

Conclusion: Current limitations stem from absence of key inductive biases in continuous thought representations. Training frameworks for continuous reasoning LMs need to not only optimize for accuracy but also explicitly incorporate inductive biases that enable effective discrimination during inference.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

### [30] [From Knowledge to Treatment: Large Language Model Assisted Biomedical Concept Representation for Drug Repurposing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12181)
*Chengrui Xiang,Tengfei Ma,Xiangzheng Fu,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaDR is a framework that uses large language models to enhance biomedical knowledge graphs for drug repurposing by injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into knowledge graph embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drug repurposing methods overlook common-sense biomedical knowledge like mechanistic priors about drug-treatment incompatibilities, creating a gap in representing real-world clinical knowledge.

Method: Extract semantically enriched textual representations of biomedical entities from LLMs and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding models to inject treatment-relevant knowledge.

Result: LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different scenarios in benchmarks, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves biomedical concept representation in knowledge graphs, enhancing semantic understanding of complex indications for drug repurposing.

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

### [31] [Not in Sync: Unveiling Temporal Bias in Audio Chat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12185)
*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Rundong Cheng,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Zhen Xiong,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic study reveals temporal bias in Large Audio Language Models' timestamp predictions, showing consistent early/late errors that worsen with audio length and vary by event type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Audio Language Models are increasingly used for audio understanding but their ability to accurately locate when events occur remains underexplored, particularly systematic timing errors.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments on timestamped datasets, developed Temporal Bias Index (TBI) to quantify systematic misalignment, and created visualization framework.

Result: Found temporal bias is prevalent across datasets/models, increases with audio length (accumulating to tens of seconds), and varies by event types and positions.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental limitation in current LALMs' temporal localization capabilities, calling for development of temporally robust architectures.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

### [32] [DPO-Tuned Large Language Models for Segmentation in Simultaneous Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12195)
*Zeyu Yang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a segmentation framework using LLMs trained with DPO for simultaneous speech translation, achieving better segmentation accuracy and translation quality than SHAS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models like SHAS lack human preference alignment crucial for natural real-time interpretation, being constrained by supervised learning objectives.

Method: Uses large language models trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to predict natural segmentation points, evaluated with SeamlessM4T v2 on ACL 60/60 corpus across three language pairs.

Result: DPO-tuned LLM achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS, with consistent improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) and latency (Average Lagging).

Conclusion: Preference-tuned LLMs can surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive, human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

### [33] [HALF: Harm-Aware LLM Fairness Evaluation Aligned with Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12217)
*Ali Mekky,Omar El Herraoui,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HALF is a harm-aware fairness framework that evaluates LLM bias across real-world applications weighted by harm severity, revealing deployment gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM fairness evaluations lack real-world grounding and don't account for differences in harm severity across domains like medical decisions vs. text summarization.

Method: HALF organizes nine application domains into three severity tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline that assesses bias in realistic scenarios weighted by harm impact.

Result: Evaluation across eight LLMs shows: (1) inconsistent fairness across domains, (2) no correlation between model size/performance and fairness, (3) reasoning models perform better in medical but worse in education domains.

Conclusion: HALF exposes a significant gap between previous benchmarking success and actual deployment readiness for LLMs in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

### [34] [Analysing Moral Bias in Finetuned LLMs through Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12229)
*Bianca Raimondi,Daniela Dalbagno,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study shows that moral biases like the Knobe effect emerge in finetuned LLMs and can be localized to specific layers, with targeted patching eliminating the bias without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how human-like biases manifest in LLMs during finetuning and investigate whether specific moral biases like the Knobe effect can be traced to particular model components.

Method: Conducted Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs to localize where the Knobe effect bias emerges and test whether patching activations from pretrained models into critical layers can eliminate the bias.

Result: The Knobe effect bias is learned during finetuning and localized to specific layers. Patching activations from pretrained models into just a few critical layers successfully eliminated the bias.

Conclusion: Social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions without requiring model retraining, offering a practical approach to bias reduction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

### [35] [DSAS: A Universal Plug-and-Play Framework for Attention Optimization in Multi-Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12251)
*Jiakai Li,Rongzheng Wang,Yizhuo Ma,Shuang Liang,Guangchun Luo,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSAS is a plug-and-play solution that addresses LLMs' limitations in multi-document QA through two modules: CGW to alleviate 'lost-in-the-middle' issues and RAS to enhance long-range dependency modeling, achieving 4.2% average F1-score improvement without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-document QA due to long-range dependency modeling issues and the 'lost-in-the-middle' problem where they fail to process information in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions are either limited or require costly finetuning.

Method: Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) with two modules: Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) assesses paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and position-aware weighting; Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS) suppresses information exchange between key and irrelevant texts.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show DSAS improves average F1-score by 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, with effectiveness across mainstream LLMs including Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek.

Conclusion: DSAS provides a universal and simple plug-and-play solution that effectively addresses LLMs' limitations in multi-document QA without requiring architectural modifications or extra training parameters, demonstrating robustness and scalability.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

*Blazej Manczak,Eric Lin,Francisco Eiras,James O' Neill,Vaikkunth Mugunthan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedQA-Followup framework evaluates multi-turn robustness of LLMs in medical QA, revealing severe vulnerabilities where accuracy drops dramatically under contextual interventions, especially indirect ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks focus on single-turn QA under ideal conditions, overlooking real-world medical consultation complexities like conflicting input, misleading context, and authority influence.

Method: Introduced MedQA-Followup framework with controlled interventions on MedQA dataset, distinguishing shallow vs deep robustness and indirect vs direct interventions, evaluating five state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Models perform reasonably under shallow perturbations but show severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5%. Counterintuitively, indirect context-based interventions are more harmful than direct suggestions.

Conclusion: Multi-turn robustness is a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable deployment of medical LLMs, requiring focused attention for clinical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

### [37] [Chinese ModernBERT with Whole-Word Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12285)
*Zeyu Zhao,Ningtao Wang,Xing Fu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT is a new Chinese encoder that improves tokenization, training methods, and architecture to achieve better performance on Chinese NLP tasks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder improvements haven't fully transferred to Chinese due to differences in tokenization and morphology from English, creating a need for optimized Chinese-specific models.

Method: Uses hardware-aware 32k BPE vocabulary with Chinese affixes/compounds, whole-word masking with dynamic curriculum, two-stage pre-training with extended context (1,024 to 8,192 tokens), and damped-cosine learning rate schedule.

Result: Competitive with strong Chinese encoders on CLUE, achieves high long-sequence throughput while maintaining short-sequence speed, and surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding on SimCLUE with additional contrastive data.

Conclusion: The approach provides a clear scaling path for Chinese language models and demonstrates effective optimization for Chinese-specific characteristics in tokenization, training, and architecture.

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

TL;DR: An unsupervised pipeline using LLMs for automated grammatical annotation in large corpora, achieving 98%+ accuracy on 143,933 sentences from COHA in under 60 hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation is a major bottleneck in corpus linguistics as corpora expand rapidly, creating need for scalable automated solutions.

Method: Four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation using GPT-5 through OpenAI API.

Result: Successfully annotated 143,933 sentences from COHA with 98%+ accuracy on sophisticated annotation procedures, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: LLMs can perform data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention, opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though requiring attention to costs, licensing, and ethical considerations.

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

*Greta Damo,Elena Cabrio,Serena Villata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for counter-speech generation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a knowledge base from UN and EU sources, outperforming standard LLMs in generating trustworthy counter-speech for 8 target groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counter-speech generation approaches have limitations - LLMs lack reliability/coherence, while NGO experts lack scalability. Need for trustworthy, knowledge-based counter-speech generation.

Method: Model counter-speech as knowledge-wise text generation using RAG pipelines. Built knowledge base from UN Digital Library, EUR-Lex, and EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (32,792 texts). Targets 8 groups: women, people of color, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and others.

Result: Outperformed standard LLM baselines and competitive approaches on both automated metrics (JudgeLM) and human evaluation. Framework generates more trustworthy counter-speech.

Conclusion: The framework and knowledge base enable trustworthy counter-speech generation for hate speech and beyond, addressing reliability and scalability issues of existing methods.

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fine-grained input attribution method reveals that brain-LLM alignment and next-word prediction rely on different word subsets, with NWP focusing on syntax and recency/primacy biases, while BA prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational principles of language processing by examining the alignment between LLMs and human brain activity, specifically addressing the contentious relationship between brain alignment and next-word prediction.

Method: Introduced a fine-grained input attribution method to identify specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and applied it to compare brain alignment and next-word prediction.

Result: BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP shows recency and primacy biases with syntax focus, while BA prioritizes semantic and discourse information with targeted recency effect.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of how LLMs relate to human language processing and highlights feature reliance differences between BA and NWP. The attribution method can be broadly applied to explore cognitive relevance in diverse language tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoBiLE is a plug-and-play MoE inference framework that uses mixture of big-little experts to accelerate inference while maintaining model quality, achieving 1.6-1.72x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE offloading approaches suffer from CPU-GPU bandwidth limitations and prefetching methods have high training overhead and reduced effectiveness on modern fine-grained MoE models.

Method: Proposes MoBiLE with mixture of big-little experts - reduces experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while keeping full experts for important tokens, plus dedicated fallback/prefetching mechanism for switching between little and big experts.

Result: Achieves 1.60x to 1.72x speedup compared to baseline on consumer GPU system with negligible degradation in accuracy across four modern MoE architectures and challenging generative tasks.

Conclusion: MoBiLE provides an effective plug-and-play solution for MoE inference acceleration that balances performance and model quality through intelligent expert management.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

TL;DR: LLMs integrated into both research and peer review processes create systematic biases favoring LLM-authored papers and penalizing human-authored critical content, raising fairness concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the risks of LLM integration in academic workflows, particularly how LLMs as reviewers may affect scholarly fairness through their dual roles in research and review.

Method: Simulation with research agent generating/revising papers and review agent assessing submissions, followed by human annotations to compare LLM-based reviews with human judgments.

Result: LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers and persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements, due to linguistic feature bias and aversion to critical content.

Conclusion: LLMs in peer review pose significant fairness risks but can help improve paper quality, suggesting need for caution in deployment while recognizing potential benefits for early-stage researchers.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

### [43] [Tokenization Disparities as Infrastructure Bias: How Subword Systems Create Inequities in LLM Access and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12389)
*Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot,Wolfgang Nejdl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale study reveals systematic tokenization disparities across 200+ languages, showing Latin-script languages have higher efficiency while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages face 3-5x higher computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization disparities create barriers to equitable AI access across linguistically diverse populations, requiring systematic quantification of computational inequities in LLMs.

Method: Standardized experimental framework with consistent preprocessing, normalization protocols, and uniform tokenization using tiktoken library across 200+ languages, evaluating with Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC) metrics.

Result: Substantial systematic disparities: Latin-script languages show higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages have significantly greater token inflation with 3-5 times higher RTC ratios, leading to increased computational costs and reduced context utilization.

Conclusion: Current AI systems exhibit structural inequities disadvantaging speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages; future research should prioritize linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction for more inclusive multilingual AI.

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

*Xiangjun Zai,Xingyu Tan,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRoH is a dynamic framework for planning and reasoning over knowledge hypergraphs that addresses limitations of static retrieval planning, non-adaptive execution, and superficial structure use in existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multi-hop question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge hypergraph-based RAG methods suffer from static retrieval planning, non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and semantics, limiting their effectiveness in multi-hop question answering.

Method: PRoH incorporates three innovations: (1) context-aware planning module for structurally grounded reasoning plans, (2) structured question decomposition as a dynamic DAG for adaptive multi-trajectory exploration, and (3) Entity-Weighted Overlap-guided reasoning path retrieval algorithm for semantically coherent hyperedge traversals.

Result: PRoH achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior SOTA model HyperGraphRAG by 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PRoH effectively overcomes limitations of existing KH-based RAG methods through dynamic planning and reasoning, demonstrating superior performance in multi-hop question answering across multiple domains.

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

*Linfeng Gao,Baolong Bi,Zheng Yuan,Le Wang,Zerui Chen,Zhimin Wei,Shenghua Liu,Qinggang Zhang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR is a framework that improves RAG faithfulness by localizing knowledge conflicts through hidden-state probing and conflict-aware fine-tuning, addressing the issue where LLM responses contradict retrieved evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems suffer from unfaithfulness where model responses contradict retrieved context, and current approaches treat LLMs as black boxes without understanding how they internally integrate evidence during knowledge conflicts.

Method: Proposed CLEAR framework: (1) decomposes context into sentence-level knowledge, (2) uses hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge, and (3) applies conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide accurate evidence integration.

Result: Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under diverse conflict conditions.

Conclusion: CLEAR effectively addresses RAG unfaithfulness by understanding and mitigating knowledge conflicts through fine-grained analysis and targeted fine-tuning, providing a more faithful integration of retrieved evidence.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

### [46] [Resource-sensitive but language-blind: Community size and not grammatical complexity better predicts the accuracy of Large Language Models in a novel Wug Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12463)
*Nikoleta Pantelidou,Evelina Leivada,Paolo Morosi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show human-like accuracy in morphological generalization tasks but performance is driven more by training data quantity than linguistic complexity, with better results for high-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' linguistic abilities approximate human competence and whether performance is shaped by linguistic complexity or training data quantity.

Method: Used multilingual Wug Test across four languages (Catalan, English, Greek, Spanish) to test morphological generalization with novel words, comparing six models with human speakers.

Result: Models generalized morphological processes with human-like accuracy, but accuracy patterns aligned more with community size and data availability than structural complexity - better performance for high-resource languages like Spanish and English.

Conclusion: Model behavior is primarily driven by linguistic resource richness rather than grammatical complexity sensitivity, resulting in only superficial resemblance to human linguistic competence.

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

*Biao Zhang,Lixin Chen,Tong Liu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMEC is a training framework that compresses high-dimensional LLM embeddings while maintaining performance through sequential matryoshka representation learning, adaptive dimension selection, and cross-batch memory modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional LLM embeddings cause computational complexity and storage issues that hinder practical deployment, requiring efficient compression methods.

Method: Proposes Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC) with three components: Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning (SMRL) to reduce gradient variance, Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) to minimize information loss during pruning, and Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) to enhance unsupervised learning between different dimensional embeddings.

Result: SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. On BEIR dataset, it improves compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points over Matryoshka-Adaptor and 2.7 points over Search-Adaptor models.

Conclusion: The SMEC framework effectively addresses the computational and storage challenges of high-dimensional LLM embeddings through a comprehensive training approach that preserves semantic information during compression.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

*Lang Gao,Xuhui Li,Chenxi Wang,Mingzhe Li,Wei Liu,Zirui Song,Jinghui Zhang,Rui Yan,Preslav Nakov,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first benchmark for personalized machine-generated text detection and identifies the 'feature-inversion trap' where detectors fail in personalized settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can now generate text that imitates personal writing styles, creating risks of identity impersonation, but no prior work has examined personalized MGT detection.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset from literary/blog texts with LLM-generated imitations, and proposed a method to predict detector performance changes by identifying latent directions of inverted features.

Result: Found large performance gaps in personalized settings, with some state-of-the-art detectors suffering significant drops. The proposed method achieved 85% correlation with actual performance gaps.

Conclusion: The work highlights the vulnerability of current detectors in personalized settings and provides a framework to evaluate and predict their performance, encouraging further research in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend test-time scaling techniques beyond domains with verifiably correct answers (like mathematics and coding) to LeWiDi-2025 tasks that involve evaluating annotation disagreements.

Method: Three test-time scaling methods were tested: Model Averaging, Majority Voting, and Best-of-N sampling on the LeWiDi-2025 tasks.

Result: Model Averaging and Majority Voting consistently improved LLM performance on LeWiDi tasks, but Best-of-N sampling did not show improvements.

Conclusion: Best-of-N method does not currently transfer effectively from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and further analysis is needed to understand this performance gap.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

*Stella Frank,Emily Allaway*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs face tension between pragmatic priors (assuming congruent text-image inputs) and semantic priors (general category knowledge) when evaluating atypical instances, leading to degraded conceptual understanding with incongruent images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Vision Language Models trade off between pragmatic priors (from finetuning on congruent inputs) and semantic priors (general conceptual knowledge) when dealing with atypical evaluation instances.

Method: Created VISaGE dataset with both typical and exceptional images, and conducted carefully balanced experiments to test VLM performance under congruent and incongruent conditions.

Result: Conceptual understanding degrades when the pragmatic prior's congruency assumption is violated with incongruent images, with this effect being stronger than the semantic prior effect for individual instances.

Conclusion: VLMs prioritize pragmatic priors over semantic priors when evaluating individual instances, leading to performance degradation when faced with incongruent inputs that violate the expected text-image alignment.

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

*Bryan Eikema,Evgenia Ilia,José G. C. de Souza,Chrysoula Zerva,Wilker Aziz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FUT is a fine-tuning method that teaches LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully by aligning verbal hedges with answer consistency, reducing the faithfulness gap without changing answer distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often miscommunicate uncertainty - they give divergent answers to repeated queries but present responses as certain, creating a faithfulness gap in their knowledge representation.

Method: Fine-tuning approach that augments model samples with uncertainty hedges (verbal cues like 'possibly', 'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no external supervision.

Result: FUT substantially reduces the faithfulness gap while preserving QA accuracy and introducing minimal semantic distribution shift across multiple models and datasets.

Conclusion: FUT is a simple and effective method to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully, demonstrating robustness across various decoding strategies and uncertainty expression forms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

TL;DR: StyleDecipher is a robust and explainable framework for detecting LLM-generated text using combined feature extractors to quantify stylistic differences between human and machine writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods struggle with limited generalization, vulnerability to paraphrasing, and lack of explainability in real-world scenarios with stylistic diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship.

Method: Jointly models discrete stylistic indicators and continuous stylistic representations from semantic embeddings to capture style-level divergences in a unified representation space, without requiring model internals or labeled segments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy across five domains (news, code, essays, reviews, academic abstracts) and surpasses existing baselines by up to 36.30% in cross-domain evaluations, while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and mixed content.

Conclusion: Stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for distinguishing machine-generated text, enabling accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality parallel datasets specifically for academic translation and enable better machine translation in academic domains.

Method: Created ACADATA dataset with training and evaluation subsets, then fine-tuned LLMs on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmarked against various translation systems.

Result: Fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN improved academic translation by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points for 7B and 2B models, with top model surpassing proprietary and open-weight models.

Conclusion: ACADATA provides valuable resources for advancing academic domain and long-context translation research, with released datasets and models benefiting the community.

Abstract: We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation,
that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5
million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and
ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12
directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models
(LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized
machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several
large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that
fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality
by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively,
while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to
24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model
surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation
domain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we
provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic
domain and long-context translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COSTAR-A is an enhanced prompt engineering framework that adds 'Answer' to the original COSTAR method, improving output structure and decisiveness for smaller LLMs, especially Llama 3.1-8B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt design, and existing prompting techniques like COSTAR show inconsistent performance with smaller, locally optimized models that require more directive outputs.

Method: Developed COSTAR-A by adding 'Answer' component to COSTAR framework, then conducted controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller models (≤8B parameters) to evaluate effectiveness.

Result: COSTAR-A enhances output structure and decisiveness for localized LLMs, with Llama 3.1-8B showing performance improvements, though effectiveness varies across models and use cases.

Conclusion: COSTAR-A is an adaptable and scalable prompting framework particularly valuable for computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

*Chaoxu Pang,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARO enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with task-specific reasoning patterns without human annotations, achieving comparable performance to human rationales that are 10x larger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human rationale annotation for SFT+RLVR is prohibitively expensive, especially for patterned reasoning tasks where reasoning follows consistent procedural strategies across instances.

Method: Propose PARO framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with task-specific reasoning patterns without human annotations, using limited human supervision over patterns.

Result: PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger, demonstrating effective replacement of human annotations.

Conclusion: Large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

*Sunny Yu,Ahmad Jabbar,Robert Hawkins,Dan Jurafsky,Myra Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Generation Space Size (GSS) to address LLM miscalibration issues - overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinated diverse outputs for factual tasks. It presents GSSBench for evaluation and shows that hallucination detection metrics outperform standard diversity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are miscalibrated: they produce overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. These failure modes can be unified and addressed through the concept of effective generation space size.

Method: Proposes Generation Space Size (GSS) concept and GSSBench, a task suite with prompt pairs having ground-truth GSS relationships. Evaluates various metrics including hallucination detection metrics like EigenScore against standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics.

Result: Hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics. These metrics use only model internals and provide interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.

Conclusion: GSS has three key applications: detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions, interpreting overthinking/underthinking in reasoning models, and steering models to expand their generation space for high-quality diverse outputs.

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

### [57] [Omni-Captioner: Data Pipeline, Models, and Benchmark for Omni Detailed Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12720)
*Ziyang Ma,Ruiyang Xu,Zhenghao Xing,Yunfei Chu,Yuxuan Wang,Jinzheng He,Jin Xu,Pheng-Ann Heng,Kai Yu,Junyang Lin,Eng Siong Chng,Xie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Omni-Detective, a framework for improving fine-grained multimodal perception in Omni Language Models (OLMs) through a novel data generation pipeline, specialized captioning models, and a dedicated evaluation benchmark called Omni-Cloze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OLMs have limited capacity for capturing fine-grained details in audio-visual content, and there's an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination that needs to be addressed for richer human-AI interaction.

Method: Proposed Omni-Detective - an agentic data generation pipeline using tool-calling to produce detailed multimodal data with minimal hallucination. Trained two models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only perception and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual perception. Also designed Omni-Cloze benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Audio-Captioner achieved best performance on MMAU and MMAR benchmarks, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. Omni-Captioner set new SOTA on VDC and achieved best detail-hallucination trade-off on video-SALMONN 2. Omni-Cloze proved effective for stable evaluation.

Conclusion: The Omni-Detective framework successfully addresses the detail-hallucination trade-off in OLMs and enables superior fine-grained multimodal perception, with the proposed evaluation benchmark providing reliable assessment of detailed captioning capabilities.

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

### [58] [Which Word Orders Facilitate Length Generalization in LMs? An Investigation with GCG-Based Artificial Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12722)
*Nadine El-Naggar,Tatsuki Kuribayashi,Ted Briscoe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper extends previous work on language model inductive biases by using Generalized Categorial Grammar to create more natural artificial languages and testing generalization to longer sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models have inductive biases favoring typologically frequent grammatical properties over rare ones, building on previous artificial language studies.

Method: Extended context-free artificial languages using Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) to cover attested constructions like unbounded dependencies and mildly context-sensitive structures. Focused evaluation on generalization ability to process unseen longer test sentences.

Result: Typologically plausible word orders tend to be easier for language models to productively generalize.

Conclusion: The improved artificial languages better capture natural language features and the experimental paradigm provides clearer evidence that language models favor typologically plausible grammatical structures.

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

### [59] [Hey, wait a minute: on at-issue sensitivity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12740)
*Sanghee J. Kim,Kanishka Misra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGRC, a method to evaluate dialogue naturalness in language models using the linguistic concept of 'at-issueness', finding that models prefer continuing at-issue content and modulate this preference with contextual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating dialogue naturalness in language models is challenging due to varying notions of naturalness and limited scalable metrics.

Method: Divide, Generate, Recombine, and Compare (DGRC): divides dialogue prompts, generates continuations for subparts, recombines sequences, and compares likelihoods.

Result: LMs prefer continuing at-issue content (enhanced in instruct-tuned models) and reduce this preference when relevant cues are present, though instruct-tuning doesn't amplify modulation.

Conclusion: The pattern of at-issue preference modulation reflects successful dialogue dynamics, providing a systematic way to test discourse-sensitive behavior in LMs.

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

*Łukasz Borchmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues against speculative linguistic critiques of LLMs based on de Saussure and Chomsky's theories, proposing instead an empiricist framework from Witold Mańczak that defines language as the totality of all spoken/written content governed by frequency of use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unproductive speculative critiques of LLMs that question their legitimacy as language models based on theoretical frameworks requiring "deep structure" or "grounding" for linguistic "competence".

Method: Adopts Witold Mańczak's empiricist linguistic framework which defines language as the totality of all that is said and written, with frequency of use as the primary governing principle.

Result: Provides a constructive alternative perspective that challenges prior critiques of LLMs and offers practical guidance for designing, evaluating, and interpreting language models.

Conclusion: A radical shift to empiricist principles focusing on actual language use and frequency provides a more productive framework for understanding and working with LLMs than speculative theoretical critiques.

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

*Ahmed Heakl,Martin Gubri,Salman Khan,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dr.LLM is a dynamic routing framework that enables pretrained LLMs to skip, execute, or repeat transformer layers per token, improving efficiency while maintaining or enhancing accuracy through explicitly supervised router training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs process all tokens through all layers, wasting computation on simple queries and lacking flexibility for complex reasoning tasks that may require deeper processing.

Method: Uses lightweight per-layer routers trained with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to derive optimal layer configurations under compute budgets, with windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers.

Result: Achieves up to +3.4% accuracy improvement on ARC and DART while saving 5 layers per example on average, generalizes to out-of-domain tasks with only 0.85% accuracy drop, and outperforms prior routing methods by up to +7.7%.

Conclusion: Dr.LLM demonstrates that explicitly supervised routers can retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without modifying base model weights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Motivation: Understanding the actual human labor costs for creating speech datasets for low-resource languages, particularly predominantly oral languages with low literacy rates.

Method: One-month field study with 10 native transcribers correcting ASR-generated transcriptions of 53 hours of Bambara voice data, comparing laboratory vs field conditions.

Result: Average transcription time: 30 hours per hour of speech in lab conditions, 36 hours in field conditions.

Conclusion: Provides baseline cost estimates and practical insights for creating NLP resources for similar low-resource oral languages.

Abstract: Creating speech datasets for low-resource languages is a critical yet poorly
understood challenge, particularly regarding the actual cost in human labor.
This paper investigates the time and complexity required to produce
high-quality annotated speech data for a subset of low-resource languages, low
literacy Predominately Oral Languages, focusing on Bambara, a Manding language
of Mali. Through a one-month field study involving ten transcribers with native
proficiency, we analyze the correction of ASR-generated transcriptions of 53
hours of Bambara voice data. We report that it takes, on average, 30 hours of
human labor to accurately transcribe one hour of speech data under laboratory
conditions and 36 hours under field conditions. The study provides a baseline
and practical insights for a large class of languages with comparable profiles
undertaking the creation of NLP resources.

TL;DR: Method to improve 3D lunar maps from Kaguya TC images by reducing compression-induced noise in disparity maps, enhancing elevation accuracy for long-distance rover missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D lunar maps are critical for long-distance missions like NASA's Endurance rover traversing 2,000 km, but Kaguya TC images suffer from altitude inaccuracies due to stereo matching errors and JPEG compression artifacts.

Method: Analyze compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, identify systematic disparity noise patterns in darker regions, and propose approach to reduce residual noise in disparity images derived from compressed images.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing terrain data quality.

Conclusion: The method improves safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions by mitigating compression-induced noise in 3D maps.

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's advantage over DINO in vision-language models stems from language supervision enabling better semantic understanding, not just larger training data, with CLIP excelling at text-intensive tasks while DINO performs slightly better on vision-centric ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether CLIP's superior performance over self-supervised models like DINO in vision-language models comes from language supervision or larger training data.

Method: Pre-trained CLIP and DINO under controlled settings with same architecture, dataset, and training configuration, then analyzed embeddings and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks.

Result: CLIP captures high-level semantics (object categories, text) while DINO responds more to low-level features. CLIP excels at text-intensive VQA tasks, DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Language supervision variants provided limited gains.

Conclusion: Language supervision in CLIP enables better semantic understanding crucial for vision-language models, providing scientific insights for vision encoder design.

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

Conclusion: The dual-model framework with separate task training effectively leverages complementary model strengths for traffic safety analysis, demonstrating superior performance over joint training approaches through minimized task interference and specialized optimization.

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net is a novel model for estimating 3D room layouts from single panorama images using CNN and Thin Plate Spline transformation in a two-stage architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D room layout estimation is crucial for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and interior design, requiring methods that can handle both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Method: Two-stage architecture: 1) CNN extracts high-level features and learns TPS transformation parameters, 2) TPS spatial transformation warps reference layout to predicted layout using learned parameters.

Result: Achieved 3DIoU values of 85.49 (PanoContext), 86.16 (Stanford-2D3D), 81.76 (Matterport3DLayout), and 91.98 (ZInD), demonstrating robustness for both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Conclusion: The model effectively combines TPS transformation with panorama images, showing high accuracy and generalization capability across different room layout types.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,

TL;DR: A spatial reasoning framework that embeds bounding box coordinates in prompts to improve spatial understanding in warehouse environments, achieving 4th place on the AI City Challenge leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments like warehouses due to scene clutter, occlusions, and lack of explicit spatial grounding.

Method: Embed mask dimensions (bounding box coordinates) directly into input prompts, fine-tune across four question categories with task-specific supervision, and append normalized answers to GPT responses for evaluation consistency.

Result: Achieved a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard of the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge.

Conclusion: Structured prompt enrichment with geometric information and targeted optimization effectively advances spatial reasoning capabilities for real-world industrial environments.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial

TL;DR: This study evaluates Vision Transformer explainability methods (Grad-CAM and Gradient Attention Rollout) for medical imaging tasks, finding DINO with Grad-CAM provides the most faithful and localized explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability is crucial for clinical trust in medical imaging AI. Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance but their complex attention mechanisms pose explainability challenges.

Method: Evaluated ViT, DeiT, DINO, and Swin Transformer architectures with Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM on peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound classification tasks using quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Result: DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout yields scattered activations. Even in misclassifications, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant morphological features.

Conclusion: The research supports reliable and explainable integration of Vision Transformers into medical diagnostic workflows by improving model transparency, with DINO and Grad-CAM providing optimal explainability.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model

*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet is an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network that addresses underwater camouflaged object detection by integrating Siamese architecture with prior-guided mechanisms to handle image degradation and marine organism camouflage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with underwater image degradation (low contrast, color distortion) and fail to adapt terrestrial camouflaged object detection approaches to underwater environments due to lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.

Method: Uses MSRCR algorithm for data augmentation to generate illumination-invariant images, designs Extended Receptive Field module with Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder for multi-scale context, and implements adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary priors using spatial attention and deformable convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public MAS datasets show APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods under widely used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: APGNet effectively addresses the challenges of underwater camouflaged object detection by combining illumination-invariant preprocessing, multi-scale feature extraction, and adaptive prior guidance for improved robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidMP3 is a novel video editing method that preserves original motion while allowing structural and semantic flexibility in swapped objects, addressing limitations of existing diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods struggle with temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and require human intervention when handling structure-variable editing scenarios, creating a need for more flexible motion-preserved editing solutions.

Method: Leverages pose and position priors to learn generalized motion representations from source videos, enabling generation of new videos that maintain original motion while allowing structural and semantic changes.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate superiority over existing methods in maintaining motion consistency while enabling flexible structural and semantic editing.

Conclusion: VidMP3 effectively addresses key challenges in motion-preserved video editing and enables more flexible object swapping while maintaining temporal consistency and motion fidelity.

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to overcome the scarcity of good quality labeled data in computer vision, which is often difficult to obtain due to high human labor costs and sometimes impossible to acquire.

Method: The paper discusses Domain Adaptation methods, which involve using a model trained on one dataset to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind (e.g., model trained on paintings predicting real images).

Result: The paper aims to produce results comparable to previous benchmark results despite data scarcity through domain adaptation techniques.

Conclusion: Domain Adaptation provides a solution to the data scarcity problem in computer vision by enabling models to generalize across different domains without requiring extensive labeled data from the target domain.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character audio-driven video generation.

Conclusion: Proposes an efficient and cost-effective solution for lifelike talking video generation with improved lip synchronization and multi-character support.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective

### [75] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer) and Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet) for QR code deblurring, focusing on decoding success rather than perceptual quality, with explicit edge priors and adaptive network selection based on blur severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods rarely exploit the explicit edge priors in QR codes' highly structured patterns, and general image deblurring prioritizes perceptual quality over decoding success.

Method: Developed Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB) to embed explicit edge priors into Transformer architecture, created EG-Restormer for severe blur and Lightweight Efficient Network (LENet) for mild blur, integrated into Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet) that dynamically selects network based on blur severity.

Result: EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve state-of-the-art performance with competitive speed, significantly boosting decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively leverage QR code structural priors and adaptive network selection for practical mobile deployment, achieving superior decoding performance.

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

*Junfeng Ni,Yixin Chen,Zhifei Yang,Yu Liu,Ruijie Lu,Song-Chun Zhu,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve 3D scene reconstruction by leveraging accurate geometry guidance from planar structures to enhance generative model performance in both observed and unobserved regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with poor reconstruction quality in observed regions and multi-view inconsistencies in generated images due to lack of reliable geometric supervision, leading to shape-appearance ambiguities.

Method: Leverages planar structures to derive accurate metric-scale depth maps, incorporates geometry guidance throughout the generative pipeline for visibility mask estimation, novel view selection, and multi-view consistency enhancement when inpainting with video diffusion models.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending datasets in both geometry and appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Supports single-view inputs and unposed videos with strong generalizability across indoor and outdoor scenarios.

Conclusion: Accurate geometry is fundamental for effectively exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction, and the proposed geometry-guided approach enables consistent and high-quality scene completion.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework with Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network and Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS) to address challenges in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key challenges in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning: large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning, and inconsistency between stage-wise optimization and global inference.

Method: Uses Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network built on pre-trained models, learning lightweight adapters with minimal parameter overhead. Implements Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS) that decouples positive and negative sample constraints by comparing them with virtual anchors to align feature spaces across stages.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show DRL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The DRL framework effectively addresses key CIL challenges through efficient adapter-based learning and discriminative representation alignment, achieving superior performance with maintained efficiency.

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSDiff is a self-supervised selective-guided diffusion method for old-photo face restoration that uses pseudo-reference faces and staged supervision to handle breakage, fading, and blur while maintaining identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-guided methods struggle with localized artifacts and face color in old-photo restoration due to reliance on explicit degradation priors or global statistical guidance.

Method: Leverages pseudo-reference faces from pre-trained diffusion model with weak guidance, uses staged supervision (structural guidance throughout denoising, color refinement in later steps), and incorporates face parsing maps and scratch masks for selective restoration.

Result: Outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability on the constructed VintageFace benchmark of 300 real old photos.

Conclusion: SSDiff effectively handles compounded degradations in old photos through selective guidance and staged supervision while avoiding identity mismatch issues.

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageSentinel is a framework that protects visual datasets from unauthorized use in Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation systems by generating sentinel images with embedded character sequences as retrieval keys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about unauthorized use of private image datasets in RAIG systems, as traditional watermarking fails due to complex feature extraction processes.

Method: Leverages vision-language models to synthesize sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with original datasets, embedding randomly generated character sequences as retrieval keys for protection verification.

Result: Experimental results show ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

Conclusion: ImageSentinel provides an effective solution for protecting visual datasets in RAIG systems, overcoming limitations of traditional watermarking approaches.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A constrained optimization method for designing practical coding functions in compressive single-photon 3D imaging that addresses hardware limitations like bandwidth and peak power constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-photon cameras face performance limitations due to hardware constraints (bandwidth, laser power, data rates), and existing compressive histograms underperform under real-world illumination constraints.

Method: Joint optimization of illumination and coding matrix using gradient descent, ensuring adherence to hardware constraints while designing coding functions.

Result: The optimized coding functions consistently outperform traditional designs under bandwidth and peak power constraints, with particular advantage in peak-power-limited systems, and adapt to arbitrary impulse responses.

Conclusion: The constrained optimization approach enables practical coding function design that overcomes hardware limitations in compressive single-photon 3D imaging systems.

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between open-source and commercial visual captioning models, enabling cost-effective applications like data synthesis.

Method: Proposes CapFlow, a multi-agent collaboration workflow that leverages open-source models to generate high-quality captions, then uses these as training data to fine-tune MetaCaptioner.

Result: CapFlow achieves caption quality comparable to GPT-4 with 89.5% cost reduction. MetaCaptioner achieves commercial-level captioning capabilities and top-tier multimodal performance in open-source community.

Conclusion: CapFlow and MetaCaptioner provide a strong, cost-effective visual captioning solution that can benefit future multimodal research.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote physiological measurement requires privacy-sensitive user data, and existing contactless methods rely on labeled client data, making it challenging to update deployed models with unlabeled user data.

Method: FedHUG framework with two modules: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation that dynamically adjusts weights based on bias evaluation for heterogeneous non-IID features, and (2) Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller that parameterizes label distribution and manipulates client training strategies to address server-client distribution skew and long-tail issues.

Result: Superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation with either RGB video or mmWave radar.

Conclusion: FedHUG effectively addresses privacy and label scarcity challenges in remote physiological measurement through federated unsupervised domain generalization.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFF method for Continual Test-Time Adaptation uses class-aware domain knowledge fusion and fission to dynamically accumulate discriminative historical knowledge while avoiding negative knowledge interference from old domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting of historical knowledge and insufficient learning of new knowledge due to irregular switching of downstream domain data, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes KFF with two modules: 1) Knowledge Fission (KFI) to separate new domain knowledge from class-aware domain prompt pool, and 2) Knowledge Fusion (KFU) to merge new knowledge with minimal cost using greedy dynamic merging strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against other methods.

Conclusion: KFF method successfully addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and insufficient learning in CTTA by adaptively managing domain knowledge through fusion and fission mechanisms.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Motivation: Traditional prototype methods fail to capture intra-class diversity due to deterministic averaging, leading to brittle representations that struggle with anatomical variability in medical images.

Method: Uses diffusion processes to transform single prototypes into diverse variant sets, with spatial-aware conditioning and conservative fusion to preserve fidelity while maximizing diversity.

Result: Significant improvements on abdominal MRI and CT datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based prototype learning effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods by generating diverse yet semantically coherent representations from minimal data.

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

### [85] [State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Kai Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSP is a State Space Prompting method for video understanding that uses intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to better capture spatiotemporal information in videos, outperforming SOTA methods by 2.76% on average with fewer fine-tuning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for pre-trained state space models fail to effectively capture spatial and temporal contextual information in videos, limiting the propagation of discriminative information within and between frames.

Method: Proposes State Space Prompting (SSP) with two modules: Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) to aggregate spatial key information within frames, and Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across frames.

Result: Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets show SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing fine-tuning parameter overhead.

Conclusion: SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos through adaptive balancing and compression of key spatio-temporal information, achieving superior performance with efficient parameter usage.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

*Yusen Xie,Zhenmin Huang,Jianhao Jiao,Dimitrios Kanoulas,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniGS is a unified differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting, featuring improved depth rendering, geometric consistency, and efficient pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction with geometric accuracy and computational efficiency across RGB, depth, normals, and semantics.

Method: Uses CUDA-accelerated rasterization with differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection for depth, analytic gradient formulation for surface normals, and learnable attribute for differentiable pruning of Gaussians.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities (RGB, depth, normals, semantics) with improved geometric consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware paradigm effectively integrates multiple modalities and demonstrates superior reconstruction performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.
Source code and multimodal viewer will be available on GitHub.

*Youngju Yoo,Seho Kim,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D is an end-to-end box-supervised 3D instance segmentation method that uses a student-teacher framework with pseudo-mask generation, eliminating the need for two-stage training while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised 3D instance segmentation requires expensive point-level annotations, while existing box-supervised methods use two-stage pipelines that increase training complexity and hinder end-to-end optimization.

Method: Uses student-teacher framework with exponential moving average updates; introduces instance center-based query refinement for better pseudo-mask generation; employs query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss for semantic and geometric alignment.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: BEEP3D provides an effective end-to-end solution for box-supervised 3D instance segmentation that overcomes the limitations of two-stage approaches while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompoDistill is a knowledge distillation framework that addresses visual attention misalignment between teacher and student MLLMs to improve visual perception abilities in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill teacher MLLMs' rich visual perception abilities to student models, with visual attention misalignment identified as the main cause.

Method: Proposed CompoDistill framework that explicitly aligns student's visual attention with teacher's visual attention to enhance visual perception capabilities.

Result: Significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks requiring visual perception while maintaining strong VQA performance; effective with advanced backbones.

Conclusion: CompoDistill effectively addresses visual attention misalignment in KD for MLLMs, demonstrating improved visual perception transfer and generalizability across different model architectures.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Method: Used NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator tool to generate synthetic data for pallet detection in warehouse settings. Conducted experiments comparing models trained on real data only vs. various synthetic dataset generation strategies.

Result: The study found that synthetic data can effectively improve object detection model performance in real-world warehouse scenarios when properly integrated with real data.

Conclusion: A balanced integration of synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection models, providing valuable insights for practical computer vision applications in logistics and manufacturing.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic

synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIANet is a dual-stream framework for micro-expression recognition that uses phase-aware dynamic images to capture onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases separately, achieving superior performance over single-phase methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to subtle facial cues and limited data. Conventional dynamic image methods overlook distinct temporal phase characteristics within micro-expressions.

Method: Proposes DIANet with dual streams: one for onset-to-apex phase and another for apex-to-offset phase, each processed by dedicated CNNs and integrated via cross-attention fusion module.

Result: Outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based approaches on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW), demonstrating the importance of explicit temporal phase modeling.

Conclusion: Modeling temporal phase information explicitly is crucial for advancing micro-expression recognition, and DIANet provides a promising direction for future MER research.

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HoneyBee, a large-scale chain-of-thought reasoning dataset for vision-language models, and analyzes data curation strategies that significantly improve VL reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The principles underlying effective vision-language reasoning training datasets are poorly understood, despite advances in VLMs. The authors aim to systematically study data curation approaches to improve VL reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors introduced several data curation approaches including analyzing context source strategies, implementing targeted interventions (auxiliary signals from captions, text-only reasoning), and scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought solutions. They created HoneyBee dataset with 2.5M examples from 350K image-question pairs.

Result: HoneyBee-trained VLMs outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes. A 3B parameter model achieved 7.8% and 24.8% improvements over SOTA and base models respectively on MathVerse. They also proposed a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost by 73% without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The work presents improved strategies for vision-language reasoning dataset curation, demonstrating that careful data construction significantly enhances VLM reasoning capabilities through systematic scaling and targeted interventions.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

TL;DR: A self-correcting image generation method that combines auto-regressive token modeling with parallel token prediction, using iterative refinement to fix structural inconsistencies while maintaining efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving inference efficiency in image/video generation while addressing structural inconsistencies from parallel token prediction, as current methods lack backtracking mechanisms for erroneous predictions.

Method: Proposes iterative token refinement with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in context to improve robustness and enable token fixing during sampling.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in generation quality on ImageNet-256, CIFAR-10 (images) and UCF-101, NuScenes (videos) while preserving parallel token prediction efficiency.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction with enhanced generation quality through self-correction, demonstrating effectiveness across both image and video modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: To solve the dual challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in infrared small target detection for drone-based multi-modality sensing applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis for domain alignment using multi-frequency wavelet filtering, 2) Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning that extracts real noise characteristics to build dynamic noise library with self-supervised learning.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and demonstrates excellent robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Validated on Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark and other real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD effectively addresses cross-domain challenges and noise perturbations in infrared small target detection, showing superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many

*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes for robust video representation that handles tracking errors, occlusions, and large motions better than pixel-level methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video representations rely on unstable pixel-level matching and tracking, which are vulnerable to tracking errors, occlusions, and large motions that can collapse object representations.

Method: Uses hierarchical proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes, with dynamic representation update mechanism leveraging spatio-temporal priors and decoupled shape-texture encoding.

Result: Achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks like video in-painting and temporally consistent video editing.

Conclusion: Proxy node representation provides robust video modeling that overcomes limitations of pixel-level tracking while enabling controllable appearance editing and efficient video processing.

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two novel multiplicative loss functions for semantic segmentation that combine Cross Entropy and Dice Loss multiplicatively, with confidence-adaptive scaling to handle data scarcity in medical and cellular images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images suffer from data scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust training objectives. Existing additive combinations of Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are sensitive to hyperparameters and perform suboptimally with limited data.

Method: Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively to dynamically modulate gradients based on prediction confidence. Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss adds confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.

Result: Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and existing loss functions.

Conclusion: The proposed losses offer a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

TL;DR: Proposes using local background features from ID images as fake OOD features to train neural networks for better OOD detection, reducing overconfidence on OOD data without needing external OOD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods face challenges with neural networks producing overconfident predictions on OOD data, and existing approaches using auxiliary OOD datasets or generated fake OOD images are limited by high data collection and training costs.

Method: Extracts background features from in-distribution (ID) images as simulated OOD features during training, leveraging local invariance of convolution. Networks are optimized to reduce L2-norm of these background features to alleviate overconfidence on OOD data.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm effectiveness and wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective OOD detection approach that uses readily available background features from ID images as simulated OOD representations, successfully addressing overconfidence issues without requiring external OOD datasets.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Motivation: Existing unsupervised fusion methods rely on manually designed loss functions that have limitations: constructed reference images lack details and have uneven brightness, and gradient losses only focus on gradient magnitude without considering direction.

Method: Proposes AngularFuse framework with three key components: 1) Cross-modal complementary mask module to learn complementary information between modalities, 2) Fine-grained reference image synthesis using Laplacian edge enhancement and adaptive histogram equalization, 3) Angle-aware loss that constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD datasets show AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods by clear margin. Visual comparisons confirm sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes.

Conclusion: AngularFuse demonstrates superior fusion capability by preserving both texture intensity and correct edge orientation, producing enhanced images better suited for downstream applications like autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

*Chenghanyu Zhang,Zekun Li,Peipei Li,Xing Cui,Shuhan Xia,Weixiang Yan,Yiqiao Zhang,Qianyu Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpineBench is a comprehensive VQA benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in spinal medicine, featuring 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images covering 11 diseases, with challenging hard negative options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately assess MLLM performance in nuanced medical domains like spine, which heavily relies on visual input, creating a gap in specialized medical evaluation.

Method: Built by integrating and standardizing open-source spinal disease datasets, creating QA pairs for disease diagnosis and lesion localization with hard negative options based on visual similarity.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading MLLMs revealed poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting current limitations in the spine domain.

Conclusion: SpineBench identifies limitations of current MLLMs in spinal medicine and provides guidance for future improvements in this specialized medical application.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

*Ying A,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAGS introduces a semantic-aware 3D reconstruction framework that prioritizes safety-critical objects over static backgrounds, achieving high-quality reconstruction with 350+ FPS rendering speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction methods face a trade-off between fidelity and computational cost due to semantically agnostic designs that treat all scene elements equally.

Method: Uses two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization with hybrid importance metric to simplify non-critical elements while preserving safety-critical details, and (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline with priority-based depth pre-pass to cull occluded primitives.

Result: Achieves exceptional reconstruction quality on safety-critical objects while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS on Waymo and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: PAGS successfully addresses the fidelity-efficiency trade-off in dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction by incorporating task-aware semantic priorities into the reconstruction pipeline.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

### [101] [Dual Learning with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Soft Alignment for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12283)
*Jianfeng Dong,Lei Huang,Daizong Liu,Xianke Chen,Xun Yang,Changting Lin,Xun Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) that uses dynamic knowledge distillation from a large teacher model to train a dual-branch student network, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous text-to-video retrieval methods assume pre-trimmed videos with short durations, but real-world videos are untrimmed with complex background content, making partial relevance retrieval more practical and challenging.

Method: Proposes DL-DKD++: a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation. Uses a large teacher model to supervise a compact dual-branch student network (inheritance branch for transferable knowledge, exploration branch for task-specific learning), with dynamic soft-target construction replacing hard-target supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR task.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the practical challenge of retrieving partially relevant untrimmed videos by leveraging knowledge distillation and dual-branch learning with dynamic supervision.

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

### [102] [Vision Language Models Map Logos to Text via Semantic Entanglement in the Visual Projector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12287)
*Sifan Li,Hongkai Chen,Yujun Cai,Qingwen Ye,Liyang Chen,Junsong Yuan,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs hallucinate brand names from logos without visible text, with circular logos being particularly problematic. Projector dimensions are key to this failure, and targeted ablation can reduce errors while maintaining OCR accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models suffer from hallucinations where they generate text not grounded in visual evidence, particularly for logos that contain no visible words. This paper investigates logo hallucination as a specific failure mode.

Method: Used curated logo datasets (pure symbols, hybrids, text-bearing logos, and Hard-60 subset) with nine structured perturbations. Conducted embedding-level analysis with LLaVA to identify projector dimensions responsible for hallucinations, and performed targeted ablation experiments.

Result: VLMs consistently hallucinate brand names from non-text logos, especially circular ones. Hallucinations persist under strong distortions, with occlusion being the most revealing perturbation. A small subset of projector dimensions drives hallucination, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR performance.

Conclusion: VLMs rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception for logos. Projector subspaces play a decisive role in hallucination failures. Projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding are promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage hybrid approach combining 3D Gaussian splatting reconstruction with diffusion model enhancement for novel view synthesis in street scenes, achieving second place in the RealADSim-NVS challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of novel view synthesis in street scenes from different traversals (e.g., different lanes or directions), requiring generation of realistic urban environment renders from car-centric training frames.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fit 3D scene reconstruction using Gaussian splatting and render novel views from target cameras, 2) Enhance frames with a dedicated single-step diffusion model. Includes specific initialization techniques for Gaussian primitives and curated training data for the enhancer model.

Result: Achieved aggregated score of 0.432 on the public test leaderboard, placing second overall. Performance measured by PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics showing high novel view quality.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining 3D reconstruction with diffusion-based enhancement effectively addresses novel view synthesis in complex street scenes, demonstrating competitive performance in the challenge.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurriFlow is a semantic scene completion framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion to improve 3D geometry and semantic understanding from monocular images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision, limiting their effectiveness for camera-based perception in autonomous driving.

Method: Uses multi-level fusion with optical flow for temporal alignment, curriculum learning from LiDAR to stereo depth, and semantic priors from SAM for category-agnostic supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI with mean IoU of 16.9, demonstrating improved temporal consistency and geometric robustness.

Conclusion: The motion-guided and curriculum-aware design effectively addresses challenges in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

*Sharath M Shankaranarayana,Soumava Kumar Roy,Prasad Sudhakar,Chandan Aladahalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel learnable subsampling framework with attention-guided sampling that dynamically adapts to different inputs during inference, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance in 3D medical imaging and video classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often achieve performance gains at the cost of increased computational complexity and expense. Many tasks like 3D volume or video classification contain inherent redundancies where not all slices/frames are necessary, but existing subsampling methods are static and not input-adaptive.

Method: Developed an attention-guided sampling module that can be integrated into any neural network architecture. This framework overcomes the non-differentiability of subsampling operations and provides dynamic, input-adaptive sampling that adjusts to different inputs even during inference.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D and two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, including a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions. The method achieved performance gains while reducing complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-guided sampling framework successfully addresses the limitations of static subsampling methods by providing dynamic, input-adaptive sampling that reduces computational complexity while maintaining or improving performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STORM-PSR is a dual-stream framework for procedure step recognition that combines spatial and temporal features to handle partial occlusion, reducing prediction delays by 11.2-26.1% compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PSR models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual frames, neglecting temporal features. This limits robustness and accuracy, especially when objects are partially occluded.

Method: Proposed STORM-PSR uses a dual-stream framework: an assembly state detection stream for unobstructed views, and a spatio-temporal stream with spatial encoder (pre-trained using weak supervision) and transformer-based temporal encoder to handle occlusions.

Result: Evaluation on MECCANO and IndustReal datasets shows 11.2% and 26.1% reduction in average delay between actual and predicted step completions respectively. The spatio-temporal stream enables step recognition without requiring unobstructed object views.

Conclusion: STORM-PSR effectively addresses occlusion challenges in PSR by leveraging both spatial and temporal features, demonstrating significant improvements over frame-based approaches through its dual-stream architecture.

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a probabilistic approach to training scene coordinate regression models that incorporates reconstruction priors to prevent degeneration when training images have insufficient multi-view constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene coordinate regression models can degenerate when trained on images with insufficient multi-view constraints, leading to poor performance in 3D vision tasks like relocalization and structure-from-motion.

Method: Proposes probabilistic reinterpretation of SCR training that infuses high-level reconstruction priors, including simple depth distribution priors and learned priors using a 3D point cloud diffusion model trained on indoor scans.

Result: The priors help learn better scene representations, producing more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates, better camera poses, and improved performance on downstream tasks like novel view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating reconstruction priors during SCR training effectively prevents model degeneration and enhances performance across multiple 3D vision tasks on indoor datasets.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban monitoring methods using IoT sensors and manual inspections are costly, difficult to scale, and misaligned with citizens' visual perception. The paper explores whether machines can 'see' like citizens to assess urban infrastructure conditions.

Method: Following PRISMA methodology, the authors systematically reviewed 32 peer-reviewed studies to address four research questions about VLM applications in urban monitoring, focusing on tasks, architectures, datasets, and evaluation methods.

Result: The review identified effective urban monitoring tasks addressed by VLMs, commonly used VLM architectures with superior performance, supporting datasets and resources, and reported performance levels across different applications.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise as a technology for urban monitoring by integrating visual understanding with natural language reasoning, potentially enabling machines to assess urban infrastructure conditions in ways that align with citizens' visual perception.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel conditional flow matching framework for image quality transfer that reconstructs high-field-like MRI from low-field inputs using direct velocity field regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-field MRI offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality, creating a need to bridge this quality gap without expensive infrastructure.

Method: Uses conditional flow matching (CFM) to learn a continuous flow between noise distribution and target data through direct regression of an optimal velocity field, avoiding iterative sampling or adversarial objectives.

Result: CFM achieves state-of-the-art performance, generalizes robustly to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, and uses significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: CFM shows strong potential as a powerful and scalable tool for MRI reconstruction, particularly beneficial for resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy is a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding that addresses limitations in temporal context capture and information loss from sparse frame sampling through hierarchical memory structure and iterative backtracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based systems using LLMs for video understanding struggle with capturing temporal context between consecutive frames and risk losing crucial information due to sparse frame sampling to reduce costs.

Method: VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity, inspired by human recollection from coarse to fine. It uses an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism to systematically mine video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered.

Result: VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance that surpasses even proprietary models like GPT-4o. The framework is built on open-source models.

Conclusion: VideoLucy effectively addresses temporal understanding challenges in long videos while preserving critical details through its deep memory backtracking approach and hierarchical memory structure.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG), focusing on Chest X-ray imaging. It addresses the gap in existing surveys by systematically examining dataset construction, model architectures, evaluation protocols, and performance analysis for longitudinal settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional single-image Chest X-ray radiology report generation approaches, which fail to capture longitudinal context needed for clinically faithful comparison statements. Existing surveys primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving researchers without systematic guidance for longitudinal model design.

Method: The survey comprehensively reviews longitudinal radiology report generation by examining: dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures with longitudinally tailored designs, evaluation protocols including longitudinal-specific measures and standard benchmarks, performance analysis of LRRG methods, and ablation studies.

Result: The analysis highlights the critical role of longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model performance. The survey identifies that incorporating longitudinal data enables models to leverage historical studies in ways that mirror radiologists' diagnostic workflows.

Conclusion: The survey summarizes five major limitations of current research and outlines promising directions for future development, aiming to establish a foundation for advancing the emerging field of longitudinal radiology report generation.

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

### [112] [MS-GAGA: Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12468)
*Dion J. X. Ho,Gabriel Lee Jun Rong,Niharika Shrivastava,Harshavardhan Abichandani,Pai Chet Ng,Xiaoxiao Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GAGA is a two-stage framework for creating transferable and imperceptible adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings, achieving up to 27% higher attack success rates than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors that work across different models (transferable) while remaining visually undetectable, especially in practical black-box scenarios where the target model's architecture is unknown.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses dual-stream attack (MNTD-PGD for small perturbations and SG-PGD for salient regions) to generate candidates; Stage 2 employs metric-aware selection to optimize both transferability and imperceptibility using SSIM.

Result: Achieves up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen deepfake detectors compared to state-of-the-art attacks, demonstrating superior transferability while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: MS-GAGA effectively balances transferability and imperceptibility in black-box adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors through its dual-stream generation and metric-aware selection approach.

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

TL;DR: Proposes an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation to preserve spatial consistency in text-guided medical image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common data augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between images and text in multimodal learning for medical image segmentation, weakening performance.

Method: Early fusion framework combining text and visual features before augmentation, with a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space to bridge semantic gaps.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, with visualization showing accurate region localization.

Conclusion: The proposed early fusion approach effectively preserves spatial consistency in text-guided medical image segmentation and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly
available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.

*An Zhao,Piaopiao Yu,Zhe Zhu,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting (BSGS) is a novel framework that reconstructs high-quality 3D scenes from motion-blurred images through a two-stage optimization process with camera pose refinement and global rigid transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods have limitations including extreme dependence on accurate camera poses and inability to control erroneous Gaussian primitive densification caused by motion blur.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Camera Pose Refinement to reduce motion-induced distortions, 2) Global Rigid Transformation to correct blur distortions. Uses subframe gradient aggregation and space-time bi-stage optimization to prevent noisy Gaussian generation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments verify the method's effectiveness and show superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: BSGS successfully addresses the challenges of 3D scene reconstruction from motion-blurred images through its bi-stage optimization strategy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAD is a lightweight, network-free method that computes Unsigned Distance Fields from unoriented point clouds using Voronoi-based geometric criteria and diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for learning UDFs suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability.

Method: Assigns bi-directional normals using Voronoi-based geometric criteria, then diffuses aligned normals to form an approximate UDF gradient field, which is integrated to recover the final UDF.

Result: VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces, complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining computationally efficient and stable.

Conclusion: The proposed Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion method provides a stable and efficient alternative to neural approaches for computing UDFs from unoriented point clouds.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model achieves state-of-the-art human motion generation using only careful normalization and analytical loss weightings, avoiding complex features and auxiliary losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on over-parameterized features and auxiliary losses, which should not be necessary for diffusion models to match human motion distribution.

Method: Score-based diffusion model with feature-space normalization and analytically derived weightings for L2 score-matching loss, generating both motion and shape directly.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation without slow post hoc shape recovery.

Conclusion: Simple diffusion models with proper normalization and loss weighting can match complex methods, providing a theoretically motivated and effective approach.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning suffer from poor generalization, while RL faces sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. Combining both approaches can overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposes CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework where IL and RL agents interact during training through a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD effectively combines IL and RL through competitive interaction, outperforming conventional two-stage approaches and demonstrating superior performance in autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMOT is the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking, featuring large-scale data, comprehensive challenges, and precise oriented annotations. The paper also presents a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme that significantly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms degrade in aerial views due to reliance on spatial appearance cues. Multispectral imagery provides crucial spectral reflectance cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions, but the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress.

Method: Introduces MMOT benchmark with 125 video sequences and 488.8K annotations across eight categories. Presents a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme featuring: (1) lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem for spectral feature integration, (2) orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation, and (3) end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. The proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches across representative trackers.

Conclusion: The work advances drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research by providing the first comprehensive benchmark and demonstrating the significant benefits of multispectral imagery for aerial tracking tasks, especially in challenging conditions with small targets and dense scenarios.

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our

TL;DR: Temporally Conditional Mamba (TCM) is a new mamba-based model that improves human motion generation by integrating conditional information into recurrent dynamics, achieving better temporal alignment than cross-attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using cross-attention struggle to maintain step-by-step temporal alignment between conditioning inputs and generated human motion, limiting their effectiveness in capturing temporal patterns.

Method: The approach integrates conditional information directly into the recurrent dynamics of Mamba blocks, enabling better temporal alignment compared to cross-attention mechanisms that primarily capture global interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art approaches across various human motion tasks.

Conclusion: The Temporally Conditional Mamba model effectively addresses temporal alignment limitations in human motion generation by leveraging recurrent dynamics for conditional integration, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the annotation bottleneck in agricultural image segmentation and overcome limitations of supervised methods that struggle with limited training data and complex field conditions.

Method: Leverages Plantnet's specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and generate coarse masks, then refines them using Segment Anything Model (SAM) for detailed segmentations.

Result: Consistent performance gains when using Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over base DinoV2 model across four datasets of varying complexity, as measured by Jaccard Index (IoU).

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with specialized plant-centric models can effectively alleviate annotation requirements and enable robust segmentation in diverse agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync is a domain-agnostic approach that improves diffusion model training efficiency and generation quality by using the model's own intermediate representations as intrinsic guidance, eliminating the need for external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research showed that external guidance on diffusion model intermediate representations accelerates training, but this requires additional resources. The authors aim to create a self-sufficient method that leverages the model's own representations without external dependencies.

Method: LayerSync regularizes diffusion models by using their own intermediate representations, where semantically rich representations guide weaker ones. It's implemented as a plug-and-play regularizer term with no training overhead and works across visual, audio, video, and motion domains.

Result: LayerSync significantly improves training efficiency and generation quality. It speeds up flow-based transformer training by 8.75x on ImageNet and improves generation quality by 23.6%. The method works across multiple domains without requiring pretrained models or additional data.

Conclusion: LayerSync provides an effective, self-sufficient approach for improving diffusion models across various domains by leveraging intrinsic representation guidance, eliminating the need for external supervision while maintaining training efficiency.

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

TL;DR: A two-stage training framework that closes the performance gap between pixel-space and latent-space generative models for diffusion and consistency models, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-space generative models are more difficult to train and generally underperform compared to latent-space models, creating a persistent performance and efficiency gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Pre-train encoders to capture semantics from clean images and align them with sampling trajectory points; 2) Integrate encoder with randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models.

Result: Diffusion model achieves FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 NFE, surpassing prior pixel-space methods. Consistency model achieves FID of 8.82 on ImageNet-256 in single step, significantly outperforming latent-space counterpart.

Conclusion: The framework successfully closes the performance gap for pixel-space models, enabling high-quality generation without relying on pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models, marking the first successful training of consistency models directly on high-resolution images.

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

TL;DR: IVT-LR introduces multimodal latent reasoning that combines visual and textual information in latent space, eliminating the need for explicit reasoning steps and achieving 5.45% accuracy improvement with 5x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning methods require labor-intensive vision-text annotations for explicit reasoning steps and suffer from significant inference latency.

Method: Proposes Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR) that represents reasoning steps using latent text (previous hidden states) and latent vision (selected image embeddings), with progressive multi-stage training.

Result: Achieves 5.45% average accuracy improvement on M3CoT and ScienceQA datasets while achieving over 5x speed increase compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: IVT-LR provides an efficient and effective multimodal reasoning approach that reduces annotation requirements and inference latency while improving performance.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing USOD methods ignore underwater imaging physics or treat degradation as noise, failing to utilize valuable information in underwater images.

Method: Proposes WaterFlow framework using rectified flow with explicit underwater physical imaging priors and temporal dimension modeling in network training.

Result: Achieves 0.072 gain in S_m metric on USOD10K dataset, demonstrating effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: WaterFlow effectively incorporates underwater physical information and temporal modeling to enhance salient object detection in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

TL;DR: ZSCFC is an efficient zero-shot denoiser that uses cross-frequency consistency to denoise single images without noise distribution assumptions, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot denoisers have long training times and rely on unrealistic noise assumptions (independence and zero-mean), limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex noise characteristics.

Method: Proposes ZSCFC method that leverages cross-frequency consistency - image textures show position similarity and content consistency across frequency bands while noise doesn't. Uses cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network for single-image training and denoising.

Result: Experiments on various real-world image datasets show ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in both computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC provides an efficient and effective solution for real-world denoising that works with single noisy images and doesn't require noise distribution assumptions.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of

### [126] [On the Use of Hierarchical Vision Foundation Models for Low-Cost Human Mesh Recovery and Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12660)
*Shuhei Tarashima,Yushan Wang,Norio Tagawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops efficient human mesh recovery (HMR) and human pose estimation (HPE) models by using only early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models as encoders, achieving comparable performance to full models with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art HMR methods use large non-hierarchical vision transformers, which are computationally expensive. The authors aim to create simpler and more efficient models by leveraging hierarchical vision foundation models.

Method: Proposed using only the first two or three stages of hierarchical VFMs (Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, VMamba) as encoders for HMR/HPE, based on observation that intermediate stages produce feature maps with comparable resolutions to non-hierarchical counterparts.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based models showed that truncated models achieve performance on par with full-stage models while exhibiting better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing lightweight alternatives.

Conclusion: Using early stages of hierarchical VFMs provides an effective approach for developing efficient HMR and HPE models that maintain performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

*Julen Costa-Watanabe,Isabelle Wittmann,Benedikt Blumenstiel,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraCodec (TEC) is a family of learned compression codecs specifically designed for Earth observation data, achieving 3-10x better compression than classical methods while enabling zero-shot cloud inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation satellites generate massive multispectral image time series that pose storage and transmission challenges. Current learned compression methods are fragmented and misaligned with natural image compression advances, with image codecs ignoring temporal redundancy and video codecs failing to capture radiometric evolution of static scenes.

Method: TEC includes image-based variants for multispectral inputs and a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages temporal dependencies. It introduces Latent Repacking for training flexible-rate transformer models that operate across varying rate-distortion settings.

Result: Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs with 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark.

Conclusion: Bespoke learned compression algorithms are a promising direction for Earth observation, with TEC establishing new standards for compression efficiency and additional capabilities like cloud inpainting.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

*Zefu Lin,Wenbo Chen,Xiaojuan Jin,Yuran Yang,Lue Fan,Yixin Zhang,Yufeng Zhang,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework that preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BEV-based approaches for UAV swarm systems have limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic/geometric information, and performance degrades with undefined/occluded objects.

Method: Integrates Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature Integration, with Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction and Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance for efficient feature selection and communication reduction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current BEV-based methods and provides an efficient solution for multi-UAV collaborative perception.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

*Kunyu Peng,Di Wen,Kailun Yang,Jia Fu,Yufan Chen,Ruiping Liu,Jiamin Wu,Junwei Zheng,M. Saquib Sarfraz,Luc Van Gool,Danda Pani Paudel,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EReLiFM is a meta-learning approach for Open-Set Domain Generalization with Noisy Labels, using evidential loss clustering and residual flow matching to handle label noise and domain gaps effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise corrupts source-domain knowledge in OSDG, making it difficult to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. Existing methods struggle with domain gaps when clean labeled data is limited.

Method: Uses unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering for label reliability awareness, and residual flow matching to model domain- and category-conditioned residuals for uncertainty-aware transfer paths. Meta-learning optimizes update direction on clean set to maximize loss decrease on noisy set.

Result: EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed EReLiFM effectively addresses the challenges of OSDG with noisy labels through evidential reliability awareness and residual flow meta-learning.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

*Shelley Zixin Shu,Haozhe Luo,Alexander Poellinger,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes H-EGL framework combining self-supervised and human-guided constraints to improve attention alignment and generalization in medical imaging transformers, outperforming existing EGL methods on chest X-ray classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models in medical imaging suffer from spurious correlations and biases, while human-AI attention alignment requires costly manual supervision.

Method: Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework with self-supervised component using class-distinctive attention without restrictive priors, combined with human-guided constraints.

Result: H-EGL outperforms two state-of-the-art EGL methods on chest X-ray classification using Vision Transformer, achieving superior classification accuracy, generalization, and attention maps better aligned with human expertise.

Conclusion: H-EGL effectively enhances attention alignment and generalization in medical imaging transformers without relying on costly manual supervision.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

*Xingang Guo,Utkarsh Tyagi,Advait Gosai,Paula Vergara,Ernesto Gabriel Hernández Montoya,Chen Bo Calvin Zhang,Bin Hu,Yunzhong He,Bing Liu,Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRIS is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to actively manipulate and reason with images (think with images), showing current models struggle with integrating vision and tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks treat images as static inputs (think about images), but real-world applications require MLLMs to actively manipulate images through cropping, editing, or enhancement to solve complex tasks.

Method: Introduces IRIS benchmark with 1,204 challenging vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) across five domains, with detailed rubrics for systematic evaluation under the think with images paradigm.

Result: Current MLLMs perform poorly, with GPT-5-think achieving only 18.68% pass rate. Models show divergent tool-use behaviors - OpenAI models benefit from image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement.

Conclusion: IRIS provides the first benchmark for think with images paradigm, offering critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs and highlighting the gap between current capabilities and real-world requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A personalized federated fine-tuning method using orthogonal LoRA adapters to separate general and client-specific knowledge for medical AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in healthcare require fine-tuning for specific tasks, but data sharing is restricted due to privacy concerns, making federated learning a promising solution.

Method: Proposes learning orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general and client-specific knowledge, allowing clients to leverage both their own data and data from others.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks show the approach is competitive against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The method enables effective personalized federated fine-tuning of foundation models for healthcare while addressing data privacy constraints.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVSR is a diffusion-based one-step streaming framework for real-time video super-resolution that achieves 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on A100 GPU through three innovations: three-stage distillation, sparse attention, and tiny conditional decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make diffusion-based video super-resolution practical by overcoming challenges of high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions.

Method: Three complementary innovations: (1) train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline for streaming super-resolution, (2) locality-constrained sparse attention to reduce redundant computation and bridge train-test resolution gap, (3) tiny conditional decoder for accelerated reconstruction without quality loss. Also created VSR-120K dataset with 120k videos and 180k images.

Result: Achieves approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on single A100 GPU, scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions, achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models.

Conclusion: FlashVSR makes diffusion-based video super-resolution practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance, with code, models, and dataset to be released for future research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

*Zhiliu Yang,Jinyu Dai,Jianyuan Zhang,Zhu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS is a unified framework that integrates Video Panoptic Segmentation, Visual Odometry, and Scene Rendering to address scene understanding challenges like segmentation deficiency, dynamic object interference, and view limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene perception solutions suffer from segmentation deficiencies, dynamic object interference, sensor data sparsity, and view limitations, which hinder embodied-AI agents' performance.

Method: Uses adaptive attention-based geometric fusion for VPS to align cross-frame features with pose, depth, and optical flow. Combines panoptic segmentation with optical flow for improved VO confidence estimation. Employs point-based rendering to transform sparse point clouds into neural fields for high-fidelity view synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets show superior performance on odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The SPORTS framework successfully integrates VPS, VO, and SR through iterative and unified perspective, demonstrating improved scene understanding capabilities for embodied-AI agents.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQArt-Bench is a new VQA benchmark for cultural heritage that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by focusing on deep semantic understanding of visual art through multi-agent generated questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding in complex domains like visual art analysis, as they use simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes that encourage models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning.

Method: Developed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions, structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed significant limitations, including surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench successfully exposes limitations in current MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex domains requiring deep semantic understanding of visual art and cultural heritage.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

### [136] [E-MoFlow: Learning Egomotion and Optical Flow from Event Data via Implicit Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12753)
*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MoFlow is an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes ego-motion and optical flow estimation for event cameras using implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without ground truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches estimate optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion separately, which is ill-posed for event cameras due to lack of robust data association. Existing methods either introduce bias through explicit regularization or converge to suboptimal solutions with explicit parametrization.

Method: Models camera ego-motion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation, incorporating spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases. Uses differential geometric constraints to embed structure-and-motion priors without explicit depth estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive results even with supervised approaches. Demonstrates versatility for general 6-DoF motion scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies ego-motion and optical flow estimation through implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm, addressing the ill-posed nature of the problem for event cameras.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning approach for PET head motion correction using cross-attention to predict rigid head motion from 3D PET raw data, outperforming existing methods and achieving results comparable to gold-standard hardware motion tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head movement in PET imaging causes artifacts and quantification inaccuracies, while hardware-based motion tracking has limited clinical applicability.

Method: DL-HMC++ uses deep learning with cross-attention to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data, trained supervisedly using dynamic PET scans with gold-standard motion measurements.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven methods, produces motion-free images with clear brain structure delineation, achieves average difference ratios of 1.2±0.5% (HRRT) and 0.5±0.2% (mCT) compared to gold-standard HMT.

Conclusion: DL-HMC++ enables data-driven PET head motion correction that can replace hardware-based tracking, making motion correction accessible for clinical populations beyond research settings.

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

TL;DR: AnyUp is a feature-agnostic upsampling method that works with any vision feature at any resolution without encoder-specific training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based upsamplers need retraining for each feature extractor and don't generalize across different feature types at inference time.

Method: Proposes an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture that doesn't require encoder-specific training.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, preserves feature semantics, and is efficient for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AnyUp provides a versatile and high-quality upsampling solution that works across various vision features without retraining requirements.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution has advanced significantly, approaches focusing on perceptual quality metrics remain relatively inefficient, creating a gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Developed solutions with strict efficiency constraints (≤5M parameters, ≤2000 GFLOPs) and evaluated on a novel 500-image 4K dataset with multiple degradation types, simulating realistic deployment conditions.

Result: The top-performing approach outperformed Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets while meeting the efficiency constraints, demonstrating superior perceptual quality.

Conclusion: This work establishes modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution, showing that efficient methods can achieve high perceptual quality in realistic deployment scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

### [140] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D introduces uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting that uses per-Gaussian uncertainty estimation to improve 4D scene reconstruction by propagating reliable motion cues and handling occlusion better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained with occlusion and extreme view ambiguities. Vanilla dynamic Gaussian Splatting optimizes all primitives uniformly, ignoring observation reliability, leading to motion drifts and degraded synthesis.

Method: Estimates time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization, treating well-observed Gaussians as reliable anchors and poorly observed ones as less reliable.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets show consistent improvements over vanilla dynamic Gaussian Splatting, with more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling uncertainty in dynamic Gaussian Splatting significantly enhances 4D reconstruction quality by propagating reliable motion cues and handling observation reliability.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

### [141] [What If : Understanding Motion Through Sparse Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12777)
*Stefan Andreas Baumann,Nick Stracke,Timy Phan,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) is a novel framework that predicts multi-modal scene motion distributions from sparse interactions called "pokes", providing interpretable motion representations and handling scene dynamics uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods only enable dense sampling of single motion realizations, lacking interpretable representations of multi-modal scene dynamics and their dependencies on physical interactions.

Method: FPT uses a transformer-based framework to directly predict distributions of local motion conditioned on sparse pokes, providing explicit motion distributions rather than single realizations.

Result: FPT outperforms specialized baselines on dense face motion generation, achieves significant improvements on out-of-distribution articulated object motion estimation, and shows competitive performance on moving part segmentation from pokes.

Conclusion: FPT provides a versatile, interpretable framework for multi-modal scene motion prediction that handles uncertainties and dependencies on physical interactions, demonstrating strong performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

### [142] [SRUM: Fine-Grained Self-Rewarding for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12784)
*Weiyang Jin,Yuwei Niu,Jiaqi Liao,Chengqi Duan,Aoxue Li,Shenghua Gao,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRUM is a self-rewarding post-training framework that enables Unified Multimodal Models to use their own understanding module as an evaluator to improve their generation module through a global-local dual reward system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap where UMMs' strong visual understanding capabilities don't transfer to visual generation. The paper aims to bridge this gap by enabling models to achieve self-improvement using their understanding module to reward their generation module.

Method: SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's understanding module acts as an internal evaluator, providing corrective signals to improve generation. It uses a global-local dual reward system with global reward for overall visual semantics/layout and local reward for fine-grained object-level fidelity.

Result: SRUM significantly boosts performance on benchmarks: T2I-CompBench improved from 82.18 to 88.37, and T2I-ReasonBench improved from 43.82 to 46.75.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new paradigm for enabling UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation via self-rewarding, demonstrating strong generalization without requiring additional human-labeled data.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

### [143] [MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12785)
*Felix Taubner,Ruihang Zhang,Mathieu Tuli,Sherwin Bahmani,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D is a video diffusion model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital humans from a single reference image and target expressions, enabling 360-degree viewpoint rendering and real-time 4D avatar creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional photorealistic human avatar creation is expensive and time-consuming, requiring complex camera rigs and manual effort. While recent single-image methods lower barriers, they lack multi-view constraints and degrade quality when viewpoints deviate from the reference.

Method: Based on a pre-trained video diffusion model, MVP4D generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying up to 360 degrees around a subject. The outputs are distilled into a real-time renderable 4D avatar.

Result: The approach significantly improves realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: MVP4D enables high-quality, animatable digital human avatars from single casually captured images, advancing the accessibility and quality of avatar creation for immersive applications.

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

### [145] [UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789)
*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion is a diffusion-based generative model that uses a frozen vision-language model as a unified multimodal encoder, featuring Layerwise Attention Pooling for better text-image alignment and VERIFI for flexible inference with prompt rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures use separate encoders for images and text, limiting cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Previous unified approaches require substantial computational resources and large-scale data, making them inaccessible.

Method: Uses a frozen VLM as unified encoder with Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) to extract both high-level semantics and low-level details. Proposes VERIFI for conditioning diffusion transformers on VLM-generated text tokens during in-model prompt rewriting.

Result: LAP outperforms other fusion architectures on text-image alignment. Finetuning on editing improves generation alignment and shows cross-modality knowledge transfer. Model zero-shot generalizes from single to multiple image references.

Conclusion: UniFusion demonstrates that using a frozen VLM as unified encoder enables effective cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer, with strong generalization capabilities and improved text-image alignment for generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

### [146] [ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12793)
*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO reduces MLLM inference costs by dynamically adjusting vision tokens based on semantic complexity, achieving 50% token reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs suffer from high inference costs due to excessive vision tokens from image inputs, requiring more efficient token management.

Method: Uses multiple MLP connectors with different compression ratios to downsample vision tokens based on semantic complexity, with KL divergence minimization during training and a Visual Resolution Router for automatic compression rate selection at inference.

Result: Reduces vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities of the model.

Conclusion: ViCO enables more efficient MLLMs by dynamically adapting visual token count to semantic complexity rather than image resolution, contributing to cost-effective multimodal AI.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay is a differentiable vectorization layer that integrates Cubical Multiparameter Persistence into deep learning, enabling robust topological feature extraction for image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) is powerful for topological image analysis but hindered by complexity of multifiltration structures and vectorization challenges.

Method: Decomposes CMP into learnable single-parameter persistence components with jointly learned bifiltration functions, creating differentiable topological feature vectors compatible with modern architectures like Swin Transformers.

Result: Theoretical stability guarantees under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Experiments show improved classification and segmentation performance on medical imaging and computer vision datasets, especially in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: CuMPerLay provides a promising approach for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis through differentiable topological feature extraction.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0 introduces world modeling to address supervision deficit in Vision-Language-Action models by predicting future images, enabling dense self-supervised learning of driving environment dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models suffer from supervision deficit where large model capacity is underutilized due to sparse, low-dimensional action supervision, limiting their potential for generalized driving intelligence.

Method: Proposes DriveVLA-W0 training paradigm with world modeling to predict future images, implemented as autoregressive world model for discrete visual tokens and diffusion world model for continuous visual features, plus lightweight action expert for real-time inference.

Result: Significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines on NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and 680x larger in-house dataset, demonstrating amplified data scaling law where performance gains accelerate with larger training datasets.

Conclusion: World modeling effectively addresses supervision deficit in VLA models, enabling better utilization of model capacity and accelerating performance improvements through data scaling.

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni is a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object detection performance comparable to regression-based models through quantized coordinate tokens, multi-source data engines, and two-stage training with RL post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detection models dominate but recent MLLM attempts face issues like low recall, duplicate predictions, and coordinate misalignment. The paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a language-aware visual perception system.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Quantized coordinate tokens (0-999) for easier learning, 2) Multiple data engines for grounding/referring/pointing data, 3) Two-stage training with SFT on 22M data followed by GRPO-based RL post-training with geometry-aware rewards.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (DINO, Grounding DINO) in zero-shot settings on COCO and LVIS benchmarks. Enables versatile capabilities including object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing.

Conclusion: Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems, successfully bridging the gap between traditional detection models and MLLM approaches.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1 is a multimodal LLM that performs on-demand web searches with dynamic query crafting for both image and text search, using a two-stage training pipeline and a novel multimodal VQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed queries, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes for real-world information-seeking queries.

Method: Two-stage training: cold start supervised finetuning followed by online reinforcement learning optimization. Uses DeepMMSearchVQA dataset with multimodal queries that teach when/what to search, which tool to use, and how to reason over retrieved information.

Result: Extensive experiments across knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The approach provides valuable insights for advancing multimodal web-search capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio language models treat audio understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks, lacking unified multimodal reasoning capabilities essential for advanced AI systems.

Method: Developed UALM-Gen for text-to-audio generation using direct audio token prediction, then unified all tasks through proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques. Also created UALM-Reason for multimodal reasoning using both text and audio in intermediate thinking steps.

Result: Single UALM model matches state-of-the-art specialized models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning. UALM-Reason demonstrates effective cross-modal generative reasoning confirmed by subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: UALM successfully unifies audio understanding, generation, and multimodal reasoning in one model, representing the first demonstration of cross-modal generative reasoning in audio research.

Abstract: Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio
understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies
attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal
reasoning. This paper introduces U}nified Audio Language Model (UALM), which
aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal
reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a
text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is
comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate,
using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that
our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized
models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning.
Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes
both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex
generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio
research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed
by subjective evaluations.

*Cristina Aggazzotti,Ashi Garg,Zexin Cai,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Voice anonymization works for short utterances but fails in long-form audio where multiple utterances reveal speaker identity through vocabulary and style. The paper proposes content anonymization via contextual rewriting of transcripts to eliminate speaker-specific style while preserving meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voice anonymization techniques are effective for isolated short utterances but insufficient for long-form audio where multiple utterances from the same speaker pose greater privacy risks through content-based attacks exploiting vocabulary, syntax, and speaking style.

Method: Proposes content anonymization through contextual rewriting of transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while preserving meaning. Uses paraphrasing as a defense mechanism against content-based attacks.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness of content-based attacks on voice-anonymized speech in long-form telephone conversations. Shows that proposed content-based anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.

Conclusion: Paraphrasing is an effective defense against content-based attacks and should be adopted to ensure anonymity in long-form audio, complementing voice anonymization techniques.

Abstract: Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a
speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as
the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in
isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone
calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are
available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple
utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's
vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their
voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content
anonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the
transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while
preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation
setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on
voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based
anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.
Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against
content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure
anonymity in long-form audio.

*Simone Carnemolla,Matteo Pennisi,Chiara Russo,Simone Palazzo,Daniela Giordano,Concetto Spampinato*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SeeingSounds is a lightweight framework for audio-to-image generation that uses dual alignment between audio, language, and vision without requiring paired audio-visual data or training visual generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create audio-to-image generation that reflects natural cross-modal associations in human perception, moving beyond treating audio as text substitute or relying solely on audio-to-text mappings.

Method: Projects audio into semantic language space via frozen language encoder and contextually grounds it into visual domain using vision-language model. Uses frozen diffusion backbones with lightweight adapters, and supports fine-grained control through procedural text prompt generation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings across standard benchmarks, establishing new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual generation.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, scalable learning and interpretable control for audio-to-image generation by leveraging cognitive neuroscience-inspired dual alignment approach.

Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for
audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language,
and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual
generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or
relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment:
audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language
encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a
vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience,
reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The
model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight
adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports
fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt
generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts)
translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide
visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that
SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised
settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual
generation.

### [154] [Audio-Guided Visual Perception for Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11760)
*Yi Wang,Yinfeng Yu,Fuchun Sun,Liejun Wang,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AGVP framework improves audio-visual navigation by transforming sound from acoustic fingerprints into spatial guidance through cross-modal alignment, enhancing generalization to unheard sounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AVN methods have poor cross-source generalization, failing with unheard sounds due to memorizing spurious acoustic fingerprint-scenario correlations rather than learning true auditory-visual relationships.

Method: AGVP extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, uses it as queries to guide visual feature attention to highlight sound-source-related regions, then performs temporal modeling and policy optimization.

Result: AGVP improves navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting in AGVP reduces dependency on specific acoustic fingerprints, enabling better generalization in audio-visual embodied navigation.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously
navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While
current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor
cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths
become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen
environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment
mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies
tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations
during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound
sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound
from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The
framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then
uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting
sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling
and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on
interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency
on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP
improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior
cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.

TL;DR: Deep Research agents built on LLMs can generate dangerous forbidden knowledge reports despite LLM safety alignment, using novel jailbreak strategies like Plan Injection and Intent Hijack that exploit multi-step research capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the elevated risks of Deep Research agents in generating professional reports containing forbidden knowledge in high-stakes domains like biosecurity, where existing LLM jailbreak methods fail to target the research capabilities of these agents.

Method: Proposed two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection (injecting malicious sub-goals into agent's plan) and Intent Hijack (reframing harmful queries as academic research questions), tested across different LLMs and safety benchmarks.

Result: Experiments revealed three key findings: 1) LLM alignment fails in DR agents, 2) Multi-step planning weakens alignment creating systemic vulnerabilities, 3) DR agents bypass refusals and produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content than standalone LLMs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates fundamental misalignment in DR agents and calls for better alignment techniques specifically tailored to Deep Research agents rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform
complex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online
information, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs
with such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is
especially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as
biosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed
forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice:
simply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can
elicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the
elevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,
jailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,
as they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,
we propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects
malicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes
harmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive
experiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including
general and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key
findings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful
prompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step
planning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities
that prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass
refusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content,
compared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental
misalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to
DR agents. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: HackWorld is the first framework to evaluate computer-use agents' ability to exploit web vulnerabilities through visual interaction, testing 36 real-world applications with realistic flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional penetration testing is costly and hard to scale, while current language model agents lack visual understanding and multi-step interaction capabilities needed for modern web applications.

Method: Uses a Capture-the-Flag setup with 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks and 7 languages, featuring realistic vulnerabilities like injection flaws and authentication bypasses.

Result: State-of-the-art CUAs show concerning performance: exploitation rates below 12%, low cybersecurity awareness, failure in multi-step attack planning, and misuse of security tools.

Conclusion: Current CUAs have significant limitations in web security contexts, highlighting the need for developing more security-aware agents capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.

Abstract: Web applications are prime targets for cyberattacks as gateways to critical
services and sensitive data. Traditional penetration testing is costly and
expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web
ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern
web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and
multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet,
their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical
interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first
framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web
application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized
benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks
and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities,
authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag
(CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses
while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs
reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity
awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security
tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security
contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents
capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.

TL;DR: AI-based judge assignment algorithm (HLSE) achieves human-expert-level matching quality for venture competition judge assignments, with no statistically significant difference from human experts while offering greater efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how AI algorithms compare to human judgment in complex decision-making tasks requiring semantic understanding and domain expertise, specifically in the context of judge assignment for venture competitions.

Method: Developed Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE) algorithm and deployed it at Harvard President's Innovation Challenge, evaluating performance against human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on 309 judge-venture pairs.

Result: No statistically significant difference in assignment quality between AI and human approaches (AUC=0.48, p=0.40); algorithmic matches rated 3.90 vs manual matches 3.94 on 5-point scale. Manual assignments that took a week could be automated in hours.

Conclusion: HLSE achieves human-expert-level matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency, demonstrating AI's potential to support and enhance human decision-making in high-stakes judge assignment settings.

Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to
automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear
how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic
understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge
assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.
Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation
Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000
to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where
high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based
judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),
and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against
human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on
$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we
found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the
two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated
$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an
excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a
full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during
deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level
matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,
underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human
decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capability to emulate human personality in social experiments and address limitations of traditional psychometric methods in evaluating LLM personality simulation.

Method: Developed an end-to-end evaluation framework with individual-level analysis (stability and identifiability) and population-level analysis (progressive personality curves), proposing modifications to traditional CFA and construct validity approaches.

Result: Demonstrated the critical role of persona detail in personality simulation quality, identified marginal utility effects of persona profiles, and discovered a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation.

Conclusion: Provides operational evaluation metrics and theoretical foundation for applying LLMs in social science experiments, offering systematic framework for virtual personality evaluation.

Abstract: This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate
social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in
virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation
framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and
identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive
personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in
simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes
important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and
construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at
their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection
or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are:
proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation;
empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality
simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona
profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering
operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large
language models in social science experiments.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GS-VERSE is a novel method that integrates mesh with Gaussian Splatting for realistic 3D manipulation in VR, overcoming limitations of current techniques like tetrahedral cages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VR 3D manipulation methods have limitations including engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations that compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy.

Method: Directly integrates object's mesh with Gaussian Splatting representation for precise surface approximation, enabling realistic deformations while being physics-engine-agnostic.

Result: Statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking, with high and reliable performance across various interactions.

Conclusion: GS-VERSE delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation, showing potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

TL;DR: One-shot LiDAR global localization using a tri-layered scene graph with Gaussian semantic fields for semantic disambiguation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of repetitive and misleading landmarks in semantic registration-based global localization methods by capturing finer-grained geo-semantic information.

Method: Proposes a tri-layered 3D scene graph with continuous semantic distribution functions learned from Gaussian processes, inserted between object and metric-semantic layers for lightweight one-shot localization.

Result: Superior performance validated through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Outram-GSF pipeline effectively mitigates semantic ambiguity in global localization through continuous semantic modeling, providing a lightweight yet high-performance solution.

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

Motivation: AI agent evaluations suffer from challenges that undermine understanding of how well agents really work, with current methods often failing to reveal real-world reliability.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) Standardized evaluation harness for parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, 2) Three-dimensional analysis across models, scaffolds, and benchmarks, 3) LLM-aided log inspection to uncover unreported behaviors.

Result: Conducted 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in various domains with $40,000 cost. Found surprising insights like higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in most runs, and uncovered problematic behaviors like searching for benchmarks instead of solving tasks.

Conclusion: HAL standardizes agent evaluation and addresses common pitfalls, aiming to shift focus from benchmark performance to real-world reliability. All agent logs (2.5B tokens) are shared to enable further research.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning, and current training-free methods are limited to rigid heuristics or non-actionable analyses.

Method: Uses evolutionary process to generate think-prefixes driven by a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy-length trade-off, drastically improves safety (cutting StrongREJECT score from 27.0% to 0.7), enhances instruction following, and synergizes with existing training-based methods.

Conclusion: Think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors, and different tasks prefer specific behavioral distributions, providing a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs reasoning with task demands.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

TL;DR: OneLife framework learns symbolic world models in complex stochastic environments with minimal interaction using conditionally-activated programmatic laws in probabilistic programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning in complex, stochastic environments where agents have only "one life" to explore hostile environments without human guidance, moving beyond deterministic settings with abundant data.

Method: Uses conditionally-activated programmatic laws with precondition-effect structure within probabilistic programming framework, creating dynamic computation graphs that route inference only through relevant laws to handle complex hierarchical states.

Result: Outperforms strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios in Crafter-OO environment, successfully learning key dynamics from minimal unguided interaction and demonstrating effective planning through simulated rollouts.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown complex environments, enabling learning of stochastic dynamics with sparse rule activation.

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

*Rongzhi Zhang,Liqin Ye,Yuzhao Heng,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Lingkai Kong,Sudheer Chava,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method for precise attribute intensity control in LLMs that enables fine-grained control over specific attribute intensities using value functions and gradient-based interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods only provide directional or open-ended guidance, failing to achieve exact attribute intensities needed for diverse user expectations.

Method: Three key designs: (1) reformulating control as target-reaching problem, (2) training lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict attribute scores, (3) using gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate to specific targets.

Result: Method enables fine-grained continuous control over attribute intensities with high accuracy on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini models, and shows efficiency improvements in preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier optimization, and behavior distillation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully moves beyond simple directional alignment to provide precise attribute intensity control, demonstrating practical applications across multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys the evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA series (LLaMA 1-4) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA, LLaMA-Adapter, and QLoRA, analyzing their architectures, performance, and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive resource on LLaMA models and efficient fine-tuning strategies for ML researchers and practitioners, covering the rapid evolution of these models and specialized adaptation methods.

Method: The paper reviews LLaMA foundation models (7B-65B to 288B parameters), their architectures including multimodal and Mixture-of-Experts variants, and analyzes five PEFT methods: LoRA, LLaMA-Adapter V1/V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA.

Result: The survey provides structured analysis of model architectures, parameter counts, benchmark results (including cases where fine-tuned LLaMA outperforms larger baselines), and examines successful real-world applications in legal and medical domains.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a one-stop resource for understanding LLaMA models and PEFT methods, while identifying ongoing challenges like scaling to larger contexts and improving robustness, along with future research directions.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

### [167] [Don't Walk the Line: Boundary Guidance for Filtered Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11834)
*Sarah Ball,Andreas Haupt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary Guidance is a reinforcement learning method that fine-tunes generative models to steer generation away from classifier decision boundaries, improving both safety and utility compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning approaches that reduce classifier filtering probability often push models toward classifier decision boundaries, increasing false positives and false negatives in safety filtering.

Method: Proposed Boundary Guidance - a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin to avoid boundary regions.

Result: On jailbreak and ambiguous prompt benchmarks, Boundary Guidance improves both safety and utility of outputs according to LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Ablations show robustness across model scales and reward designs.

Conclusion: Boundary Guidance effectively addresses the limitations of standard fine-tuning by avoiding classifier decision boundaries, leading to better safety-utility tradeoffs in generative model outputs.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

*Urs Spiegelhalter,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the trade-off between learning new capabilities and avoiding catastrophic forgetting when adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining, focusing on optimal replay ratios under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to balance task performance and knowledge retention when adapting language models to new tasks, as current approaches lack clear guidelines for optimal replay ratios under computational limitations.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive empirical study using bAbI reasoning tasks, applied synthetic data generation, and systematically evaluated different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations.

Result: Identified an optimal configuration that balances task-specific performance with general knowledge retention, enabling strong task adaptation with reduced training costs.

Conclusion: Provides empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget to achieve effective task adaptation while maintaining existing knowledge.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

### [169] [Demystifying Hybrid Thinking: Can LLMs Truly Switch Between Think and No-Think?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12680)
*Shouren Wang,Wang Yang,Xianxuan Long,Qifan Wang,Vipin Chaudhary,Xiaotian Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current hybrid thinking LLMs show reasoning leakage in no-think mode. The paper identifies key factors for better controllability and proposes a training recipe that reduces output length and reasoning tokens while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid thinking LLMs should efficiently switch between reasoning and direct answering, but current implementations suffer from reasoning behaviors leaking into no-think mode, compromising efficiency.

Method: Analyzed factors influencing controllability and proposed a practical training recipe based on four key findings: data scale, using different questions for think/no-think answers, moderate no-think data increase, and two-phase training strategy.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces no-think output length (from 1085 to 585 on MATH500) and reasoning-supportive tokens like "wait" (from 5917 to 522 on MATH500) while maintaining accuracy in both modes.

Conclusion: Current hybrid thinking has controllability limitations, but the identified factors and proposed training strategy offer effective directions for improving mode separation and efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

### [170] [MosaicDiff: Training-free Structural Pruning for Diffusion Model Acceleration Reflecting Pretraining Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11962)
*Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Cong Zeng,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff is a novel framework that aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration through trajectory-aware structural pruning, achieving significant speed-ups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion acceleration methods overlook the distinct learning speed phases during pretraining, which could be leveraged for more effective pruning strategies.

Method: Trajectory-aware structural pruning that adapts pruning aggressiveness based on pretraining learning stages - conservative for fast-learning middle stage, aggressive for slow-learning early/later stages.

Result: Achieves significant sampling speed-ups on DiT and SDXL while maintaining output quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

Conclusion: Provides a new viewpoint for efficient and robust training-free diffusion acceleration by harmonizing pretraining dynamics with accelerated sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

*Yi-Chung Chen,David I. Inouye,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel generative classifier using visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling as an alternative to diffusion-based methods, offering better computational efficiency and unique properties like explainability and resistance to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative classifiers are dominated by diffusion-based models which have high computational costs, limiting scalability and understanding of generative classification approaches.

Method: Proposed Adaptive VAR Classifier+ (A-VARC+) built on visual autoregressive modeling, which provides tractable likelihood and enables efficient inference.

Result: Achieves superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed compared to diffusion-based methods, with additional benefits of visual explainability and inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: VAR-based generative classifiers offer a practical and scalable alternative to diffusion methods with unique advantages including computational efficiency, explainability, and robustness in incremental learning scenarios.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sharp minima can correlate with better generalization when models are regularized, challenging the traditional belief that flat minima always indicate better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, questioning the conventional wisdom that flat minima always correlate with better generalization in deep neural networks.

Method: Conducted extensive empirical studies across single-objective optimization to modern image classification tasks, examining models with various regularization techniques (SAM, weight decay, data augmentation).

Result: Found that sharper minima often emerge with regularization and can coincide with better generalization, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Unregularized baselines converge to flatter minima but perform worse across safety metrics.

Conclusion: Function complexity, not flatness alone, governs solution geometry. Sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases under regularization, calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning diffusion models when only corrupted or noisy observations are available remains challenging, despite their power as generative priors for high-dimensional inverse problems.

Method: Proposed DiffEM method uses Expectation-Maximization with conditional diffusion models - reconstructing clean data from observations in E-step, then refining the conditional diffusion model in M-step.

Result: Theoretical monotonic convergence guarantees under appropriate statistical conditions. Demonstrated effectiveness through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: DiffEM provides a principled approach for training diffusion models from corrupted data with theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: MAPS is a computational tool that uses attribution maps from neural networks to create explanation-masked images, enabling comparison of human and model vision strategies with minimal behavioral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable method for measuring and comparing visual information selection strategies in humans and artificial neural networks, avoiding exhaustive psychophysics experiments.

Method: MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) with limited pixel budgets, then compares human accuracies on these minimal images with full stimuli accuracies across competing ANN interpretability methods.

Result: MAPS reliably recovers ground-truth model similarity in silico and identifies ANN-explanation combinations that best align with human and macaque vision, achieving Bubble mask behavioral validity with fewer trials.

Conclusion: MAPS provides a principled, scalable framework for evaluating interpretability methods and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard using minimal behavioral data.

Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual
information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure
directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a
behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations
derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision.
MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and
compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited
pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled
way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In
silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the
ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing
which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to
humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose
explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the
behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral
trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of
behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics
while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human
behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: DISTAR is a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that combines autoregressive language modeling with masked diffusion in discrete residual vector quantization space, enabling robust, controllable synthesis without forced alignment or duration prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches interleaving autoregressive sketchers with diffusion refiners are brittle under distribution shift and offer limited controllability. The authors aim to create a more robust and controllable TTS system.

Method: DISTAR operates in discrete RVQ code space, using an AR language model to draft block-level tokens followed by parallel masked-diffusion infilling to complete each block, enabling long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism.

Result: DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency while maintaining rich output diversity. It supports explicit control via classifier-free guidance, variable bit-rate, and RVQ layer pruning.

Conclusion: The discrete code space approach tightly coupling AR and diffusion models enables high-quality, controllable TTS synthesis that is robust to distribution shifts and offers flexible inference-time control mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with
diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown
promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited
levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech
framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization
(RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked
diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely,
DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then
performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to
complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise
parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space
affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under
both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports
trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and
controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive
experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art
zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style
consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity. Audio samples are

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Proposes GTCTV-DPC, a novel tensor completion framework using monotone inclusion paradigm that unifies low-rank priors with deep pseudo-contractive denoisers, with proven global convergence and superior performance at low sampling rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor completion methods face challenges with missing data and rely on unrealistic assumptions about deep denoisers acting as proximal operators, lacking rigorous convergence guarantees.

Method: Developed GTCTV-DPC algorithm based on Davis-Yin splitting scheme, combining generalized low-rank priors with deep pseudo-contractive denoisers within a monotone inclusion framework that extends beyond convex optimization.

Result: GTCTV-DPC consistently outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low sampling rates, with rigorous global convergence established.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a theoretically sound and practically effective solution for tensor completion, addressing limitations of existing methods while demonstrating superior performance across various scenarios.

Abstract: Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for
downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are
naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global
low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical
performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence
alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal
operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in
the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with
deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex
optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV
DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing
methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low
sampling rates.

TL;DR: This study applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict celebrity demographics from Urdu tweets of their followers, achieving best results for gender prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media analysis has focused on high-resource languages like English, leaving Urdu largely unexplored despite its significance in celebrity profiling through follower linguistic patterns.

Method: Collected Urdu tweets from followers of subcontinent celebrities, preprocessed data, and trained multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forests, CNNs, and LSTMs.

Result: Best performance achieved for gender prediction with cRank of 0.65 and accuracy of 0.65, with moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction.

Conclusion: Follower-based linguistic features can be effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.

Abstract: Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a
platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities
are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and
professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an
opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and
social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and
interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be
used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this
field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu
largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to
the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from
followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple
algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support
Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long
Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance
was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of
0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction.
These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be
effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for
demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.

Motivation: To understand how policymakers adapt political communication on social media during wartime, specifically examining the first large-scale European war in the social media era.

Method: Used unique dataset of Telegram public posts from Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), analyzing changes in communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion.

Result: Sharp increase in Telegram activity after invasion, especially among ruling-party policymakers. Ukrainians initially focused on war topics but declined over time; Russians avoided war discussions and emphasized unrelated topics like Western crises as distraction. Differences found between large/small parties and individual policymakers.

Conclusion: The study reveals how policymakers adapt to wartime communication challenges and provides critical insights into online political discourse dynamics during war.

Abstract: This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during
the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the
social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from
Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in
communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's
2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram
activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers.
Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this
emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided
war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western
crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in
communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual
policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime
communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of
online political discourse during times of war.

TL;DR: Replacing single-layer linear projections with more complex feedforward networks (FFNs) in multi-vector dense retrieval models like ColBERT improves performance by over 2 NDCG@10 points across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The MaxSim operator in multi-vector models imposes limitations on gradient flows during training, suggesting that simple linear projections may be suboptimal for this setting.

Method: Systematically evaluated alternative projection blocks including deeper non-linear FFN blocks, GLU blocks, and skip-connections to replace the traditional single-layer linear projection in ColBERT.

Result: Many projection variants outperformed original linear projections, with best variants increasing average performance by over 2 NDCG@10 points across retrieval benchmarks. Upscaled intermediate projections and residual connections were particularly important.

Conclusion: Replacing linear layers with better-designed projections is a robust, drop-in upgrade for ColBERT models, with consistent improvements across random seeds and multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a
single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual
vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on
the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a
simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this
setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from
replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative
feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU
blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the
design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that
better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance
of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the
original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing
average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2
NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual
parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this
empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled
intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation
studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform
the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming
our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across
random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT
models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.

Motivation: To understand the mechanism of parametric injection in PRAG and clarify its role in enhancing LLM-document interaction compared to traditional RAG approaches.

Method: Systematic study of PRAG, analyzing how parameterized documents capture semantic information and their interaction with textual documents in the input context.

Result: Parameterized documents alone yield inferior performance compared to text-level interaction but encode high-level document information that enhances model understanding when combined with textual documents.

Conclusion: Joint use of parameterized and textual documents is recommended, with emphasis on increasing information content in parametric representations for better PRAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric
retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters
(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during
inference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric
level. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is
more efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document
interaction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric
injection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic
study of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that
parameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,
and relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction
at text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level
document information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents
within the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual
documents, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and
become more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either
source alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents
and advocate for increasing the information content of parametric
representations to advance PRAG.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in real-world multimodal embedding applications, including limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps that previous CLIP-based and vision-language models face.

Method: Uses multi-stage training with content-aware progressive training for cross-modal proficiency, collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training with knowledge distillation from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings, and stochastic specialization with dataset-driven pattern matching for flexibility.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in retrieval tasks and delivers significant improvements in online scenarios: +0.158% 7-day LT gain and +0.144% 14-day LT gain in Douyin-Selected, and +0.08% AUC gain in Douyin feed rank model.

Conclusion: SAIL-Embedding successfully addresses multimodal embedding challenges through tailored training strategies, demonstrating strong performance in both offline retrieval tasks and real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations
that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the
evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language
models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world
applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,
unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we
introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that
addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural
design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme
to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.
Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the
model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched
cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement
training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios
by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while
mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic
specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training
flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding
achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval
tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated
with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a
crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model
delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the
Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features
produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.

### [182] [Task-Aware Reduction for Scalable LLM-Database Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11813)
*Marcus Emmanuel Barnes,Taher A. Ghaleb,Safwat Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper argues for treating LLM token budgets as attention budgets and prioritizing task-aware text reduction as a key design principle for language-data systems, rather than feeding verbose real-world data directly into LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world text-rich data (logs, telemetry, monitoring streams) is too verbose, noisy, and costly to feed directly into LLMs, making current LLM-data integration unsustainable and misaligned with task objectives.

Method: Proposes input-side text reduction as attention allocation - prioritizing information most relevant to downstream tasks rather than simple compression. Outlines research challenges for benchmarks, adaptive reduction pipelines, and token-budget-aware preprocessing.

Result: Presents a vision for scalable, accurate, and sustainable LLM-data integration by channeling scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in noisy workflows.

Conclusion: Task-aware text reduction should be elevated as a first-class design principle for language-data systems to enable effective and sustainable LLM applications in data-intensive workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive
workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the
effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and
noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring
streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally
unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in
LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but
the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In
this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention
budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design
principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as
compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most
relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building
benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating
token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our
vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in
noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable
LLM--data integration.
