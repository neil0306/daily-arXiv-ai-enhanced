While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic\nentropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint\ntreatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with\nnovel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,\ncomputing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw\ncandidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian\nword-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315\nEnglish words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%\nsuccess rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward\nChecking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms\nversus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3\npercentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic\nCSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint\nrecovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates\n88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP\nprinciples transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from\nlinguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source\nimplementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides\nreproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP\ntreatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,\nrobustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance\nbenchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques\noutperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for\nstructured puzzle-solving domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies, achieving significant improvements over existing approaches.", "motivation": "Existing Wordle solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, creating a need for principled constraint satisfaction approaches.", "method": "Introduces CSP-Aware Entropy (computing information gain after constraint propagation) and Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints.", "result": "CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking with 46% faster runtime.

This paper presents a comparative study of\nadversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard\nadversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more\nresilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering\n(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text\ninto a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then\nquantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein\ndistance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the\nclassifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our\nPIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and\nsentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional\nadversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against\nsemantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its\nTrue Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In\nstark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the\ndiscrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation.\nIt maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively\nneutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance\ndemonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than\nmerely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine\nrobustness in the adversarial arms race.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces PIFE, a novel framework for detecting AI-generated text that is robust against adversarial attacks, especially semantic paraphrasing, outperforming conventional adversarial training.", "motivation": "The dual-use problem of advanced LLMs necessitates reliable AI-generated text detection, but current detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like paraphrasing that evade statistical detection.", "method": "Proposes Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering (PIFE) - a multi-stage normalization pipeline that transforms text to standardized form, then quantifies transformation magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein distance and semantic similarity as features for classification.", "result": "Conventional adversarial training fails against semantic attacks (48.8% TPR at 1% FPR), while PIFE maintains 82.6% TPR under same conditions, effectively neutralizing sophisticated semantic attacks.", "conclusion": "Explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts through feature engineering is more effective than merely training on adversarial examples for achieving genuine robustness in AI text detection."}}
