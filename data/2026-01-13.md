### [1] [TeleMem: Building Long-Term and Multimodal Memory for Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06037)
*Chunliang Chen,Ming Guan,Xiao Lin,Jiaxu Li,Qiyi Wang,Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Changzhi Sun,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeleMem is a unified long-term multimodal memory system for LLMs that improves dialogue coherence, reduces hallucinations, and enables efficient video understanding through narrative extraction, structured writing, and ReAct reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-term interactions due to limited attention over extended dialogue histories. Existing RAG approaches lack reliable mechanisms for updating/refining stored memories, leading to schema-driven hallucinations, inefficient write operations, and minimal support for multimodal reasoning.

Method: 1) Narrative dynamic extraction to maintain coherent user profiles with only dialogue-grounded information; 2) Structured writing pipeline that batches, retrieves, clusters, and consolidates memory entries; 3) Multimodal memory module with ReAct-style reasoning (observe, think, act) for video understanding.

Result: TeleMem surpasses state-of-the-art Mem0 baseline with 19% higher accuracy, 43% fewer tokens, and 2.1x speedup on ZH-4O long-term role-play gaming benchmark.

Conclusion: TeleMem effectively addresses LLM memory limitations by providing a unified system for long-term multimodal memory management, improving accuracy, efficiency, and speed in sustained interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks but struggle to sustain long-term interactions due to limited attention over extended dialogue histories. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue but lacks reliable mechanisms for updating or refining stored memories, leading to schema-driven hallucinations, inefficient write operations, and minimal support for multimodal reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose TeleMem, a unified long-term and multimodal memory system that maintains coherent user profiles through narrative dynamic extraction, ensuring that only dialogue-grounded information is preserved. TeleMem further introduces a structured writing pipeline that batches, retrieves, clusters, and consolidates memory entries, substantially improving storage efficiency, reducing token usage, and accelerating memory operations. Additionally, a multimodal memory module combined with ReAct-style reasoning equips the system with a closed-loop observe, think, and act process that enables accurate understanding of complex video content in long-term contexts. Experimental results show that TeleMem surpasses the state-of-the-art Mem0 baseline with 19% higher accuracy, 43% fewer tokens, and a 2.1x speedup on the ZH-4O long-term role-play gaming benchmark.

### [2] [Operation Veja: Fixing Fundamental Concepts Missing from Modern Roleplaying Training Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06039)
*Yueze Liu,Ajay Nagi Reddy Kumdam,Ronit Kanjilal,Hao Yang,Yichi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes VEJA framework (Values, Experiences, Judgments, Abilities) for character authenticity in roleplaying models, showing it outperforms current methods through a pilot study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current roleplaying models fail to create believable characters due to training paradigms that overlook the dynamic interplay of a character's internal world. Existing approaches (RAG, fact-based priming, literature-based learning, synthetic data) have limitations in modeling deliberative, value-conflicted reasoning.

Method: Proposes VEJA framework as a new paradigm for data curation focusing on four core concepts: Values, Experiences, Judgments, and Abilities. Conducts a pilot study comparing manually curated VEJA-grounded dataset against state-of-the-art synthetic baseline using LLM-as-judge evaluation.

Result: The VEJA-grounded dataset demonstrates a significant quality gap compared to the synthetic baseline, suggesting conceptually grounded data curation enables better character authenticity and narrative continuity.

Conclusion: A shift toward conceptually grounded data curation, as embodied by VEJA, is necessary for creating roleplaying agents with genuine depth and narrative continuity. The framework addresses systemic limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Modern roleplaying models are increasingly sophisticated, yet they consistently struggle to capture the essence of believable, engaging characters. We argue this failure stems from training paradigms that overlook the dynamic interplay of a character's internal world. Current approaches, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fact-based priming, literature-based learning, and synthetic data generation, exhibit recurring limitations in modeling the deliberative, value-conflicted reasoning that defines human interaction. In this paper, we identify four core concepts essential for character authenticity: Values, Experiences, Judgments, and Abilities (VEJA). We propose the VEJA framework as a new paradigm for data curation that addresses these systemic limitations. To illustrate the qualitative ceiling enabled by our framework, we present a pilot study comparing a manually curated, VEJA-grounded dataset against a state-of-the-art synthetic baseline. Using an LLM-as-judge evaluation, our findings demonstrate a significant quality gap, suggesting that a shift toward conceptually grounded data curation, as embodied by VEJA, is necessary for creating roleplaying agents with genuine depth and narrative continuity.

### [3] [Lexical and Statistical Analysis of Bangla Newspaper and Literature: A Corpus-Driven Study on Diversity, Readability, and NLP Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06041)
*Pramit Bhattacharyya,Arnab Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bangla literary texts show higher lexical diversity, structural complexity, and readability difficulty compared to newspaper texts, with literary data improving downstream NLP task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare linguistic properties and complexity between Bangla literary and newspaper texts, and understand how literary data affects NLP model performance.

Method: Corpus analysis of Vacaspati (literature) and IndicCorp (newspaper) using type-token ratio, hapax legomena ratio, bigram diversity, syllable/word lengths, Zipf's Law adherence, n-gram modeling with perplexity, and readability indices (Flesch, Coleman-Liau).

Result: Literary corpus shows higher lexical richness, structural variation, perplexity, entropy, and complexity; adheres better to Zipf's Law; and improves downstream task performance when combined with newspaper data.

Conclusion: Bangla literary texts are linguistically richer and more complex than newspaper texts, and incorporating literary data enhances NLP model capabilities across various tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive corpus-driven analysis of Bangla literary and newspaper texts to investigate their lexical diversity, structural complexity and readability. We undertook Vacaspati and IndicCorp, which are the most extensive literature and newspaper-only corpora for Bangla. We examine key linguistic properties, including the type-token ratio (TTR), hapax legomena ratio (HLR), Bigram diversity, average syllable and word lengths, and adherence to Zipfs Law, for both newspaper (IndicCorp) and literary corpora (Vacaspati).For all the features, such as Bigram Diversity and HLR, despite its smaller size, the literary corpus exhibits significantly higher lexical richness and structural variation. Additionally, we tried to understand the diversity of corpora by building n-gram models and measuring perplexity. Our findings reveal that literary corpora have higher perplexity than newspaper corpora, even for similar sentence sizes. This trend can also be observed for the English newspaper and literature corpus, indicating its generalizability. We also examined how the perfor- mance of models on downstream tasks is influenced by the inclusion of literary data alongside newspaper data. Our findings suggest that inte- grating literary data with newspapers improves the performance of models on various downstream tasks. We have also demonstrated that a literary corpus adheres more closely to global word distribution proper- ties, such as Zipfs law, than a newspaper corpus or a merged corpus of both literary and newspaper texts. Literature corpora also have higher entropy and lower redundancy values compared to a newspaper corpus. We also further assess the readability using Flesch and Coleman-Liau in- dices, showing that literary texts are more complex.

### [4] [Reinforcement Learning for Chain of Thought Compression with One-Domain-to-All Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06052)
*Hanyu Li,Jiangshan Duo,Bofei Gao,Hailin Zhang,Sujian Li,Xiaotie Deng,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A soft RL compression method reduces CoT reasoning length by 20-40% while maintaining or improving accuracy, with strong cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs creates an "overthinking trap" with excessive computational cost and latency for unreliable accuracy gains. Prior global static controls risk penalizing necessary reasoning.

Method: Sample-level, soft reinforcement learning compression that penalizes inefficiently long rollouts, but only on problems where the model has already mastered and produced a more concise rollout.

Result: Reduces average response length by 20-40% with comparable or higher accuracy. Shows strong cross-domain generalization - training on math leads to spontaneous shortening on unseen tasks like code, instruction following, and QA.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a stable post-training curriculum (accuracy-compression-accuracy) that produces more accurate and concise reasoning models, arguing such compression should be a standard phase in developing efficient reasoning models.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models often creates an "overthinking trap," leading to excessive computational cost and latency for unreliable accuracy gains. Prior work has typically relied on global, static controls that risk penalizing necessary reasoning. We introduce a sample-level, soft reinforcement learning compression method that penalizes inefficiently long rollouts, but only on problems where the model has already mastered and already produced a more concise rollout. Our experiments show that this method reduces average response length by 20-40% with comparable or higher accuracy. Crucially, the compression exhibits strong cross-domain generalization; a model trained on math spontaneously shortens responses on unseen tasks like code, instruction following, and general knowledge QA, with stable or improved accuracy. We demonstrate a stable post-training curriculum (accuracy-compression-accuracy) that can ultimately produce models that are more accurate and reason more concisely, arguing that such compression method should be a standard phase in developing efficient reasoning models.

*Alberto Purpura,Emily Chen,Swapnil Shinde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-stage workflow using fine-tuned reasoning LLMs to automatically identify compliance issues in marketing content without external knowledge representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in solving complex problems, and there's a need to leverage their reasoning capabilities to automate the review process of marketing content for compliance with requirements.

Method: Proposes a multi-stage workflow using fine-tuned reasoning LLMs. Compares different fine-tuning strategies (SFT and GRPO), evaluates training small LLMs to generate reasoning tokens before final response, and examines how different reward function combinations affect GRPO performance.

Result: The paper presents a novel approach for automatic compliance issue identification without external knowledge representation, with comparative analysis of different fine-tuning strategies and their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned reasoning LLMs for automating marketing content compliance review, with insights into optimal fine-tuning strategies and reward function design.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results when tasked with solving complex problems. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a multi-stage workflow that leverages the capabilities of fine-tuned reasoning LLMs to assist in the review process of marketing content, making sure they comply with a given list of requirements. The contributions of this paper are the following: (i) we present a novel approach -- that does not rely on any external knowledge representation -- for the automatic identification of compliance issues in textual content; (ii) compare the effectiveness of different fine-tuning strategies like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in training models to solve this problem; (iii) we evaluate the effectiveness of training small LLMs to generate reasoning tokens before providing their final response; (iv) we evaluate how the choice and combinations of different reward functions affects the performance of a model trained with GRPO.

### [6] [AzeroS: Extending LLM to Speech with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06086)
*Yiwen Shao,Wei Liu,Jiahong Li,Tianzi Wang,Kun Wei,Meng Yu,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AZeroS is a speech-LLM trained with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning (SIFT) that eliminates need for task-specific instruction data, achieving SOTA performance with minimal training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-LLMs require large-scale task-specific instruction-tuning datasets which are time-consuming to curate and lead to poor generalization to unseen tasks.

Method: Proposes SIFT paradigm where supervision signals are generated by frozen LLM using textual representations of speech. AZeroS uses Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with frozen LLM/audio encoders, updating only two lightweight projection modules (23.8M params each) trained on 25K hours of ASR speech and 3K hours of paralinguistic speech.

Result: AZeroS achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic and paralinguistic benchmarks including VoiceBench, AIR-Bench Foundation (Speech), and AIR-Bench Chat (Speech) despite minimal training cost and modest data scale.

Conclusion: SIFT paradigm provides theoretically best generalization to unseen tasks without task-specific instruction data, enabling efficient training of high-performance speech-LLMs with minimal parameters updated.

Abstract: Extending large language models (LLMs) to the speech domain has recently gained significant attention. A typical approach connects a pretrained LLM with an audio encoder through a projection module and trains the resulting model on large-scale, task-specific instruction-tuning datasets. However, curating such instruction-tuning data for specific requirements is time-consuming, and models trained in this manner often generalize poorly to unseen tasks. In this work, we first formulate that the strongest generalization of a speech-LLM is achieved when it is trained with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning (SIFT), in which supervision signals are generated by a frozen LLM using textual representations of speech as input. Our proposed SIFT paradigm eliminates the need for collecting task-specific question-answer pairs and yields the theoretically best generalization to unseen tasks. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce AZeroS (Auden Zero-instruction-tuned Speech-LLM), which is trained on speech-text pairs derived from publicly available corpora, including approximately 25,000 hours of speech with ASR transcripts and 3,000 hours of speech with paralinguistic labels. Built upon Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, the model updates only two lightweight projection modules (23.8 million parameters each), while keeping both the LLM and audio encoders frozen. Despite the minimal training cost and modest data scale, AZeroS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both semantic and paralinguistic benchmarks, including VoiceBench, AIR-Bench Foundation (Speech), and AIR-Bench Chat (Speech).

### [7] [Is Sanskrit the most token-efficient language? A quantitative study using GPT, Gemini, and SentencePiece](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06142)
*Anshul Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sanskrit shows ~2x more token efficiency than English/Hindi in LLM tokenization, with latest tokenizers reducing but not eliminating bias against non-English languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify Sanskrit's hypothesized higher meaning density per token compared to English/Hindi, and investigate tokenizer bias that penalizes non-English users with inflated token counts.

Method: Used parallel Bhagavad Gita verses in Sanskrit, English, and Hindi; tested various tokenizers (SentencePiece, GPT models, Gemini); measured token count, characters per token, and tokens per character.

Result: Sanskrit shows ~2x fewer tokens than English/Hindi under unbiased baseline; English/Hindi translations of Sanskrit commentary had ~20x more tokens; latest tokenizers reduce bias but still don't fully capture Sanskrit's compactness.

Conclusion: Tokenizers show bias against non-English languages, inflating costs; Sanskrit demonstrates potential for compact encoding; improvements needed for fairer tokenizer design across languages.

Abstract: Tokens are the basic units of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs rely on tokenizers to segment text into these tokens, and tokenization is the primary determinant of computational and inference cost. Sanskrit, one of the oldest languages, is hypothesized to express more meaning per token due to its morphology and grammar rules; however, no prior work has quantified this. We use a dataset of 701 parallel verses of the Bhagavad Gita, which comprises three languages-Sanskrit, English, and Hindi along with transliteration of Sanskrit into English. We test tokenizers including SentencePiece (SPM), older GPT models, and the latest generation tokenizers from Gemini and GPT. We use metrics of token count, characters per token (token efficiency), and tokens per character (token cost). Results show a ~2x difference in token counts between Sanskrit and English/Hindi under the unbiased SPM baseline. English/Hindi translations of Sanskrit commentary resulted in an approximately 20x increase in token count. GPT o200k base (latest, used by GPT-4o) and Gemini (latest) reduce bias by a significant degree compared to GPT cl100k base (used until GPT-4), but still fail to fully capture Sanskrit's compactness. This matters because there might be a penalty bias for non-English users, which inflates the token count. This research provides a foundation for improving future tokenizer design and shows the potential of Sanskrit for highly compact encoding, saving on cost while speeding up training and inference.

### [8] [Amory: Building Coherent Narrative-Driven Agent Memory through Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06282)
*Yue Zhou,Xiaobo Guo,Belhassen Bayar,Srinivasan H. Sengamedu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amory: A working memory framework for long-term conversational agents that actively constructs structured memory representations through episodic narratives, momentum consolidation, and semantic memory, achieving SOTA performance with 50% faster response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term conversational agents face computational scalability challenges when repeatedly processing entire conversation histories. Current memory frameworks fragment conversations into isolated embeddings/graphs and retrieve via RAG, but fail to capture the subtlety and coherence of human memory.

Method: Amory actively constructs structured memory representations through: 1) organizing conversational fragments into episodic narratives, 2) consolidating memories with momentum, 3) semanticizing peripheral facts into semantic memory, and 4) employing coherence-driven reasoning over narrative structures at retrieval time.

Result: On LOCOMO benchmark for long-term reasoning, Amory achieves considerable improvements over previous SOTA, with performance comparable to full context reasoning while reducing response time by 50%. Momentum-aware consolidation enhances response quality, and coherence-driven retrieval provides superior memory coverage.

Conclusion: Amory demonstrates that actively constructing structured memory representations through episodic narratives and coherence-driven reasoning can overcome scalability challenges in long-term conversational agents while maintaining human-like memory coherence.

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents face a fundamental scalability challenge as interactions extend over time: repeatedly processing entire conversation histories becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches attempt to solve this through memory frameworks that predominantly fragment conversations into isolated embeddings or graph representations and retrieve relevant ones in a RAG style. While computationally efficient, these methods often treat memory formation minimally and fail to capture the subtlety and coherence of human memory. We introduce Amory, a working memory framework that actively constructs structured memory representations through enhancing agentic reasoning during offline time. Amory organizes conversational fragments into episodic narratives, consolidates memories with momentum, and semanticizes peripheral facts into semantic memory. At retrieval time, the system employs coherence-driven reasoning over narrative structures. Evaluated on the LOCOMO benchmark for long-term reasoning, Amory achieves considerable improvements over previous state-of-the-art, with performance comparable to full context reasoning while reducing response time by 50%. Analysis shows that momentum-aware consolidation significantly enhances response quality, while coherence-driven retrieval provides superior memory coverage compared to embedding-based approaches.

### [9] [How well can off-the-shelf LLMs elucidate molecular structures from mass spectra using chain-of-thought reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06289)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu Wei,Lin Liu,Hao Xu,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for interpreting mass spectra but fail to achieve chemical accuracy in molecular structure prediction despite using expert reasoning frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass spectrometry is powerful for identifying small molecules, but determining complete molecular structures from MS/MS data remains challenging due to complex fragmentation patterns and vast chemical space. Recent LLM progress shows promise for scientific reasoning tasks, but their chemical interpretation capabilities are unclear.

Method: Introduced a Chain-of-Thought prompting framework that formalizes expert chemists' reasoning steps (DBE analysis, neutral loss identification, fragment assembly) into structured prompts. Evaluated multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3 series) in zero-shot setting using MassSpecGym dataset.

Result: LLMs can produce syntactically valid SMILES and partially plausible structures, but fail to achieve chemical accuracy or properly link reasoning to correct molecular predictions. Evaluation across SMILES validity, formula consistency, and structural similarity metrics reveals current limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs show interpretive potential for mass spectral data but have significant limitations in achieving chemically accurate molecular predictions. Future work should combine domain knowledge with reinforcement learning to achieve chemically grounded AI reasoning.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical technique for identifying small molecules, yet determining complete molecular structures directly from tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) remains a long-standing challenge due to complex fragmentation patterns and the vast diversity of chemical space. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise for reasoning-intensive scientific tasks, but their capability for chemical interpretation is still unclear. In this work, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting framework and benchmark that evaluate how LLMs reason about mass spectral data to predict molecular structures. We formalize expert chemists' reasoning steps-such as double bond equivalent (DBE) analysis, neutral loss identification, and fragment assembly-into structured prompts and assess multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3 series) in a zero-shot setting using the MassSpecGym dataset. Our evaluation across metrics of SMILES validity, formula consistency, and structural similarity reveals that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and partially plausible structures, they fail to achieve chemical accuracy or link reasoning to correct molecular predictions. These findings highlight both the interpretive potential and the current limitations of LLM-based reasoning for molecular elucidation, providing a foundation for future work that combines domain knowledge and reinforcement learning to achieve chemically grounded AI reasoning.

*Trisha Das,Mandis Beigi,Jacob Aptekar,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces eligibility criteria amendment prediction as a new NLP task to forecast whether clinical trial eligibility criteria will be amended, with AMEND++ benchmark datasets and CAMLM pretraining method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trial amendments cause delays, increased costs, and administrative burden, with eligibility criteria being the most commonly amended component. There's a need to predict amendments to improve trial design efficiency.

Method: Proposes eligibility criteria amendment prediction task, releases AMEND++ benchmark suite (AMEND and AMEND_LLM datasets), and introduces Change-Aware Masked Language Modeling (CAMLM) - a revision-aware pretraining strategy that leverages historical edits.

Result: CAMLM consistently improves amendment prediction across diverse baselines, enabling more robust and cost-effective clinical trial design.

Conclusion: The proposed task, benchmark datasets, and CAMLM method provide effective tools for predicting clinical trial eligibility criteria amendments, potentially reducing delays and costs in clinical trial design.

Abstract: Clinical trial amendments frequently introduce delays, increased costs, and administrative burden, with eligibility criteria being the most commonly amended component. We introduce \textit{eligibility criteria amendment prediction}, a novel NLP task that aims to forecast whether the eligibility criteria of an initial trial protocol will undergo future amendments. To support this task, we release $\texttt{AMEND++}$, a benchmark suite comprising two datasets: $\texttt{AMEND}$, which captures eligibility-criteria version histories and amendment labels from public clinical trials, and $\verb|AMEND_LLM|$, a refined subset curated using an LLM-based denoising pipeline to isolate substantive changes. We further propose $\textit{Change-Aware Masked Language Modeling}$ (CAMLM), a revision-aware pretraining strategy that leverages historical edits to learn amendment-sensitive representations. Experiments across diverse baselines show that CAMLM consistently improves amendment prediction, enabling more robust and cost-effective clinical trial design.

### [11] [Why LoRA Fails to Forget: Regularized Low-Rank Adaptation Against Backdoors in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06305)
*Hoang-Chau Luong,Lingwei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA's vulnerability to backdoor attacks is fundamentally spectral, not just low-rank. The paper introduces RoRA with spectral regularization to improve forgetting of poisoned behaviors while maintaining clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA is widely used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning but fails to remove backdoor behaviors from poisoned pretrained models. The common belief attributes this to low rank limitations, but the authors argue the real issue is spectral - LoRA updates lack sufficient spectral strength and have poor spectral alignment with clean tasks while retaining overlap with trigger-sensitive subspaces.

Method: The paper introduces Regularized Low-Rank Adaptation (RoRA) which improves forgetting through three key components: (1) clean-strengthened regularization to increase spectral strength, (2) trigger-insensitive constraints to correct spectral alignment, and (3) post-training spectral rescaling. The authors establish a critical scaling threshold for suppressing trigger-induced activations.

Result: Experiments across multiple NLP benchmarks and attack settings show that RoRA substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy. The method demonstrates that spectral properties, not just rank limitations, are key to LoRA's vulnerability to backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: LoRA's vulnerability to backdoor attacks is fundamentally spectral rather than just low-rank. By addressing spectral strength and alignment issues through RoRA's regularization approach, it's possible to effectively remove backdoor behaviors while maintaining parameter efficiency and clean task performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, but it is notably ineffective at removing backdoor behaviors from poisoned pretrained models when fine-tuning on clean dataset. Contrary to the common belief that this weakness is caused primarily by low rank, we show that LoRA's vulnerability is fundamentally spectral. Our analysis identifies two key factors: LoRA updates (i) possess insufficient spectral strength, with singular values far below those of pretrained weights, and (ii) exhibit unfavorable spectral alignment, weakly matching clean-task directions while retaining overlap with trigger-sensitive subspaces. We further establish a critical scaling threshold beyond which LoRA can theoretically suppress trigger-induced activations, and we show empirically that standard LoRA rarely reaches this regime. We introduce Regularized Low-Rank Adaptation (RoRA), which improves forgetting by increasing spectral strength and correcting alignment through clean-strengthened regularization, trigger-insensitive constraints, and post-training spectral rescaling. Experiments across multiple NLP benchmarks and attack settings show that RoRA substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy.

*Ishika Agarwal,Zhenlin He,Dhruva Patil,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO-style fine-tuning with MTQE reward models improves idiom translation by ~14 points, with cross-lingual generalization benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-compositional expressions like idioms pose challenges for neural machine translation because their meanings cannot be derived from individual words alone, requiring better handling of figurative and cultural language.

Method: GRPO-style fine-tuning using Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) models as reward functions, trained on Chinese and Hindi idiom datasets to improve idiom translation capabilities.

Result: Idiom translation improves by ~14 points, general non-idiomatic translation improves by ~8 points, and cross-lingual translation (trained on one language, evaluated on another) improves by ~6 points.

Conclusion: The work quantifies the non-compositional translation gap and provides insights for developing LLMs with stronger cross-cultural and figurative language understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Non-compositional expressions (e.g., idioms, proverbs, and metaphors) pose significant challenges for neural machine translation systems because their meanings cannot be derived from individual words alone. These expressions encode rich, cultural meaning, and have both figurative and literal meanings, making accurate translation difficult. Because models are fairly good at translating compositional text, we investigate GRPO-style fine-tuning using Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) models as reward functions to train models to better translate idioms. Using Chinese and Hindi idiom datasets, we find that idiom translation abilities improve by ~14 points, general, non-idiomatic translation implicitly improves by ~8 points, and cross-lingual translation abilities (trained on one language, evaluated on another) improves by ~6 points. Overall, our work quantifies the non-compositional translation gap and offers insights for developing LLMs with stronger cross-cultural and figurative language understanding.

### [14] [Annotating Dimensions of Social Perception in Text: The First Sentence-Level Dataset of Warmth and Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06316)
*Mutaz Ayesh,Saif M. Mohammad,Nedjma Ousidhoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First sentence-level dataset (W&C-Sent) annotated for warmth and competence dimensions, with 1,600+ English sentence-target pairs from social media, enabling analysis of trust, sociability, and competence in text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warmth and competence are fundamental social evaluation dimensions in psychology, but NLP research has only addressed them through word-level lexicons that miss contextual expression in larger text units and discourse.

Method: Created W&C-Sent dataset with over 1,600 English sentence-target pairs annotated for trust, sociability, and competence. Collected social media sentences expressing attitudes about individuals/groups, implemented detailed annotation and quality-control procedures, and evaluated LLMs on identifying these dimensions.

Result: Successfully developed the first sentence-level dataset for warmth and competence analysis, providing a new resource for computational social science research and enabling evaluation of LLMs' ability to detect these social dimensions in text.

Conclusion: W&C-Sent fills a gap in NLP resources for analyzing warmth and competence in language, supporting future research at the intersection of NLP and computational social science by providing sentence-level annotations of these fundamental social evaluation dimensions.

Abstract: Warmth (W) (often further broken down into Trust (T) and Sociability (S)) and Competence (C) are central dimensions along which people evaluate individuals and social groups (Fiske, 2018). While these constructs are well established in social psychology, they are only starting to get attention in NLP research through word-level lexicons, which do not completely capture their contextual expression in larger text units and discourse. In this work, we introduce Warmth and Competence Sentences (W&C-Sent), the first sentence-level dataset annotated for warmth and competence. The dataset includes over 1,600 English sentence--target pairs annotated along three dimensions: trust and sociability (components of warmth), and competence. The sentences in W&C-Sent are from social media and often express attitudes and opinions about specific individuals or social groups (the targets of our annotations). We describe the data collection, annotation, and quality-control procedures in detail, and evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) on their ability to identify trust, sociability, and competence in text. W&C-Sent provides a new resource for analyzing warmth and competence in language and supports future research at the intersection of NLP and computational social science.

### [15] [On the Fallacy of Global Token Perplexity in Spoken Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06329)
*Jeff Chan-Jan Sju,Liang-Hsuan Tseng,Yi-Cheng Lin,Yen-Chun Kuo,Ju-Chieh Chou,Kai-Wei Chang,Hung-yi Lee,Carlos Busso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes new evaluation methods for generative spoken language models that better capture speech characteristics than traditional global token perplexity, showing stronger correlation with human ratings and revealing reduced performance gaps between models and human baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of generative spoken language models uses "global token perplexity" which directly applies text evaluation methods to speech, overlooking fundamental differences between speech and text modalities and potentially underestimating speech characteristics.

Method: Proposes a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods as alternatives to naive global token perplexity for assessing spoken language models.

Result: The proposed evaluations show stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS) and reveal a significantly reduced performance gap between the best model and human topline when using appropriate metrics.

Conclusion: Appropriate evaluation is critical for accurately assessing progress in spoken language modeling, as traditional text-based metrics fail to capture speech-specific characteristics and may misrepresent model performance.

Abstract: Generative spoken language models pretrained on large-scale raw audio can continue a speech prompt with appropriate content while preserving attributes like speaker and emotion, serving as foundation models for spoken dialogue. In prior literature, these models are often evaluated using ``global token perplexity'', which directly applies the text perplexity formulation to speech tokens. However, this practice overlooks fundamental differences between speech and text modalities, possibly leading to an underestimation of the speech characteristics. In this work, we propose a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods that serve in place of naive global token perplexity. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluations more faithfully reflect perceived generation quality, as evidenced by stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS). When assessed under the new metrics, the relative performance landscape of spoken language models is reshaped, revealing a significantly reduced gap between the best-performing model and the human topline. Together, these results suggest that appropriate evaluation is critical for accurately assessing progress in spoken language modeling.

### [16] [What Matters When Building Universal Multilingual Named Entity Recognition Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06347)
*Jonas Golde,Patrick Haller,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Otter is a universal multilingual NER model supporting 100+ languages that achieves 5.3pp F1 improvement over GLiNER-x-base and competitive performance with large generative models while being more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work in universal multilingual NER lacks systematic justification for design decisions, with architectural components, training objectives, and data sources evaluated only in combination rather than isolation, making it difficult to identify which choices actually improve performance.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments on architectures, transformer backbones, training objectives, and data composition across many languages. Based on insights, developed Otter model with systematic design choices.

Result: Otter achieves consistent improvements over strong multilingual NER baselines, outperforming GLiNER-x-base by 5.3 percentage points in F1, and achieves competitive performance compared to large generative models like Qwen3-32B while being substantially more efficient.

Conclusion: Systematic evaluation of design decisions leads to better universal multilingual NER models. Otter demonstrates strong performance across 100+ languages while being efficient. The authors release model checkpoints, training, and evaluation code to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Recent progress in universal multilingual named entity recognition (NER) has been driven by advances in multilingual transformer models and task-specific architectures, loss functions, and training datasets. Despite substantial prior work, we find that many critical design decisions for such models are made without systematic justification, with architectural components, training objectives, and data sources evaluated only in combination rather than in isolation. We argue that these decisions impede progress in the field by making it difficult to identify which choices improve model performance. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments around architectures, transformer backbones, training objectives, and data composition across a wide range of languages. Based on these insights, we introduce Otter, a universal multilingual NER model supporting over 100 languages. Otter achieves consistent improvements over strong multilingual NER baselines, outperforming GLiNER-x-base by 5.3pp in F1 and achieves competitive performance compared to large generative models such as Qwen3-32B, while being substantially more efficient. We release model checkpoints, training and evaluation code to facilitate reproducibility and future research.

*Jakub Dec,Michał Dolina,Stanisław Drożdż,Jarosław Kwapień,Jin Liu,Tomasz Stanisz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analyzing word-adjacency networks in Chinese and English literature with punctuation treated as words reveals similar asymptotic behavior when punctuation is included, but Chinese shows larger path lengths when punctuation is excluded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how punctuation marks function similarly to words in network analysis and to explore topological differences between Chinese and English literary networks across different historical periods.

Method: Constructed growing word-adjacency networks from Chinese and English literary works across different epochs, treating punctuation marks as ordinary words. Analyzed functional dependence of average shortest path length L(N) on network size N for different periods, individual novels, and translations between languages.

Result: Empirical results were successfully approximated with a growing network model. L(N) behaves asymptotically similar for both languages when punctuation marks are included, but becomes significantly larger for Chinese when punctuation marks are neglected.

Conclusion: Punctuation marks carry genuine linguistic information and should be treated as words in network analysis of literary texts, as they reveal important topological similarities between languages that would otherwise be obscured.

Abstract: Complex networks provide powerful tools for analyzing and understanding the intricate structures present in various systems, including natural language. Here, we analyze topology of growing word-adjacency networks constructed from Chinese and English literary works written in different periods. Unconventionally, instead of considering dictionary words only, we also include punctuation marks as if they were ordinary words. Our approach is based on two arguments: (1) punctuation carries genuine information related to emotional state, allows for logical grouping of content, provides a pause in reading, and facilitates understanding by avoiding ambiguity, and (2) our previous works have shown that punctuation marks behave like words in a Zipfian analysis and, if considered together with regular words, can improve authorship attribution in stylometric studies. We focus on a functional dependence of the average shortest path length $L(N)$ on a network size $N$ for different epochs and individual novels in their original language as well as for translations of selected novels into the other language. We approximate the empirical results with a growing network model and obtain satisfactory agreement between the two. We also observe that $L(N)$ behaves asymptotically similar for both languages if punctuation marks are included but becomes sizably larger for Chinese if punctuation marks are neglected.

*Martha Larson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Folktales provide inspiration for using speech and language in technology without anthropomorphization, showing that extraordinary objects can communicate intelligently without being human-like.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech and language interfaces often rely on anthropomorphization, which has recently faced criticism. The paper seeks alternative approaches by looking at how folktales handle communication with non-human entities.

Method: The paper analyzes examples from folktales where extraordinary objects communicate through language, examining how these narratives decouple language capacity from humanness and anthropomorphization.

Result: Folktales demonstrate diverse and memorable examples of extraordinary objects with language capacity, showing that intelligence and communication don't require human-like characteristics, offering valuable analogies for technology design.

Conclusion: Folktales provide valuable inspiration for designing speech and language interfaces that avoid problematic anthropomorphization, suggesting alternative paradigms where objects can communicate intelligently without being human-like.

Abstract: Speech and language are valuable for interacting with technology. It would be ideal to be able to decouple their use from anthropomorphization, which has recently met an important moment of reckoning. In the world of folktales, language is everywhere and talking to extraordinary objects is not unusual. This overview presents examples of the analogies that folktales offer. Extraordinary objects in folktales are diverse and also memorable. Language capacity and intelligence are not always connected to humanness. Consideration of folktales can offer inspiration and insight for using speech and language for interacting with technology.

*Hao Yu,Tianyi Xu,Michael A. Hedderich,Wassim Hamidouche,Syed Waqas Zamir,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AfriqueLLM is a suite of open LLMs adapted to 20 African languages through continued pre-training on 26B tokens, showing that data composition (math, code, synthetic translations) drives performance gains more than model scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open LLMs underperform proprietary systems, especially for African languages. Continued pre-training offers adaptation but often fails on demanding capabilities like mathematical reasoning due to uneven domain coverage and missing task-relevant knowledge in low-resource language corpora.

Method: Created AfriqueLLM by performing continued pre-training on 26B tokens across 20 African languages. Tested five base models (Llama 3.1, Gemma 3, Qwen 3) with varying data mixtures including math, code, and synthetic translated data. Systematically analyzed how CPT data composition shapes downstream performance.

Result: Data composition is the primary driver of CPT gains. Adding math, code, and synthetic translated data yields consistent improvements, including on reasoning tasks. Larger models improve performance within fixed architectures, but architectural choices dominate scale across families. Strong multilingual base models don't reliably predict post-CPT outcomes.

Conclusion: Robust architectures coupled with task-aligned data provide a more dependable recipe for improving LLMs for African languages. Best models improve long-context performance including document-level translation. Models released on Huggingface.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly multilingual, yet open models continue to underperform relative to proprietary systems, with the gap most pronounced for African languages. Continued pre-training (CPT) offers a practical route to language adaptation, but improvements on demanding capabilities such as mathematical reasoning often remain limited. This limitation is driven in part by the uneven domain coverage and missing task-relevant knowledge that characterize many low-resource language corpora. We present \texttt{AfriqueLLM}, a suite of open LLMs adapted to 20 African languages through CPT on 26B tokens. We perform a comprehensive empirical study across five base models spanning sizes and architectures, including Llama 3.1, Gemma 3, and Qwen 3, and systematically analyze how CPT data composition shapes downstream performance. In particular, we vary mixtures that include math, code, and synthetic translated data, and evaluate the resulting models on a range of multilingual benchmarks. Our results identify data composition as the primary driver of CPT gains. Adding math, code, and synthetic translated data yields consistent improvements, including on reasoning-oriented evaluations. Within a fixed architecture, larger models typically improve performance, but architectural choices dominate scale when comparing across model families. Moreover, strong multilingual performance in the base model does not reliably predict post-CPT outcomes; robust architectures coupled with task-aligned data provide a more dependable recipe. Finally, our best models improve long-context performance, including document-level translation. Models have been released on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/collections/McGill-NLP/afriquellm).

*Sebastian Nehrdich,Kurt Keutzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MITRA framework enables large-scale mining of multilingual parallels in Buddhist texts, creating a 1.74M parallel corpus and domain-specific language models that achieve SOTA performance for translation and semantic embedding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ancient Buddhist literature contains extensive unannotated textual parallels across Sanskrit, Pāli, Chinese, and Tibetan that are too large to examine manually, creating a need for automated parallel passage mining tools.

Method: Developed MITRA-parallel pipeline for multilingual parallel passage mining, created a 1.74M parallel sentence corpus, and built Gemma 2 MITRA domain-specific pretrained language model with fine-tuned versions for machine translation (MITRA-MT) and semantic embedding (MITRA-E).

Result: Gemma 2 MITRA-MT achieves state-of-the-art machine translation performance for Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan to English, outperforming larger open-source models. MITRA-E shows SOTA performance on novel semantic embedding benchmark.

Conclusion: The MITRA framework provides valuable resources for both NLP research and philological studies of Buddhist literature through open access to parallel datasets, model weights, and semantic similarity benchmarks.

Abstract: Ancient Buddhist literature features frequent, yet often unannotated, textual parallels spread across diverse languages: Sanskrit, Pāli, Buddhist Chinese, Tibetan, and more. The scale of this material makes manual examination prohibitive. We present the MITRA framework, which consists of a novel pipeline for multilingual parallel passage mining, MITRA-parallel, a large-scale corpus of 1.74 million parallel sentence pairs between Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan, and the development of the domain-specific pretrained language model Gemma 2 MITRA. We present Gemma 2 MITRA-MT, a version of this base model fine-tuned on machine translation tasks, reaching state-of-the-art performance for machine translation of these languages into English and outperforming even much larger open-source models. We also present Gemma 2 MITRA-E, a semantic embedding model that shows state-of-the-art performance on a novel, detailed semantic embedding benchmark. We make the parallel dataset, model weights, and semantic similarity benchmark openly available to aid both NLP research and philological studies in Buddhist and classical Asian literature.

*Yijiang River Dong,Tiancheng Hu,Zheng Hui,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method called "system prompt strength" that treats prompt adherence as continuous control, enabling dynamic modulation of LLM behavior without retraining by contrasting logits from target and default system prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle to deviate from their helpful assistant persona due to strong post-training priors that resist conflicting instructions, limiting their ability to follow diverse system prompts effectively.

Method: System prompt strength contrasts logits from target and default system prompts to isolate and amplify the behavioral signal unique to the target persona by a scalar factor alpha, providing continuous control over prompt adherence.

Result: Substantial improvements across five benchmarks: +8.5 strict accuracy on IFEval, +45 percentage points refusal rate on OffTopicEval, and +13% steerability on Prompt-Steering, demonstrating effective behavioral control.

Conclusion: The approach enables practitioners to dynamically modulate system prompt strength, providing flexible control over model behavior without requiring retraining, addressing the limitation of rigid persona adherence in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at complex instructions yet struggle to deviate from their helpful assistant persona, as post-training instills strong priors that resist conflicting instructions. We introduce system prompt strength, a training-free method that treats prompt adherence as a continuous control. By contrasting logits from target and default system prompts, we isolate and amplify the behavioral signal unique to the target persona by a scalar factor alpha. Across five diverse benchmarks spanning constraint satisfaction, behavioral control, pluralistic alignment, capability modulation, and stylistic control, our method yields substantial improvements: up to +8.5 strict accuracy on IFEval, +45pp refusal rate on OffTopicEval, and +13% steerability on Prompt-Steering. Our approach enables practitioners to modulate system prompt strength, providing dynamic control over model behavior without retraining.

*Yijiang River Dong,Tiancheng Hu,Zheng Hui,Caiqi Zhang,Ivan Vulić,Andreea Bobu,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM agents use Value of Information framework to decide when to ask users for clarification vs. acting on incomplete info, balancing utility gain against cognitive cost without task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face a dilemma: user requests are often underspecified, forcing agents to choose between acting on incomplete information (risking mistakes) or interrupting users for clarification (imposing cognitive cost). Existing approaches either use brittle confidence thresholds requiring task-specific tuning, or fail to account for varying stakes of different decisions.

Method: Introduces a decision-theoretic framework using Value of Information (VoI) that enables agents to dynamically weigh expected utility gain from asking questions against the cognitive cost imposed on users. This inference-time method requires no hyperparameter tuning and adapts across contexts.

Result: Experiments across four diverse domains (20 Questions, medical diagnosis, flight booking, and e-commerce) show VoI consistently matches or exceeds best manually-tuned baselines, achieving up to 1.36 utility points higher in high-cost settings.

Conclusion: Provides a parameter-free framework for adaptive agent communication that explicitly balances task risk, query ambiguity, and user effort, enabling agents to make optimal decisions about when to seek clarification.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed for real-world tasks face a fundamental dilemma: user requests are underspecified, yet agents must decide whether to act on incomplete information or interrupt users for clarification. Existing approaches either rely on brittle confidence thresholds that require task-specific tuning, or fail to account for the varying stakes of different decisions. We introduce a decision-theoretic framework that resolves this trade-off through the Value of Information (VoI), enabling agents to dynamically weigh the expected utility gain from asking questions against the cognitive cost imposed on users. Our inference-time method requires no hyperparameter tuning and adapts seamlessly across contexts-from casual games to medical diagnosis. Experiments across four diverse domains (20 Questions, medical diagnosis, flight booking, and e-commerce) show that VoI consistently matches or exceeds the best manually-tuned baselines, achieving up to 1.36 utility points higher in high-cost settings. This work provides a parameter-free framework for adaptive agent communication that explicitly balances task risk, query ambiguity, and user effort.

*Zhengxuan Lu,Dongfang Li,Yukun Shi,Beilun Wang,Longyue Wang,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEEM is a hierarchical memory framework for LLMs that combines graph memory for relational facts with episodic memory for narrative progression, improving coherence in long-term agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG-based memory approaches in LLMs are static, scattered, and fail to capture structural dependencies needed for complex reasoning. Autonomous agents need better cognitive organization to model dynamic, associative long-term interactions.

Method: Proposes Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM) with two layers: graph memory for relational facts and dynamic episodic memory for narrative progression. Uses Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) with provenance pointers, plus associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanisms.

Result: SEEM significantly outperforms baselines on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency.

Conclusion: SEEM provides a cognitive-inspired hierarchical memory framework that addresses limitations of current RAG approaches, improving autonomous agents' ability to handle complex, long-term interactions through structured memory organization.

Abstract: Current approaches to memory in Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly rely on static Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which often results in scattered retrieval and fails to capture the structural dependencies required for complex reasoning. For autonomous agents, these passive and flat architectures lack the cognitive organization necessary to model the dynamic and associative nature of long-term interaction. To address this, we propose Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM), a hierarchical framework that synergizes a graph memory layer for relational facts with a dynamic episodic memory layer for narrative progression. Grounded in cognitive frame theory, SEEM transforms interaction streams into structured Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) anchored by precise provenance pointers. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanism to reconstruct coherent narrative contexts from fragmented evidence. Experimental results on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SEEM significantly outperforms baselines, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency.

TL;DR: LLMs can provide effective feedback to optimize vision-language models, improving multimodal scene descriptions by up to 13% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalable ways to add multimodal capabilities to existing LLMs by testing whether unimodal LLMs can reason about their informational needs and provide effective feedback to optimize multimodal models.

Method: Proposed method enables a language agent to give feedback to a vision-language model (VLM) to adapt text generation to the agent's preferences, using LLM preference feedback to enhance VLM descriptions.

Result: LLM preference feedback significantly enhances VLM descriptions, with up to 13% absolute accuracy improvement over baseline multimodal approach. Human study shows 64.6% preference alignment between LLM choices and human judgments.

Conclusion: Unimodal LLMs can effectively reason about their informational needs and provide valuable feedback to optimize multimodal models, offering a scalable path for adding multimodal capabilities to existing LLMs.

Abstract: To explore a more scalable path for adding multimodal capabilities to existing LLMs, this paper addresses a fundamental question: Can a unimodal LLM, relying solely on text, reason about its own informational needs and provide effective feedback to optimize a multimodal model? To answer this, we propose a method that enables a language agent to give feedback to a vision-language model (VLM) to adapt text generation to the agent's preferences. Our results from different experiments affirm this hypothesis, showing that LLM preference feedback significantly enhances VLM descriptions. Using our proposed method, we find that the VLM can generate multimodal scene descriptions to help the LLM better understand multimodal context, leading to improvements of maximum 13% in absolute accuracy compared to the baseline multimodal approach. Furthermore, a human study validated our AI-driven feedback, showing a 64.6% preference alignment rate between the LLM's choices and human judgments. Extensive experiments provide insights on how and why the method works and its limitations.

*Robert J. Moore,Sungeun An,Farhan Ahmed,Jay Pankaj Gala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NC-Bench introduces a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' conversational competence based on conversation structure/form rather than content, using IBM's Natural Conversation Framework to test sequence management patterns across basic, RAG, and complex request scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus too much on content and task-specific performance, neglecting the fundamental conversational structure and sequence management that characterizes natural human conversation. There's a need for a theory-grounded framework to assess general conversational competence beyond topical benchmarks.

Method: Based on IBM Natural Conversation Framework (NCF), NC-Bench has three sets: 1) Basic Conversation Competence (fundamental sequence management like answering, repairing, closing), 2) RAG set (same patterns with retrieval-augmented generation), 3) Complex Request set (more intricate sequence management patterns). Evaluates 14 interaction patterns across 6 open-source models.

Result: Models perform well on basic answering tasks, struggle with repair tasks (especially repeat), have mixed performance on closing sequences, and find complex multi-turn requests most challenging. Qwen models excel on Basic set, Granite models perform best on RAG and Complex Request sets.

Conclusion: NC-Bench provides a lightweight, extensible, theory-grounded framework for assessing LLMs' conversational abilities beyond topical benchmarks, operationalizing fundamental principles of human conversation to evaluate and improve conversational competence.

Abstract: The Natural Conversation Benchmark (NC-Bench) introduce a new approach to evaluating the general conversational competence of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on the content of model behavior, NC-Bench focuses on the form and structure of natural conversation. Grounded in the IBM Natural Conversation Framework (NCF), NC-Bench comprises three distinct sets. The Basic Conversation Competence set evaluates fundamental sequence management practices, such as answering inquiries, repairing responses, and closing conversational pairs. The RAG set applies the same sequence management patterns as the first set but incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The Complex Request set extends the evaluation to complex requests involving more intricate sequence management patterns. Each benchmark tests a model's ability to produce contextually appropriate conversational actions in response to characteristic interaction patterns. Initial evaluations across 6 open-source models and 14 interaction patterns show that models perform well on basic answering tasks, struggle more with repair tasks (especially repeat), have mixed performance on closing sequences, and find complex multi-turn requests most challenging, with Qwen models excelling on the Basic set and Granite models on the RAG set and the Complex Request set. By operationalizing fundamental principles of human conversation, NC-Bench provides a lightweight, extensible, and theory-grounded framework for assessing and improving the conversational abilities of LLMs beyond topical or task-specific benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTE framework reveals LLMs encode time as continuous manifolds, enabling controlled temporal navigation and showing universal geometric patterns across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs encode chronological progression is crucial for temporal reasoning, but current mechanisms remain opaque. The paper aims to bridge historical linguistics with mechanistic interpretability.

Method: Introduces Time Travel Engine (TTE) - an interpretability framework that projects diachronic linguistic patterns onto a shared chronological manifold, directly modulating latent representations to induce era-specific shifts while restricting future knowledge access.

Result: Temporal information is organized as continuous, traversable geometry rather than discrete clusters. Experiments show topological isomorphism between Chinese and English temporal subspaces, indicating universal geometric logic of historical evolution.

Conclusion: TTE bridges historical linguistics with mechanistic interpretability, offering a novel paradigm for controlling temporal reasoning in neural networks through continuous manifold navigation.

Abstract: Time functions as a fundamental dimension of human cognition, yet the mechanisms by which Large Language Models (LLMs) encode chronological progression remain opaque. We demonstrate that temporal information in their latent space is organized not as discrete clusters but as a continuous, traversable geometry. We introduce the Time Travel Engine (TTE), an interpretability-driven framework that projects diachronic linguistic patterns onto a shared chronological manifold. Unlike surface-level prompting, TTE directly modulates latent representations to induce coherent stylistic, lexical, and conceptual shifts aligned with target eras. By parameterizing diachronic evolution as a continuous manifold within the residual stream, TTE enables fluid navigation through period-specific "zeitgeists" while restricting access to future knowledge. Furthermore, experiments across diverse architectures reveal topological isomorphism between the temporal subspaces of Chinese and English-indicating that distinct languages share a universal geometric logic of historical evolution. These findings bridge historical linguistics with mechanistic interpretability, offering a novel paradigm for controlling temporal reasoning in neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs generate stories focusing on causal coherence but neglect complex story arcs and orchestration inherent in human narratives, creating structural misalignment between model- and human-generated narratives.

Method: Propose VISTA Space - a high-dimensional representational framework for narrative orchestration that unifies human and model narrative perspectives, and introduce LitVISTA - a structurally annotated benchmark grounded in literary texts for systematic evaluation.

Result: Oracle evaluations on frontier LLMs (GPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini) reveal systematic deficiencies: models fail to construct unified global narrative view and struggle to jointly capture narrative function and structure; advanced thinking modes yield only limited gains.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations in narrative orchestration capabilities, highlighting the need for frameworks like VISTA Space and benchmarks like LitVISTA to bridge the gap between computational and human narrative understanding.

Abstract: Computational narrative analysis aims to capture rhythm, tension, and emotional dynamics in literary texts. Existing large language models can generate long stories but overly focus on causal coherence, neglecting the complex story arcs and orchestration inherent in human narratives. This creates a structural misalignment between model- and human-generated narratives. We propose VISTA Space, a high-dimensional representational framework for narrative orchestration that unifies human and model narrative perspectives. We further introduce LitVISTA, a structurally annotated benchmark grounded in literary texts, enabling systematic evaluation of models' narrative orchestration capabilities. We conduct oracle evaluations on a diverse selection of frontier LLMs, including GPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini. Results reveal systematic deficiencies: existing models fail to construct a unified global narrative view, struggling to jointly capture narrative function and structure. Furthermore, even advanced thinking modes yield only limited gains for such literary narrative understanding.

TL;DR: PRISP is a lightweight, privacy-safe LLM personalization framework that uses a Text-to-LoRA hypernetwork to generate task-aware parameters and enables efficient few-shot adaptation under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM personalization methods require abundant data and resources while posing privacy risks, but realistic deployment needs personalization with limited user data, constrained computation, and strict privacy requirements.

Method: PRISP uses a Text-to-LoRA hypernetwork to generate task-aware LoRA parameters from task descriptions, then optimizes only a small subset of these parameters plus minimal additional modules using few-shot user data.

Result: Experiments on a few-shot variant of the LaMP benchmark show PRISP achieves strong overall performance compared to prior approaches while reducing computational overhead and eliminating privacy risks.

Conclusion: PRISP provides an effective solution for lightweight, privacy-safe LLM personalization under realistic deployment constraints of limited data, resources, and strict privacy requirements.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to adapt general-purpose models to individual users. Most existing methods, however, are developed under data-rich and resource-abundant settings, often incurring privacy risks. In contrast, realistic personalization typically occurs after deployment under (i) extremely limited user data, (ii) constrained computational resources, and (iii) strict privacy requirements. We propose PRISP, a lightweight and privacy-safe personalization framework tailored to these constraints. PRISP leverages a Text-to-LoRA hypernetwork to generate task-aware LoRA parameters from task descriptions, and enables efficient user personalization by optimizing a small subset of task-aware LoRA parameters together with minimal additional modules using few-shot user data. Experiments on a few-shot variant of the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that PRISP achieves strong overall performance compared to prior approaches, while reducing computational overhead and eliminating privacy risks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces IndRegBias, a dataset of 25,000 social media comments reflecting regional biases in India, and evaluates LLMs/ILMs for detecting these biases and their severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regional biases have received less attention than other social biases in NLP research due to difficulties in dataset extraction, annotation disagreements, and under-representation in existing studies.

Method: Created IndRegBias dataset from Reddit and YouTube comments on Indian regional topics, used multilevel annotation strategy for bias severity, and evaluated LLMs/ILMs with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Zero-shot and few-shot approaches showed lower accuracy in detecting regional biases and severity, while fine-tuning significantly improved LLM performance for Indian regional bias detection.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is effective for detecting regional biases in Indian contexts, and the IndRegBias dataset addresses a gap in regional bias research that has been overshadowed by other social bias studies.

Abstract: Warning: This paper consists of examples representing regional biases in Indian regions that might be offensive towards a particular region. While social biases corresponding to gender, race, socio-economic conditions, etc., have been extensively studied in the major applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), biases corresponding to regions have garnered less attention. This is mainly because of (i) difficulty in the extraction of regional bias datasets, (ii) disagreements in annotation due to inherent human biases, and (iii) regional biases being studied in combination with other types of social biases and often being under-represented. This paper focuses on creating a dataset IndRegBias, consisting of regional biases in an Indian context reflected in users' comments on popular social media platforms, namely Reddit and YouTube. We carefully selected 25,000 comments appearing on various threads in Reddit and videos on YouTube discussing trending topics on regional issues in India. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel annotation strategy to annotate the comments describing the severity of regional biased statements. To detect the presence of regional bias and its severity in IndRegBias, we evaluate open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Indic Language Models (ILMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning strategies. We observe that zero-shot and few-shot approaches show lower accuracy in detecting regional biases and severity in the majority of the LLMs and ILMs. However, the fine-tuning approach significantly enhances the performance of the LLM in detecting Indian regional bias along with its severity.

### [30] [Spec-o3: A Tool-Augmented Vision-Language Agent for Rare Celestial Object Candidate Vetting via Automated Spectral Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06498)
*Minghui Jia,Qichao Zhang,Ali Luo,Linjing Li,Shuo Ye,Hailing Lu,Wen Hou,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spec-o3 is a tool-augmented vision-language agent that automates astronomer-like spectral inspection using multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on rare-object identification while providing interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning classifiers lack generalization and interpretability, forcing astronomers to rely on time-consuming visual inspection of celestial object spectra. This manual process cannot scale with the data volume from modern spectroscopic surveys, creating a major bottleneck in astronomical catalog construction.

Method: Spec-o3 uses a tool-augmented vision-language agent with interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning. It's trained with a two-stage approach: 1) cold-start supervised fine-tuning on expert inspection trajectories, followed by 2) outcome-based reinforcement learning on rare-type verification tasks.

Result: On five rare-object identification tasks from LAMOST, Spec-o3 achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting macro-F1 score from 28.3 to 76.5 with a 7B parameter model. It outperforms both proprietary VLMs and specialized deep models, shows strong generalization to unseen tasks across surveys (LAMOST to SDSS/DESI), and produces coherent, physically consistent reasoning traces validated by experts.

Conclusion: Spec-o3 successfully bridges the gap between automated classification and expert visual inspection by providing an astronomer-aligned, interpretable system that scales with modern survey data while maintaining transparency and trustworthiness in decision-making.

Abstract: Due to the limited generalization and interpretability of deep learning classifiers, The final vetting of rare celestial object candidates still relies on expert visual inspection--a manually intensive process. In this process, astronomers leverage specialized tools to analyze spectra and construct reliable catalogs. However, this practice has become the primary bottleneck, as it is fundamentally incapable of scaling with the data deluge from modern spectroscopic surveys. To bridge this gap, we propose Spec-o3, a tool-augmented vision-language agent that performs astronomer-aligned spectral inspection via interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning. Spec-o3 is trained with a two-stage post-training recipe: cold-start supervised fine-tuning on expert inspection trajectories followed by outcome-based reinforcement learning on rare-type verification tasks. Evaluated on five rare-object identification tasks from LAMOST, Spec-o3 establishes a new State-of-the-Art, boosting the macro-F1 score from 28.3 to 76.5 with a 7B parameter base model and outperforming both proprietary VLMs and specialized deep models. Crucially, the agent demonstrates strong generalization to unseen inspection tasks across survey shifts (from LAMOST to SDSS/DESI). Expert evaluations confirm that its reasoning traces are coherent and physically consistent, supporting transparent and trustworthy decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical RAG systems often produce long-form outputs containing isolated unsupported or contradictory claims with serious safety implications, necessitating better verification methods.

Method: Decomposes answers into atomic claims, estimates claim support by combining evidence-grounded natural language inference with biomedical knowledge-graph consistency signals, uses ensemble verifier with class-specific reliability weighting, and distills pipeline into compact biomedical models.

Result: Experiments on four biomedical QA benchmarks show reliable flagging of unsupported/contradicted claims, revealing distinct risk profiles across generators, particularly on safety-critical biomedical relations.

Conclusion: MedRAGChecker provides effective claim-level verification for biomedical RAG, enabling better diagnosis of retrieval and generation failures and improving safety in medical applications.

Abstract: Biomedical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can ground LLM answers in medical literature, yet long-form outputs often contain isolated unsupported or contradictory claims with safety implications.
  We introduce MedRAGChecker, a claim-level verification and diagnostic framework for biomedical RAG.
  Given a question, retrieved evidence, and a generated answer, MedRAGChecker decomposes the answer into atomic claims and estimates claim support by combining evidence-grounded natural language inference (NLI) with biomedical knowledge-graph (KG) consistency signals.
  Aggregating claim decisions yields answer-level diagnostics that help disentangle retrieval and generation failures, including faithfulness, under-evidence, contradiction, and safety-critical error rates.
  To enable scalable evaluation, we distill the pipeline into compact biomedical models and use an ensemble verifier with class-specific reliability weighting.
  Experiments on four biomedical QA benchmarks show that MedRAGChecker reliably flags unsupported and contradicted claims and reveals distinct risk profiles across generators, particularly on safety-critical biomedical relations.

*Minghui Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Atomic-SNLI, a new dataset for atomic-level natural language inference that improves models' fine-grained reasoning while maintaining sentence-level performance and providing explainable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLI systems operate at sentence level with black-box decisions lacking explanatory power. Atomic-level NLI offers promise but conventional assumptions fail due to models' poor performance on fine-grained reasoning.

Method: Created Atomic-SNLI by decomposing SNLI dataset and enriching it with carefully curated atomic-level examples through linguistically informed generation strategies. Models are fine-tuned on this dataset.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Atomic-SNLI achieve significant improvements in atomic reasoning capabilities while maintaining strong sentence-level performance, enabling both accurate judgements and transparent, explainable results.

Conclusion: Atomic-SNLI addresses limitations of current NLI systems by improving fine-grained reasoning while providing explainable, fact-level transparency, bridging the gap between atomic and sentence-level inference.

Abstract: Current Natural Language Inference (NLI) systems primarily operate at the sentence level, providing black-box decisions that lack explanatory power. While atomic-level NLI offers a promising alternative by decomposing hypotheses into individual facts, we demonstrate that the conventional assumption that a hypothesis is entailed only when all its atomic facts are entailed fails in practice due to models' poor performance on fine-grained reasoning. Our analysis reveals that existing models perform substantially worse on atomic level inference compared to sentence level tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Atomic-SNLI, a novel dataset constructed by decomposing SNLI and enriching it with carefully curated atomic level examples through linguistically informed generation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on Atomic-SNLI achieve significant improvements in atomic reasoning capabilities while maintaining strong sentence level performance, enabling both accurate judgements and transparent, explainable results at the fact level.

*Dennis Zyska,Alla Rozovskaya,Ilia Kuznetsov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Exposía is the first public dataset connecting student writing and feedback assessment in higher education, enabling research on academic writing evaluation. It includes research proposals, peer/instructor feedback, and human assessment scores, used to benchmark LLMs for automated scoring tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for educationally grounded approaches to academic writing evaluation research. Current research lacks public datasets that connect student writing with feedback assessment in real higher education contexts, particularly for multi-stage academic writing processes involving drafting, feedback, and revision.

Method: Created Exposía dataset from Computer Science undergraduate "Introduction to Scientific Work" course, including student research proposals and peer/instructor feedback with comments and free-text reviews. Developed fine-grained pedagogically-grounded schema for writing and feedback assessment. Used dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art open-source LLMs for automated scoring of proposals and student reviews.

Result: Strongest LLMs achieve high agreement on scoring aspects requiring little domain knowledge but degrade on content evaluation dimensions, aligning with human agreement patterns. LLMs align better with human instructors giving high scores. Prompting strategy scoring multiple writing aspects together is most effective for classroom deployment.

Conclusion: Exposía enables research on educationally grounded academic writing evaluation. LLMs show promise for automated scoring but have limitations in content evaluation. Multi-aspect prompting strategies are most effective for practical classroom applications.

Abstract: We present Exposía, the first public dataset that connects writing and feedback assessment in higher education, enabling research on educationally grounded approaches to academic writing evaluation. Exposía includes student research project proposals and peer and instructor feedback consisting of comments and free-text reviews. The dataset was collected in the "Introduction to Scientific Work" course of the Computer Science undergraduate program that focuses on teaching academic writing skills and providing peer feedback on academic writing. Exposía reflects the multi-stage nature of the academic writing process that includes drafting, providing and receiving feedback, and revising the writing based on the feedback received. Both the project proposals and peer feedback are accompanied by human assessment scores based on a fine-grained, pedagogically-grounded schema for writing and feedback assessment that we develop.
  We use Exposía to benchmark state-of-the-art open-source large language models (LLMs) for two tasks: automated scoring of (1) the proposals and (2) the student reviews. The strongest LLMs attain high agreement on scoring aspects that require little domain knowledge but degrade on dimensions evaluating content, in line with human agreement values. We find that LLMs align better with the human instructors giving high scores. Finally, we establish that a prompting strategy that scores multiple aspects of the writing together is the most effective, an important finding for classroom deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning open-source LLMs (Qwen-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B) for SimPy queueing simulation code generation to address cost and privacy concerns of closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-source LLMs like GPT-4o for SimPy queueing simulation code generation have high computational costs and data privacy concerns, while open-source models need improvement for reliable code generation.

Method: Multi-stage fine-tuning framework: two stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and one stage of direct preference optimization (DPO) on curated SimPy queueing data to enhance executability, output-format compliance, and instruction-code consistency.

Result: Both fine-tuned models achieve substantial improvements in executability, output-format compliance, and instruction consistency, making them reliable SimPy simulation generators comparable to closed-source alternatives.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning can transform compact open-source code models into practical alternatives to closed-source LLMs for SimPy queueing simulation in education, research, and operational decision support.

Abstract: The Python package SimPy is widely used for modeling queueing systems due to its flexibility, simplicity, and smooth integration with modern data analysis and optimization frameworks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating clear and executable code, making them powerful and suitable tools for writing SimPy queueing simulation code. However, directly employing closed-source models like GPT-4o to generate such code may lead to high computational costs and raise data privacy concerns. To address this, we fine-tune two open-source LLMs, Qwen-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, on curated SimPy queueing data, which enhances their code-generating performance in executability, output-format compliance, and instruction-code consistency. Particularly, we proposed a multi-stage fine-tuning framework comprising two stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and one stage of direct preference optimization (DPO), progressively enhancing the model's ability in SimPy-based queueing simulation code generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that both fine-tuned models achieve substantial improvements in executability, output-format compliance, and instruct consistency. These results confirm that domain-specific fine-tuning can effectively transform compact open-source code models into reliable SimPy simulation generators which provide a practical alternative to closed-source LLMs for education, research, and operational decision support.

TL;DR: Proposes CSR-RAG, a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation system for enterprise-scale Text-to-SQL that combines contextual, structural, and relational retrieval to efficiently retrieve relevant tables before SQL generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While academic Text-to-SQL benchmarks include schema descriptions in natural language input, enterprise applications require table retrieval from large databases before SQL generation. There's a need for computationally efficient yet accurate retrieval for enterprise-scale systems.

Method: CSR-RAG (Contextual, Structural, and Relational Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - a hybrid RAG system that combines three types of retrieval: contextual (semantic understanding), structural (schema organization), and relational (table relationships) to efficiently identify relevant tables for SQL generation.

Result: Achieves up to 40% precision and over 80% recall on enterprise benchmarks with negligible average query generation latency of only 30ms on commodity data center hardware, making it suitable for modern LLM-based enterprise systems.

Conclusion: CSR-RAG provides an effective solution for enterprise-scale Text-to-SQL by enabling efficient table retrieval before SQL generation, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency for practical deployment in large-scale systems.

Abstract: Natural language to SQL translation (Text-to-SQL) is one of the long-standing problems that has recently benefited from advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While most academic Text-to-SQL benchmarks request schema description as a part of natural language input, enterprise-scale applications often require table retrieval before SQL query generation. To address this need, we propose a novel hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system consisting of contextual, structural, and relational retrieval (CSR-RAG) to achieve computationally efficient yet sufficiently accurate retrieval for enterprise-scale databases. Through extensive enterprise benchmarks, we demonstrate that CSR-RAG achieves up to 40% precision and over 80% recall while incurring a negligible average query generation latency of only 30ms on commodity data center hardware, which makes it appropriate for modern LLM-based enterprise-scale systems.

Motivation: Existing evaluations overlook execution accuracy and safety in on-chain transaction scenarios where minor errors can cause irreversible losses. There's a need for benchmarks that test LLMs' ability to generate correct transaction scripts for EVM-compatible blockchains.

Method: Dynamic evaluation using template pools for instructions, predefined intervals for numeric parameters, and validators to verify outcomes against instantiated values. Modular architecture enables rapid task development. Runner executes scripts on forked EVM chain with snapshot isolation, with composite tasks applying step-efficiency decay.

Result: Benchmark contains 107 tasks (62 atomic, 45 composite). Evaluation of 20 models reveals large performance gaps, with split scores showing persistent asymmetry between single-action precision and multi-step workflow completion.

Conclusion: EVM-QuestBench addresses critical gaps in LLM evaluation for blockchain transaction scenarios, highlighting significant performance disparities and the need for improved multi-step reasoning capabilities in transaction-script generation.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to various development scenarios. However, in on-chain transaction scenarios, even a minor error can cause irreversible loss for users. Existing evaluations often overlook execution accuracy and safety. We introduce EVM-QuestBench, an execution-grounded benchmark for natural-language transaction-script generation on EVM-compatible chains. The benchmark employs dynamic evaluation: instructions are sampled from template pools, numeric parameters are drawn from predefined intervals, and validators verify outcomes against these instantiated values. EVM-QuestBench contains 107 tasks (62 atomic, 45 composite). Its modular architecture enables rapid task development. The runner executes scripts on a forked EVM chain with snapshot isolation; composite tasks apply step-efficiency decay. We evaluate 20 models and find large performance gaps, with split scores revealing persistent asymmetry between single-action precision and multi-step workflow completion.

TL;DR: This paper explores using psychological circumplex models to structure emotion representations in language models via contrastive learning on a hypersphere, finding trade-offs between interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological circumplex models have long been used to structure emotions but are rarely directly incorporated into language model representation learning, leaving their geometric validity unexplored in deep learning contexts.

Method: Proposes inducing circular emotion representations within language model embeddings via contrastive learning on a hypersphere, creating a geometric structure where similar emotions are adjacent and opposing ones are diagonal.

Result: Circular alignment offers superior interpretability and robustness against dimensionality reduction, but underperforms compared to conventional designs in high-dimensional settings and fine-grained classification tasks.

Conclusion: The findings elucidate the trade-offs involved in applying psychological circumplex models to deep learning architectures, highlighting the tension between interpretability and performance in different contexts.

Abstract: Psychological research has long utilized circumplex models to structure emotions, placing similar emotions adjacently and opposing ones diagonally. Although frequently used to interpret deep learning representations, these models are rarely directly incorporated into the representation learning of language models, leaving their geometric validity unexplored. This paper proposes a method to induce circular emotion representations within language model embeddings via contrastive learning on a hypersphere. We show that while this circular alignment offers superior interpretability and robustness against dimensionality reduction, it underperforms compared to conventional designs in high-dimensional settings and fine-grained classification. Our findings elucidate the trade-offs involved in applying psychological circumplex models to deep learning architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Singlish evolution over a decade using digital text messages, finding significant diachronic changes in tone and structure, while showing LLMs struggle to produce temporally neutral Singlish despite appearing superficially realistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Singlish, a Singaporean creole, evolves over time in informal digital communication, and to examine whether current LLMs can accurately model both its sociolectal and temporal variations.

Method: Proposed a stylistic similarity framework comparing lexico-structural, pragmatic, psycholinguistic, and encoder-derived features across years of informal digital text messages to quantify temporal variation. Also tested LLMs' ability to generate temporally neutral Singlish through prompting and fine-tuning.

Result: Revealed notable diachronic changes in Singlish tone, expressivity, and sentence construction over the years. Found that while LLMs could generate superficially realistic Singlish messages, they failed to produce temporally neutral outputs, with residual temporal signals remaining detectable despite prompting and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Singlish demonstrates dynamic evolution in digital communication, and current LLMs have limitations in modeling both sociolectal and temporal variations of colloquial language, highlighting the complexity of capturing authentic language evolution.

Abstract: Singlish is a creole rooted in Singapore's multilingual environment and continues to evolve alongside social and technological change. This study investigates the evolution of Singlish over a decade of informal digital text messages. We propose a stylistic similarity framework that compares lexico-structural, pragmatic, psycholinguistic, and encoder-derived features across years to quantify temporal variation. Our analysis reveals notable diachronic changes in tone, expressivity and sentence construction over the years. Conversely, while some LLMs were able to generate superficially realistic Singlish messages, they do not produce temporally neutral outputs, and residual temporal signals remain detectable despite prompting and fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the dynamic evolution of Singlish, as well as the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs in modeling sociolectal and temporal variations in the colloquial language.

TL;DR: A novel LLM detector that identifies AI-generated text without needing watermarks or model information, offering statistical inference capabilities and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' ability to produce human-like text raises concerns about fake news, misleading reports, and academic misconduct, creating a need for reliable detection methods.

Method: Train a classifier to distinguish human vs. LLM text without auxiliary information (watermarks or specific LLM knowledge), enabling statistical inference and deployed on an online CPU-based platform.

Result: Achieves higher classification accuracy than existing detectors while maintaining type-I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed detector effectively addresses practical concerns about LLM-generated content by providing a robust, statistically sound, and efficient solution for text authorship identification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok have been deeply integrated into our daily life. They now support a wide range of tasks -- from dialogue and email drafting to assisting with teaching and coding, serving as search engines, and much more. However, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns, including the spread of fake news, the generation of misleading governmental reports, and academic misconduct. To address this practical problem, we train a classifier to determine whether a piece of text is authored by an LLM or a human. Our detector is deployed on an online CPU-based platform https://huggingface.co/spaces/stats-powered-ai/StatDetectLLM, and contains three novelties over existing detectors: (i) it does not rely on auxiliary information, such as watermarks or knowledge of the specific LLM used to generate the text; (ii) it more effectively distinguishes between human- and LLM-authored text; and (iii) it enables statistical inference, which is largely absent in the current literature. Empirically, our classifier achieves higher classification accuracy compared to existing detectors, while maintaining type-I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency.

*Shivam Adarsh,Maria Maistro,Christina Lioma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a geometric analysis of how context transforms truth vectors in LLMs' activation space, showing directional and magnitude changes across model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior work has studied truth vectors in LLMs, how these vectors change when context is introduced remains unexplored. The paper aims to understand the geometric transformation of truth vectors in the activation space when context is provided.

Method: The researchers measure two geometric properties: (1) the directional change (θ) between truth vectors with and without context, and (2) the relative magnitude of truth vectors upon adding context. They conduct experiments across four LLMs and four datasets to analyze these transformations.

Result: Key findings: (1) Truth vectors are orthogonal in early layers, converge in middle layers, and stabilize/increase in later layers; (2) Context generally increases truth vector magnitude, amplifying separation between true/false representations; (3) Larger models distinguish relevant from irrelevant context through directional changes, while smaller models use magnitude differences; (4) Context conflicting with parametric knowledge produces larger geometric changes than aligned context.

Conclusion: This is the first work providing a geometric characterization of how context transforms truth vectors in LLM activation space, revealing systematic patterns across model layers and sizes, with implications for understanding LLM reasoning and knowledge representation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often encode whether a statement is true as a vector in their residual stream activations. These vectors, also known as truth vectors, have been studied in prior work, however how they change when context is introduced remains unexplored. We study this question by measuring (1) the directional change ($θ$) between the truth vectors with and without context and (2) the relative magnitude of the truth vectors upon adding context. Across four LLMs and four datasets, we find that (1) truth vectors are roughly orthogonal in early layers, converge in middle layers, and may stabilize or continue increasing in later layers; (2) adding context generally increases the truth vector magnitude, i.e., the separation between true and false representations in the activation space is amplified; (3) larger models distinguish relevant from irrelevant context mainly through directional change ($θ$), while smaller models show this distinction through magnitude differences. We also find that context conflicting with parametric knowledge produces larger geometric changes than parametrically aligned context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a geometric characterization of how context transforms the truth vector in the activation space of LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-video platforms are major channels for misinformation, especially in health domains, and while MLLMs have strong reasoning capabilities, their robustness against misinformation combined with cognitive biases remains under-explored.

Method: Created a comprehensive evaluation framework using a manually annotated dataset of 200 short videos across four health domains, with fine-grained annotations for three deceptive patterns (experimental errors, logical fallacies, fabricated claims) verified by evidence. Evaluated eight frontier MLLMs across five modality settings.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieved the highest performance in multimodal setting with belief score 71.5/100, while o3 performed worst at 35.2. Models were found susceptible to social cues like authoritative channel IDs that induce false beliefs.

Conclusion: MLLMs show varying robustness against health misinformation in short videos, with significant vulnerability to deceptive patterns and social biases, highlighting the need for improved multimodal misinformation detection systems.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become major channels for misinformation, where deceptive claims frequently leverage visual experiments and social cues. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, their robustness against misinformation entangled with cognitive biases remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework using a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 200 short videos spanning four health domains. This dataset provides fine-grained annotations for three deceptive patterns, experimental errors, logical fallacies, and fabricated claims, each verified by evidence such as national standards and academic literature. We evaluate eight frontier MLLMs across five modality settings. Experimental results demonstrate that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest performance in the multimodal setting with a belief score of 71.5/100, while o3 performs the worst at 35.2. Furthermore, we investigate social cues that induce false beliefs in videos and find that models are susceptible to biases like authoritative channel IDs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: N2N-GQA is a zero-shot framework for multi-hop QA over hybrid table-text data that constructs dynamic evidence graphs from noisy retrieval outputs, achieving performance comparable to fine-tuned models without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG pipelines process documents as flat ranked lists, causing retrieval noise to obscure reasoning chains in multi-hop QA over hybrid table-text data. There's a need for better evidence organization to support multi-hop reasoning.

Method: N2N-GQA constructs dynamic evidence graphs from noisy retrieval outputs by modeling documents as graph nodes with semantic relationships as edges. This identifies bridge documents connecting reasoning steps, enabling better multi-hop reasoning.

Result: On OTT-QA, graph-based evidence curation provides 19.9-point EM improvement over strong baselines. N2N-GQA achieves 48.80 EM, matching fine-tuned retrieval models (CORE: 49.0 EM) and approaching heavily optimized systems (COS: 56.9 EM) without any task-specific training.

Conclusion: Graph-structured evidence organization is essential for scalable, zero-shot multi-hop QA systems. Simple, interpretable graph construction can rival sophisticated fine-tuned approaches, establishing a new paradigm for evidence organization in multi-hop reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering over hybrid table-text data requires retrieving and reasoning across multiple evidence pieces from large corpora, but standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines process documents as flat ranked lists, causing retrieval noise to obscure reasoning chains. We introduce N2N-GQA. To our knowledge, it is the first zeroshot framework for open-domain hybrid table-text QA that constructs dynamic evidence graphs from noisy retrieval outputs. Our key insight is that multi-hop reasoning requires understanding relationships between evidence pieces: by modeling documents as graph nodes with semantic relationships as edges, we identify bridge documents connecting reasoning steps, a capability absent in list-based retrieval. On OTT-QA, graph-based evidence curation provides a 19.9-point EM improvement over strong baselines, demonstrating that organizing retrieval results as structured graphs is critical for multihop reasoning. N2N-GQA achieves 48.80 EM, matching finetuned retrieval models (CORE: 49.0 EM) and approaching heavily optimized systems (COS: 56.9 EM) without any task specific training. This establishes graph-structured evidence organization as essential for scalable, zero-shot multi-hop QA systems and demonstrates that simple, interpretable graph construction can rival sophisticated fine-tuned approaches.

Method: Created dataset of 200 verses with thematic tags. Uses IndicBERT sentence embeddings for semantic retrieval of top-k verses, then passes results to Mistral LLM for transliteration, translation, and contextual explanations.

Result: Semantic retrieval significantly outperforms keyword matching in precision and relevance. User studies show improved accessibility through generated summaries.

Conclusion: First attempt at integrating retrieval and generation for Sanskrit Subhasitas, bridging cultural heritage with modern applied AI.

Abstract: Sanskrit Subhasitas encapsulate centuries of cultural and philosophical wisdom, yet remain underutilized in the digital age due to linguistic and contextual barriers. In this work, we present Pragya, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for semantic recommendation of Subhasitas. We curate a dataset of 200 verses annotated with thematic tags such as motivation, friendship, and compassion. Using sentence embeddings (IndicBERT), the system retrieves top-k verses relevant to user queries. The retrieved results are then passed to a generative model (Mistral LLM) to produce transliterations, translations, and contextual explanations. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that semantic retrieval significantly outperforms keyword matching in precision and relevance, while user studies highlight improved accessibility through generated summaries. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating retrieval and generation for Sanskrit Subhasitas, bridging cultural heritage with modern applied AI.

*Marco Martinelli,Stefano Marchesin,Gianmaria Silvello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A sampling framework to estimate Named Entity Linking accuracy in biomedical corpora with statistical guarantees, reducing annotation costs by 29% while maintaining precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing NEL quality at scale is challenging due to high expert annotation costs and large corpus sizes, requiring efficient methods to estimate accuracy with statistical guarantees.

Method: Frames NEL accuracy estimation as constrained optimization to minimize annotation cost while meeting target Margin of Error. Adapts Stratified Two-Stage Cluster Sampling (STWCS) with label-based strata and global surface-form clusters independent of NEL annotations.

Result: Applied to 11,184 NEL annotations in GutBrainIE corpus, achieved MoE ≤ 0.05 by annotating only 2,749 triples (24.6%), estimating overall accuracy at 0.915 ± 0.0473. Reduced expert annotation time by ~29% compared to Simple Random Sampling baseline.

Conclusion: The framework provides a generic, statistically robust method for scalable accuracy assessment of NEL systems and other IE pipelines, significantly reducing annotation costs while maintaining precision.

Abstract: Named Entity Linking (NEL) is a core component of biomedical Information Extraction (IE) pipelines, yet assessing its quality at scale is challenging due to the high cost of expert annotations and the large size of corpora. In this paper, we present a sampling-based framework to estimate the NEL accuracy of large-scale IE corpora under statistical guarantees and constrained annotation budgets. We frame NEL accuracy estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize expected annotation cost subject to a target Margin of Error (MoE) for the corpus-level accuracy estimate. Building on recent works on knowledge graph accuracy estimation, we adapt Stratified Two-Stage Cluster Sampling (STWCS) to the NEL setting, defining label-based strata and global surface-form clusters in a way that is independent of NEL annotations. Applied to 11,184 NEL annotations in GutBrainIE -- a new biomedical corpus openly released in fall 2025 -- our framework reaches a MoE $\leq 0.05$ by manually annotating only 2,749 triples (24.6%), leading to an overall accuracy estimate of $0.915 \pm 0.0473$. A time-based cost model and simulations against a Simple Random Sampling (SRS) baseline show that our design reduces expert annotation time by about 29% at fixed sample size. The framework is generic and can be applied to other NEL benchmarks and IE pipelines that require scalable and statistically robust accuracy assessment.

### [45] [Labels have Human Values: Value Calibration of Subjective Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06631)
*Mohammed Fayiz Parappan,Ricardo Henao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MC-STL framework clusters annotations by human values (using rationales, taxonomies, or sociocultural descriptors) and learns value-specific embeddings to improve performance on subjective NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP systems for subjective tasks need alignment with diverse human values, as different people may have contrasting perspectives on what constitutes appropriate or desirable outputs.

Method: Three approaches to cluster annotations by human values: 1) similarity of annotator rationales, 2) expert-value taxonomies, 3) rater's sociocultural descriptors. Then learns cluster-specific embeddings to calibrate predictions for each value cluster.

Result: MC-STL consistently outperforms baselines that ignore latent value structure across multiple datasets (toxic chatbot conversations, offensive social media posts, human preference alignment) and various subjective learning settings (ordinal, binary, preference learning).

Conclusion: The framework successfully captures and leverages the latent value structure in subjective annotations, delivering improvements in discrimination, value-specific calibration, and disagreement-aware metrics for subjective NLP tasks.

Abstract: Building NLP systems for subjective tasks requires one to ensure their alignment to contrasting human values. We propose the MultiCalibrated Subjective Task Learner framework (MC-STL), which clusters annotations into identifiable human value clusters by three approaches (similarity of annotator rationales, expert-value taxonomies or rater's sociocultural descriptors) and calibrates predictions for each value cluster by learning cluster-specific embeddings. We demonstrate MC-STL on several subjective learning settings, including ordinal, binary, and preference learning predictions, and evaluate it on multiple datasets covering toxic chatbot conversations, offensive social media posts, and human preference alignment. The results show that MC-STL consistently outperforms the baselines that ignore the latent value structure of the annotations, delivering gains in discrimination, value-specific calibration, and disagreement-aware metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedEinst benchmark reveals LLMs' Einstellung Effect in clinical diagnosis - relying on statistical shortcuts rather than patient evidence, causing misdiagnosis in atypical cases. ECR-Agent proposed to align LLM reasoning with Evidence-Based Medicine standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs achieve high accuracy on medical benchmarks but exhibit the Einstellung Effect - relying on statistical shortcuts rather than patient-specific evidence, causing misdiagnosis in atypical cases. Existing benchmarks fail to detect this critical failure mode.

Method: 1) Introduce MedEinst benchmark with 5,383 paired clinical cases across 49 diseases (control case + "trap" case with altered evidence that flips diagnosis). 2) Propose ECR-Agent with two components: Dynamic Causal Inference (DCI) for structured reasoning through dual-pathway perception, dynamic causal graph reasoning, and evidence audit; and Critic-Driven Graph and Memory Evolution (CGME) for iterative refinement via exemplar base and evolving illness graphs.

Result: Extensive evaluation of 17 LLMs shows frontier models achieve high baseline accuracy but severe bias trap rates (measured via Bias Trap Rate - probability of misdiagnosing traps despite correctly diagnosing controls).

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit dangerous diagnostic biases that existing benchmarks miss. ECR-Agent provides a promising approach to align LLM reasoning with Evidence-Based Medicine standards through structured causal reasoning and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Despite achieving high accuracy on medical benchmarks, LLMs exhibit the Einstellung Effect in clinical diagnosis--relying on statistical shortcuts rather than patient-specific evidence, causing misdiagnosis in atypical cases. Existing benchmarks fail to detect this critical failure mode. We introduce MedEinst, a counterfactual benchmark with 5,383 paired clinical cases across 49 diseases. Each pair contains a control case and a "trap" case with altered discriminative evidence that flips the diagnosis. We measure susceptibility via Bias Trap Rate--probability of misdiagnosing traps despite correctly diagnosing controls. Extensive Evaluation of 17 LLMs shows frontier models achieve high baseline accuracy but severe bias trap rates. Thus, we propose ECR-Agent, aligning LLM reasoning with Evidence-Based Medicine standard via two components: (1) Dynamic Causal Inference (DCI) performs structured reasoning through dual-pathway perception, dynamic causal graph reasoning across three levels (association, intervention, counterfactual), and evidence audit for final diagnosis; (2) Critic-Driven Graph and Memory Evolution (CGME) iteratively refines the system by storing validated reasoning paths in an exemplar base and consolidating disease-specific knowledge into evolving illness graphs. Source code is to be released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes SpikeATE, an energy-efficient Aspect Term Extraction method using Spiking Neural Networks that achieves comparable performance to DNNs with significantly lower energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing ATE approaches use energy-intensive deep neural networks. There's a need for more energy-efficient alternatives that can perform ATE tasks effectively while reducing computational costs.

Method: SpikeATE architecture uses Spiking Neural Networks with ternary spiking neurons and direct spike training fine-tuned with pseudo-gradients. SNNs leverage sparse activations and event-driven inferences to capture temporal dependencies between words.

Result: Evaluated on four benchmark SemEval datasets, SpikeATE achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art DNNs while consuming significantly lower energy.

Conclusion: SNNs represent a practical and sustainable choice for ATE tasks, offering energy efficiency without compromising performance compared to traditional DNN approaches.

Abstract: Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) identifies aspect terms in review sentences, a key subtask of sentiment analysis. While most existing approaches use energy-intensive deep neural networks (DNNs) for ATE as sequence labeling, this paper proposes a more energy-efficient alternative using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Using sparse activations and event-driven inferences, SNNs capture temporal dependencies between words, making them suitable for ATE. The proposed architecture, SpikeATE, employs ternary spiking neurons and direct spike training fine-tuned with pseudo-gradients. Evaluated on four benchmark SemEval datasets, SpikeATE achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art DNNs with significantly lower energy consumption. This highlights the use of SNNs as a practical and sustainable choice for ATE tasks.

### [48] [Do Language Models Reason Across Languages?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06644)
*Yan Meng,Wafaa Mohammed,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models struggle with faithful step-by-step reasoning in multilingual two-hop QA, often failing to properly decompose reasoning across languages, but a simple SUBQ prompting method dramatically improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world information is multilingual, raising questions about whether language models can effectively synthesize information across languages, particularly in multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Method: Introduces a two-hop multilingual QA setting requiring inference over two documents. Uses step-by-step sub-question evaluation to analyze reasoning patterns, and proposes a three-stage SUBQ prompting method to guide multi-step reasoning with explicit sub-questions.

Result: Found language models are more sensitive to language variation in answer-span documents than bridging documents. Models fail to infer bridging information in 33% of multilingual cases yet still answer correctly, indicating unfaithful reasoning. 18% composition failure occurs when sub-questions are answered correctly but final two-hop questions fail. SUBQ prompting boosts accuracy from 10.1% to 66.5%.

Conclusion: Language models lack faithful step-by-step reasoning decomposition in multilingual settings, leading to composition failures, but explicit sub-question prompting can significantly improve cross-lingual reasoning performance.

Abstract: The real-world information sources are inherently multilingual, which naturally raises a question about whether language models can synthesize information across languages. In this paper, we introduce a simple two-hop question answering setting, where answering a question requires making inferences over two multilingual documents. We find that language models are more sensitive to language variation in answer-span documents than in those providing bridging information, despite the equal importance of both documents for answering a question. Under a step-by-step sub-question evaluation, we further show that in up to 33% of multilingual cases, models fail to infer the bridging information in the first step yet still answer the overall question correctly. This indicates that reasoning in language models, especially in multilingual settings, does not follow a faithful step-by-step decomposition. Subsequently, we show that the absence of reasoning decomposition leads to around 18% composition failure, where both sub-questions are answered correctly but fail for the final two-hop questions. To mitigate this, we propose a simple three-stage SUBQ prompting method to guide the multi-step reasoning with sub-questions, which boosts accuracy from 10.1% to 66.5%.

### [49] [What makes for an enjoyable protagonist? An analysis of character warmth and competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06658)
*Hannes Rosenbusch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study finds small but theory-consistent associations between movie protagonists' warmth/competence and IMDb ratings, with male-led movies receiving higher ratings overall. AI annotation proved effective but imperfect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether psychological dimensions of character personality (warmth and competence) predict movie ratings, and whether these effects vary across genres, using large-scale computational methods.

Method: Analyzed 2,858 films/series from Movie Scripts Corpus; identified protagonists via AI-assisted annotation; quantified warmth/competence using LLM_annotate package (gpt-4.1-mini); conducted preregistered Bayesian regression analyses.

Result: Small but theory-consistent associations between warmth/competence and ratings; genre interactions not meaningful; male protagonists less warm than females; male-led movies received higher ratings (stronger effect than warmth/competence).

Conclusion: Character personality has modest effects on movie ratings, suggesting it's only one of many factors. AI annotation is effective for large-scale analysis but imperfect compared to manual methods.

Abstract: Drawing on psychological and literary theory, we investigated whether the warmth and competence of movie protagonists predict IMDb ratings, and whether these effects vary across genres. Using 2,858 films and series from the Movie Scripts Corpus, we identified protagonists via AI-assisted annotation and quantified their warmth and competence with the LLM_annotate package ([1]; human-LLM agreement: r = .83). Preregistered Bayesian regression analyses revealed theory-consistent but small associations between both warmth and competence and audience ratings, while genre-specific interactions did not meaningfully improve predictions. Male protagonists were slightly less warm than female protagonists, and movies with male leads received higher ratings on average (an association that was multiple times stronger than the relationships between movie ratings and warmth/competence). These findings suggest that, although audiences tend to favor warm, competent characters, the effects on movie evaluations are modest, indicating that character personality is only one of many factors shaping movie ratings. AI-assisted annotation with LLM_annotate and gpt-4.1-mini proved effective for large-scale analyses but occasionally fell short of manually generated annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InFi-Check is a framework for interpretable, fine-grained fact-checking of LLM outputs that goes beyond binary classification by providing evidence, error type classification, justifications, and corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fact-checking methods treat factuality evaluation as binary classification, offering limited interpretability and failing to capture fine-grained error types in LLM hallucinations.

Method: 1) Controlled data synthesis pipeline generating high-quality data with explicit evidence, fine-grained error labels, justifications, and corrections; 2) Construction of large-scale training data and manually verified benchmark InFi-Check-FG; 3) Development of InFi-Checker model that jointly provides evidence, classifies error types, and produces justifications with corrections.

Result: InFi-Checker achieves state-of-the-art performance on InFi-Check-FG benchmark and shows strong generalization across various downstream tasks, significantly improving utility and trustworthiness of factuality evaluation.

Conclusion: The InFi-Check framework provides a comprehensive solution for interpretable, fine-grained fact-checking of LLM outputs, addressing limitations of existing binary classification approaches and enhancing the utility and trustworthiness of factuality evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often hallucinate, yet most existing fact-checking methods treat factuality evaluation as a binary classification problem, offering limited interpretability and failing to capture fine-grained error types. In this paper, we introduce InFi-Check, a framework for interpretable and fine-grained fact-checking of LLM outputs. Specifically, we first propose a controlled data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality data featuring explicit evidence, fine-grained error type labels, justifications, and corrections. Based on this, we further construct large-scale training data and a manually verified benchmark InFi-Check-FG for fine-grained fact-checking of LLM outputs. Building on these high-quality training data, we further propose InFi-Checker, which can jointly provide supporting evidence, classify fine-grained error types, and produce justifications along with corrections. Experiments show that InFi-Checker achieves state-of-the-art performance on InFi-Check-FG and strong generalization across various downstream tasks, significantly improving the utility and trustworthiness of factuality evaluation.

*Adir Rahamim,Asaf Yehudai,Boaz Carmeli,Leshem Choshen,Yosi Mass,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates why some fine-tuned models merge better than others, proposing a measurable definition of "mergeability" and finding that base model knowledge is the dominant factor - models fine-tuned on instances the base model knows better are more mergeable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model merging is a promising technique for creating multitask models without retraining, but the factors determining merge success/failure remain poorly understood. The authors want to understand why specific models merge better than others.

Method: Proposed a concrete, measurable definition of mergeability. Investigated several potential causes for high/low mergeability, focusing on base model knowledge. Explored a simple weighted merging technique to better preserve weak knowledge in the base model.

Result: Found that base model knowledge is a dominant factor: models fine-tuned on instances that the base model knows better are more mergeable than models fine-tuned on instances the base model struggles with. The weighted merging technique helps preserve weak knowledge.

Conclusion: Understanding mergeability through base model knowledge provides insights for successful model merging. The proposed weighted merging approach offers a practical solution to preserve important knowledge during model combination.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for combining multiple fine-tuned models into a single multitask model without retraining. However, the factors that determine whether merging will succeed or fail remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why specific models are merged better than others. To do so, we propose a concrete, measurable definition of mergeability. We investigate several potential causes for high or low mergeability, highlighting the base model knowledge as a dominant factor: Models fine-tuned on instances that the base model knows better are more mergeable than models fine-tuned on instances that the base model struggles with. Based on our mergeability definition, we explore a simple weighted merging technique that better preserves weak knowledge in the base model.

*Tyler Lizzo,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of cross-lingual unlearning in multilingual LLMs shows most algorithms fail to remove facts outside training language, but subspace-projection works best by targeting shared interlingua structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well unlearning algorithms work across languages in multilingual LLMs, and understand the geometric structure of multilingual knowledge representation in weight space.

Method: Used translated TOFU benchmarks in seven language/script variants to test major unlearning algorithms, with focus on subspace-projection method and analysis of learned task subspaces.

Result: Most unlearning algorithms fail to remove facts outside the training language, but subspace-projection consistently outperforms others, achieving strong cross-lingual forgetting with minimal utility degradation. Analysis reveals shared interlingua structure in weight space.

Conclusion: Multilingual forgetting depends on geometry in weight space, motivating subspace-based approaches for future unlearning systems, with subspace-projection being the most effective method for cross-lingual unlearning.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive evaluation of cross-lingual unlearning in multilingual LLMs. Using translated TOFU benchmarks in seven language/script variants, we test major unlearning algorithms and show that most fail to remove facts outside the training language, even when utility remains high. However, subspace-projection consistently outperforms the other methods, achieving strong cross-lingual forgetting with minimal degradation. Analysis of learned task subspaces reveals a shared interlingua structure: removing this shared subspace harms all languages, while removing language-specific components selectively affects one. These results demonstrate that multilingual forgetting depends on geometry in weight space, motivating subspace-based approaches for future unlearning systems.

*Yingchaojie Feng,Qiang Huang,Xiaoya Xie,Zhaorui Yang,Jun Yu,Wei Chen,Anthony K. H. Tung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDRBench is the first benchmark for evaluating interactive deep research systems, measuring both benefits (quality/alignment) and costs (turns/tokens) of user interaction during research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep research systems operate autonomously, assuming fully specified user intent, but real research goals are often underspecified and evolve during exploration. Current benchmarks don't model dynamic user feedback or quantify interaction costs, making interaction largely invisible in evaluation.

Method: IDRBench combines: 1) modular multi-agent research framework with on-demand interaction, 2) scalable reference-grounded user simulator, and 3) interaction-aware evaluation suite that jointly measures interaction benefits (quality and alignment) and costs (turns and tokens).

Result: Experiments across seven state-of-the-art LLMs show that interaction consistently improves research quality and robustness, often outweighing differences in model capacity, while revealing substantial trade-offs in interaction efficiency.

Conclusion: Interaction is essential for robust alignment in deep research systems, and IDRBench provides the first systematic framework to evaluate interactive capabilities, revealing that interaction benefits often outweigh model capacity differences but come with efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: Deep research agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform multi-step reasoning, web exploration, and long-form report generation. However, most existing systems operate in an autonomous manner, assuming fully specified user intent and evaluating only final outputs. In practice, research goals are often underspecified and evolve during exploration, making sustained interaction essential for robust alignment. Despite its importance, interaction remains largely invisible to existing deep research benchmarks, which neither model dynamic user feedback nor quantify its costs. We introduce IDRBench, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating interactive deep research. IDRBench combines a modular multi-agent research framework with on-demand interaction, a scalable reference-grounded user simulator, and an interaction-aware evaluation suite that jointly measures interaction benefits (quality and alignment) and costs (turns and tokens). Experiments across seven state-of-the-art LLMs show that interaction consistently improves research quality and robustness, often outweighing differences in model capacity, while revealing substantial trade-offs in interaction efficiency.

### [54] [Characterising Toxicity in Generative Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06700)
*Zhiyao Zhang,Yazan Mash'Al,Yuhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs generate toxic content when prompted and analyzes linguistic factors influencing such outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in transformer-based language models and alignment methods like RLHF, LLMs remain vulnerable to generating toxic outputs when prompted with carefully crafted inputs. Current safeguards can be circumvented, creating a need to understand the extent and linguistic factors behind toxic content generation.

Method: The paper examines the extent of toxic content generation in LLMs through prompting experiments, analyzing both lexical and syntactic linguistic factors that influence the production of undesired outputs.

Result: The research likely reveals that LLMs can indeed generate toxic content when prompted, with specific lexical and syntactic patterns influencing the likelihood and nature of such outputs. The findings probably quantify the vulnerability of current models despite existing alignment methods.

Conclusion: Current LLM safeguards are insufficient against carefully crafted prompts, and understanding linguistic factors behind toxic generation is crucial for developing more robust alignment methods and safer language models.

Abstract: In recent years, the advent of the attention mechanism has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), revolutionizing text processing and text generation. This has come about through transformer-based decoder-only architectures, which have become ubiquitous in NLP due to their impressive text processing and generation capabilities. Despite these breakthroughs, language models (LMs) remain susceptible to generating undesired outputs: inappropriate, offensive, or otherwise harmful responses. We will collectively refer to these as ``toxic'' outputs. Although methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have been developed to align model outputs with human values, these safeguards can often be circumvented through carefully crafted prompts. Therefore, this paper examines the extent to which LLMs generate toxic content when prompted, as well as the linguistic factors -- both lexical and syntactic -- that influence the production of such outputs in generative models.

*Besher Hassan,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRASP LoRA introduces a learnable global sparsity controller that replaces grid search for adapter pruning, reducing compute and development set requirements while improving cross-lingual transfer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adapter fine-tuning methods use grid search to determine global prune ratios, which is computationally expensive, development set intensive, and suboptimal because it repeats training, freezes sparsity, and misses fractional optima.

Method: GRASP LoRA treats global sparsity as a learnable control variable using a GRPO controller that interleaves with training. It periodically probes candidate prune ratios on a small micro development set and updates a single global prune ratio online from reward signals. It operates on merged source and target LoRA adapters on a frozen backbone.

Result: On cross-lingual transfer from English to Arabic and Chinese (XL-Sum summarization and MLQA question answering with Llama 3 8B), GRASP LoRA improves semantic faithfulness, content coverage, and answer quality over target-only and merge-and-prune baselines. It reduces end-to-end runtime by multiple times relative to grid search and lowers reliance on large development sets.

Conclusion: GRASP LoRA makes adapter reuse practical for low-resource deployment by replacing expensive grid search with a single controller run that learns optimal prune ratios, followed by one final fine-tuning run with fixed pruning.

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning is a way to adapt LLMs to new languages when compute or data are limited, yet adapter pipelines usually choose a global prune ratio by grid search. This practice is computationally expensive and development set intensive, since it repeats training, freezes sparsity, and misses fractional optima. We introduce GRASP LoRA (GRPO Guided Adapter Sparsity Policy), which treats global sparsity as a learnable control variable. A GRPO controller interleaves with training, periodically probing candidate prune ratios on a small micro development set and updating a single global prune ratio online from its reward signal. It operates on merged source and target LoRA adapters on a frozen backbone and replaces grid search with one controller run that learns a prune ratio, followed by a single final merge and prune fine tuning run with pruning fixed to that ratio. On cross lingual transfer from English into Arabic and Chinese, including XL-Sum summarization and MLQA extractive question answering with Llama 3 8B, GRASP LoRA improves semantic faithfulness, content coverage, and answer quality over strong target only and merge and prune baselines. It reduces end to end runtime by multiple times relative to grid search, lowers reliance on large development sets, and makes adapter reuse practical for low resource deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are transforming professional domains, but effectively integrating them into specialized fields like accounting remains a challenge for enterprise digital transformation.

Method: Define vertical domain accounting reasoning and propose evaluation criteria based on GLM model training data analysis. Evaluate GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4 on accounting reasoning tasks using this framework.

Result: Prompt design significantly affects performance, with GPT-4 demonstrating the strongest capability. Despite improvements, current models remain insufficient for real-world enterprise accounting applications.

Conclusion: Further optimization is needed to unlock the full practical value of LLMs for enterprise accounting, as current models are not yet ready for real-world deployment despite promising capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models are transforming learning, cognition, and research across many fields. Effectively integrating them into professional domains, such as accounting, is a key challenge for enterprise digital transformation. To address this, we define vertical domain accounting reasoning and propose evaluation criteria derived from an analysis of the training data characteristics of representative GLM models. These criteria support systematic study of accounting reasoning and provide benchmarks for performance improvement. Using this framework, we evaluate GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4 on accounting reasoning tasks. Results show that prompt design significantly affects performance, with GPT-4 demonstrating the strongest capability. Despite these gains, current models remain insufficient for real-world enterprise accounting, indicating the need for further optimization to unlock their full practical value.

Motivation: The field of Chinese paleography is experiencing a computational revolution driven by AI, moving beyond simple automation toward comprehensive digital research ecosystems that can support scholarly work.

Method: The paper analyzes the field's methodological pipeline: from visual processing (image restoration, character recognition) to contextual analysis (artifact rejoining, dating) to advanced reasoning for automated decipherment and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Chinese paleography, the study of ancient Chinese writing, is undergoing a computational turn powered by artificial intelligence. This position paper charts the trajectory of this emerging field, arguing that it is evolving from automating isolated visual tasks to creating integrated digital ecosystems for scholarly research. We first map the landscape of digital resources, analyzing critical datasets for oracle bone, bronze, and bamboo slip scripts. The core of our analysis follows the field's methodological pipeline: from foundational visual processing (image restoration, character recognition), through contextual analysis (artifact rejoining, dating), to the advanced reasoning required for automated decipherment and human-AI collaboration. We examine the technological shift from classical computer vision to modern deep learning paradigms, including transformers and large multimodal models. Finally, we synthesize the field's core challenges -- notably data scarcity and a disconnect between current AI capabilities and the holistic nature of humanistic inquiry -- and advocate for a future research agenda focused on creating multimodal, few-shot, and human-centric systems to augment scholarly expertise.

*Zheyuan Liu,Dongwhi Kim,Yixin Wan,Xiangchi Yuan,Zhaoxuan Tan,Fengran Mo,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTMCS-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on contextual safety in multi-turn conversations, addressing limitations of existing single-turn benchmarks by testing escalation-based and context-switch risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contextual safety benchmarks are mostly single-turn and miss how malicious intent can emerge gradually or how the same scene can support both benign and exploitative goals. As MLLMs are increasingly deployed as assistants interacting through text and images, it's crucial to evaluate contextual safety when risk depends on both visual scenes and evolving dialogue.

Method: Introduces MTMCS-Bench with realistic images and multi-turn conversations evaluating contextual safety under two settings: escalation-based risk (gradual emergence of malicious intent) and context-switch risk (same scene supporting both benign and exploitative goals). Contains over 30k multimodal (image+text) and unimodal (text-only) samples with structured evaluation metrics.

Result: Across 15 models (8 open-source, 7 proprietary), persistent trade-offs between contextual safety and utility were observed - models either miss gradual risks or over-refuse benign dialogues. Evaluation of five current guardrails showed they mitigate some failures but don't fully resolve multi-turn contextual risks.

Conclusion: MTMCS-Bench addresses critical gaps in multimodal contextual safety evaluation, revealing persistent safety-utility trade-offs and limitations of current guardrails in handling multi-turn contextual risks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as assistants that interact through text and images, making it crucial to evaluate contextual safety when risk depends on both the visual scene and the evolving dialogue. Existing contextual safety benchmarks are mostly single-turn and often miss how malicious intent can emerge gradually or how the same scene can support both benign and exploitative goals. We introduce the Multi-Turn Multimodal Contextual Safety Benchmark (MTMCS-Bench), a benchmark of realistic images and multi-turn conversations that evaluates contextual safety in MLLMs under two complementary settings, escalation-based risk and context-switch risk. MTMCS-Bench offers paired safe and unsafe dialogues with structured evaluation. It contains over 30 thousand multimodal (image+text) and unimodal (text-only) samples, with metrics that separately measure contextual intent recognition, safety-awareness on unsafe cases, and helpfulness on benign ones. Across eight open-source and seven proprietary MLLMs, we observe persistent trade-offs between contextual safety and utility, with models tending to either miss gradual risks or over-refuse benign dialogues. Finally, we evaluate five current guardrails and find that they mitigate some failures but do not fully resolve multi-turn contextual risks.

### [59] [GanitLLM: Difficulty-Aware Bengali Mathematical Reasoning through Curriculum-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06767)
*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Khairul Mahbub,Nadia Najjar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GanitLLM is a 4B parameter Bengali mathematical reasoning model trained with a curriculum-based GRPO pipeline on a new difficulty-aware Bengali math corpus, achieving significant improvements over base models in accuracy and Bengali reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali is widely spoken but existing LLMs struggle with multi-step Bengali math reasoning - they either reason in English then translate or fail completely due to reward sparsity in low-resource language settings where standard reinforcement learning recipes collapse.

Method: 1) Constructed Ganit dataset: rigorously filtered and decontaminated Bengali math corpus with automatic difficulty tags based on pass@k of a strong evaluator model. 2) Curriculum-GRPO pipeline: combines multi-stage training (SFT + GRPO) with difficulty-aware sampling and verifiable rewards for format, numerical correctness, and Bengali reasoning.

Result: GanitLLM-4B improves over Qwen3-4B base by +8 accuracy points on Bn-MGSM and +7 on Bn-MSVAMP, increases Bengali reasoning tokens from 14% to over 88%, and reduces average solution length from 943 to 193 words.

Conclusion: The proposed difficulty-aware Bengali math corpus and Curriculum-GRPO pipeline effectively address reward sparsity in low-resource languages, enabling high-quality Bengali mathematical reasoning with significant improvements in accuracy, reasoning quality, and conciseness.

Abstract: We present a Bengali mathematical reasoning model called GanitLLM (named after the Bangla word for mathematics, "Ganit"), together with a new difficulty-aware Bengali math corpus and a curriculum-based GRPO pipeline. Bengali is one of the world's most widely spoken languages, yet existing LLMs either reason in English and then translate, or simply fail on multi-step Bengali math, in part because reinforcement learning recipes are tuned for high-resource languages and collapse under reward sparsity in low-resource settings. To address this, we construct Ganit, a rigorously filtered and decontaminated Bengali math dataset with automatic difficulty tags derived from the pass@k of a strong evaluator model. Building on this dataset, we propose Curriculum-GRPO, which combines multi-stage training (SFT + GRPO) with difficulty-aware sampling and verifiable rewards for format, numerical correctness, and Bengali reasoning. On Bn-MGSM and Bn-MSVAMP, GanitLLM-4B improves over its Qwen3-4B base by +8 and +7 accuracy points, respectively, while increasing the percentage of Bengali reasoning tokens from 14% to over 88% and reducing average solution length from 943 to 193 words.

*Keito Inoshita,Xiaokang Zhou,Akira Kawai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEM-MCL: A hybrid model combining evolutionary model merging with metadata-driven curriculum learning to improve LLM performance on multiple sentiment analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sentiment analysis methods focus on individual tasks, but real-world applications require handling multiple tasks simultaneously. LLMs offer flexibility but lack required accuracy for sentiment-specific tasks. There's a need for unified frameworks that can improve learning performance while reducing computational costs, with task metadata and curriculum learning being underexplored areas.

Method: Multi-stage Evolutionary Model Merging with Metadata-driven Curriculum Learning (MEM-MCL): 1) Create expert models through instruction tuning for specific sentiment tasks, 2) Merge expert models using evolutionary algorithms to form a unified model, 3) Optimize merging process with weak data, 4) Incorporate curriculum learning to provide learning sequence based on task difficulty.

Result: The proposed MEM-MCL model outperforms conventional LLMs in a majority of sentiment analysis tasks, achieving superior results across various subtasks.

Conclusion: MEM-MCL effectively enhances sentiment analysis in large language modeling by combining evolutionary model merging with curriculum learning, addressing the limitations of traditional methods and improving performance across multiple sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling more generalized models to perform various tasks with minimal training. However, traditional sentiment analysis methods, which focus on individual tasks such as sentiment classification or aspect-based analysis, are not practical for real-world applications that usually require handling multiple tasks. While offering flexibility, LLMs in sentiment-specific tasks often fall short of the required accuracy. Techniques like fine-tuning and evolutionary model merging help integrate models into a unified framework, which can improve the learning performance while reducing computational costs. The use of task meta-data and curriculum learning to optimize learning processes remains underexplored, while sentiment analysis is a critical task in NLP that requires high accuracy and scalability across multiple subtasks. In this study, we propose a hybrid learning model called Multi-stage Evolutionary Model Merging with Meta data driven Curriculum Learning (MEM-MCL), to enhance the sentiment analysis in large language modeling. In particular, expert models are created through instruction tuning for specific sentiment tasks and then merged using evolutionary algorithms to form a unified model. The merging process is optimized with weak data to enhance performance across tasks. The curriculum learning is incorporated to provide a learning sequence based on task difficulty, improving knowledge extraction from LLMs. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed MEM-MCL model outperforms conventional LLMs in a majority of sentiment analysis tasks, achieving superior results across various subtasks.

*Jewon Yeom,Jaewon Sok,Seonghyeon Park,Jeongjae Park,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EpiCaR improves LLM reasoning by jointly optimizing accuracy and calibration, preventing overconfidence and enabling 3x compute reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-training approaches for LLM reasoning boost accuracy but cause overconfidence and poor calibration, leading to model collapse where models lose uncertainty representation.

Method: Proposes epistemically-calibrated reasoning (EpiCaR) as a training objective that jointly optimizes reasoning performance and calibration, implemented via iterative supervised fine-tuning with explicit self-evaluation signals.

Result: Achieves Pareto-superiority in both accuracy and calibration on Llama-3 and Qwen-3 families (3B+ models), generalizes to OOD mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and code generation (MBPP), and enables 3X inference compute reduction.

Conclusion: Reframing reasoning training as epistemic learning enables models to learn both how to reason and when to trust their reasoning, preventing calibration collapse while maintaining performance gains.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has largely relied on iterative self-training with model-generated data. While effective at boosting accuracy, existing approaches primarily reinforce successful reasoning paths, incurring a substantial calibration cost: models become overconfident and lose the ability to represent uncertainty. This failure has been characterized as a form of model collapse in alignment, where predictive distributions degenerate toward low-variance point estimates. We address this issue by reframing reasoning training as an epistemic learning problem, in which models must learn not only how to reason, but also when their reasoning should be trusted. We propose epistemically-calibrated reasoning (EpiCaR) as a training objective that jointly optimizes reasoning performance and calibration, and instantiate it within an iterative supervised fine-tuning framework using explicit self-evaluation signals. Experiments on Llama-3 and Qwen-3 families demonstrate that our approach achieves Pareto-superiority over standard baselines in both accuracy and calibration, particularly in models with sufficient reasoning capacity (e.g., 3B+). This framework generalizes effectively to OOD mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and code generation (MBPP). Ultimately, our approach enables a 3X reduction in inference compute, matching the K=30 performance of STaR with only K=10 samples in capable models.

*Jaewon Sok,Jewon Yeom,Seonghyeon Park,Jeongjae Park,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies the BOS sink phenomenon as the key mechanism explaining why higher layers in LLMs are more redundant, and introduces a pruning strategy based on BOS sink scores that outperforms magnitude-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs contain significant redundancy, especially in higher layers, but there hasn't been a systematic explanation for why certain components are more redundant. Prior studies noted structural redundancy but lacked a concrete functional explanation.

Method: The authors identify the BOS sink phenomenon where attention heads with high BOS sink scores act as "dumping grounds" for superfluous attention weights. They introduce a pruning strategy that removes high-BOS sink heads, using this structural property rather than weight or activation magnitudes.

Result: Experiments on Gemma-3, Llama-3.1, and Qwen3 show this approach identifies redundant components more reliably than weight- or activation-based criteria, preserves performance close to dense baselines even under aggressive pruning, and the behavior remains stable across different sequence lengths.

Conclusion: Structural properties of attention (specifically BOS sink phenomenon) offer a more intuitive and robust basis for model compression than magnitude-based methods, providing a concrete functional explanation for layer-wise redundancy in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to contain significant redundancy, yet a systematic explanation for why certain components, particularly in higher layers, are more redundant has remained elusive. In this work, we identify the BOS sink phenomenon as a key mechanism driving this layer-wise sensitivity. We show that attention heads with high BOS sink scores are strongly associated with functional redundancy: such heads, especially in deeper layers, contribute little to predictive performance and effectively serve as \emph{dumping grounds} for superfluous attention weights. This provides a concrete functional explanation for the structural redundancy reported in prior studies. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a simple pruning strategy that removes high-BOS sink heads. Experiments on Gemma-3, Llama-3.1, and Qwen3 demonstrate that this approach identifies redundant transformer components more reliably than weight- or activation-based criteria, while preserving performance close to dense baselines even under aggressive pruning. Moreover, we find that the behavior of sink heads remains stable across different sequence lengths. Overall, our results suggest that structural properties of attention offer a more intuitive and robust basis for model compression than magnitude-based methods.

*Zili Wei,Xiaocui Yang,Yilin Wang,Zihan Wang,Weidong Bao,Shi Feng,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIRAG improves multi-hop QA by addressing greedy expansion and granularity mismatch through iterative construction-integration and adaptive multi-granularity generation, with trajectory distillation for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iRAG methods have two key limitations: (1) greedy single-path expansion that propagates early errors and misses parallel evidence from different reasoning branches, and (2) granularity-demand mismatch where a single evidence representation can't balance noise control with contextual sufficiency.

Method: Proposes CIRAG with three main components: (1) Iterative Construction-Integration module that constructs candidate triples and integrates them history-conditionally to distill core triples and generate next-hop queries, (2) Adaptive Cascaded Multi-Granularity Generation that progressively expands contextual evidence from triples to sentences to full passages based on problem needs, and (3) Trajectory Distillation that distills teacher model's integration policy into lightweight student for efficient long-horizon reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CIRAG achieves superior performance compared to existing iRAG methods.

Conclusion: CIRAG effectively addresses the limitations of existing iRAG approaches by mitigating greedy expansion traps through multi-path preservation and solving granularity mismatch through adaptive evidence expansion, while maintaining efficiency through distillation.

Abstract: Triple-based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (iRAG) mitigates document-level noise for multi-hop question answering. However, existing methods still face limitations: (i) greedy single-path expansion, which propagates early errors and fails to capture parallel evidence from different reasoning branches, and (ii) granularity-demand mismatch, where a single evidence representation struggles to balance noise control with contextual sufficiency. In this paper, we propose the Construction-Integration Retrieval and Adaptive Generation model, CIRAG. It introduces an Iterative Construction-Integration module that constructs candidate triples and history-conditionally integrates them to distill core triples and generate the next-hop query. This module mitigates the greedy trap by preserving multiple plausible evidence chains. Besides, we propose an Adaptive Cascaded Multi-Granularity Generation module that progressively expands contextual evidence based on the problem requirements, from triples to supporting sentences and full passages. Moreover, we introduce Trajectory Distillation, which distills the teacher model's integration policy into a lightweight student, enabling efficient and reliable long-horizon reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CIRAG achieves superior performance compared to existing iRAG methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first benchmark for Sudanese Arabic ASR using data augmentation techniques to fine-tune Whisper models, achieving significant improvements over existing models despite limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of dialect-specific ASR systems for low-resource Arabic dialects like Sudanese, with most existing work focusing on Modern Standard Arabic or better-resourced dialects.

Method: Fine-tuned OpenAI Whisper models using two data augmentation strategies: (1) self-training with pseudo-labels from unlabeled speech, and (2) TTS-based augmentation using synthetic speech from Klaam TTS system. Used low-cost resources (Kaggle free tier and Lightning.ai trial).

Result: Best model (Whisper-Medium with combined self-training and TTS augmentation) achieved 57.1% WER on evaluation set and 51.6% on out-of-domain holdout set, substantially outperforming zero-shot multilingual Whisper (78.8% WER) and MSA-specialized Arabic models (73.8-123% WER).

Conclusion: Strategic data augmentation can overcome resource limitations for low-resource dialects, providing a practical roadmap for developing ASR systems for marginalized language varieties. All models, benchmarks, and training pipelines are publicly released.

Abstract: Although many Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have been developed for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal Arabic (DA), few studies have focused on dialect-specific implementations, particularly for low-resource Arabic dialects such as Sudanese. This paper presents a comprehensive study of data augmentation techniques for fine-tuning OpenAI Whisper models and establishes the first benchmark for the Sudanese dialect. Two augmentation strategies are investigated: (1) self-training with pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled speech, and (2) TTS-based augmentation using synthetic speech from the Klaam TTS system. The best-performing model, Whisper-Medium fine-tuned with combined self-training and TTS augmentation (28.4 hours), achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 57.1% on the evaluation set and 51.6% on an out-of-domain holdout set substantially outperforming zero-shot multilingual Whisper (78.8% WER) and MSA-specialized Arabic models (73.8-123% WER). All experiments used low-cost resources (Kaggle free tier and Lightning.ai trial), demonstrating that strategic data augmentation can overcome resource limitations for low-resource dialects and provide a practical roadmap for developing ASR systems for low-resource Arabic dialects and other marginalized language varieties. The models, evaluation benchmarks, and reproducible training pipelines are publicly released to facilitate future research on low-resource Arabic ASR.

*Yubo Wang,Juntian Zhang,Yichen Wu,Yankai Lin,Nils Lukas,Yuhan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Laser introduces Dynamic Windowed Alignment Learning for visual reasoning, maintaining global feature superpositions before local details, achieving SOTA with 97% fewer inference tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning suffers from information bottleneck where visual details are lost during tokenization, and existing latent reasoning methods experience premature semantic collapse due to rigid autoregressive objectives.

Method: Proposes Laser with Dynamic Windowed Alignment Learning (DWAL) that aligns latent states with dynamic validity windows of future semantics, enforcing "Forest-before-Trees" hierarchy with Self-Refined Superposition for interpretable trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among latent reasoning methods, surpassing Monet baseline by 5.03% average on 6 benchmarks, with 97% fewer inference tokens and robust out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: Laser provides an efficient, interpretable paradigm for visual reasoning that overcomes information bottlenecks and semantic collapse while maintaining computational efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought empowers Large Vision-Language Models with multi-step reasoning, explicit textual rationales suffer from an information bandwidth bottleneck, where continuous visual details are discarded during discrete tokenization. Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to address this challenge, but often fall prey to premature semantic collapse due to rigid autoregressive objectives. In this paper, we propose Laser, a novel paradigm that reformulates visual deduction via Dynamic Windowed Alignment Learning (DWAL). Instead of forcing a point-wise prediction, Laser aligns the latent state with a dynamic validity window of future semantics. This mechanism enforces a "Forest-before-Trees" cognitive hierarchy, enabling the model to maintain a probabilistic superposition of global features before narrowing down to local details. Crucially, Laser maintains interpretability via decodable trajectories while stabilizing unconstrained learning via Self-Refined Superposition. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks demonstrate that Laser achieves state-of-the-art performance among latent reasoning methods, surpassing the strong baseline Monet by 5.03% on average. Notably, it achieves these gains with extreme efficiency, reducing inference tokens by more than 97%, while demonstrating robust generalization to out-of-distribution domains.

*Xuannan Liu,Xiao Yang,Zekun Li,Peipei Li,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentHallu benchmark for automated hallucination attribution in LLM-based agents: identifies which step causes hallucinations in multi-step workflows with comprehensive annotations across 7 frameworks and 5 domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLM-based agents propagate through sequential reasoning steps, degrading reliability. Current hallucination detection focuses on single-turn responses, but multi-step workflows need identification of which specific step causes the initial divergence.

Method: Proposed automated hallucination attribution task and introduced AgentHallu benchmark with: (1) 693 high-quality trajectories across 7 agent frameworks and 5 domains, (2) hallucination taxonomy with 5 categories and 14 sub-categories, (3) multi-level human annotations including binary labels, responsible steps, and causal explanations.

Result: Evaluation of 13 leading models shows the task is challenging: best model achieves only 41.1% step localization accuracy. Tool-use hallucinations are most difficult (11.6% accuracy). GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle with the task.

Conclusion: AgentHallu benchmark will catalyze research into developing robust, transparent, and reliable agentic systems by addressing the critical problem of hallucination attribution in multi-step agent workflows.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents operate over sequential multi-step reasoning, hallucinations arising at intermediate steps risk propagating along the trajectory, thus degrading overall reliability. Unlike hallucination detection in single-turn responses, diagnosing hallucinations in multi-step workflows requires identifying which step causes the initial divergence. To fill this gap, we propose a new research task, automated hallucination attribution of LLM-based agents, aiming to identify the step responsible for the hallucination and explain why. To support this task, we introduce AgentHallu, a comprehensive benchmark with: (1) 693 high-quality trajectories spanning 7 agent frameworks and 5 domains, (2) a hallucination taxonomy organized into 5 categories (Planning, Retrieval, Reasoning, Human-Interaction, and Tool-Use) and 14 sub-categories, and (3) multi-level annotations curated by humans, covering binary labels, hallucination-responsible steps, and causal explanations. We evaluate 13 leading models, and results show the task is challenging even for top-tier models (like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro). The best-performing model achieves only 41.1\% step localization accuracy, where tool-use hallucinations are the most challenging at just 11.6\%. We believe AgentHallu will catalyze future research into developing robust, transparent, and reliable agentic systems.

*Jinhan Liu,Yibo Yang,Ruiying Lu,Piotr Piekos,Yimeng Chen,Peng Wang,Dandan Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PDR is a training-free framework that reweights token-level scores in LLM memorization detection by amplifying early high-entropy tokens and suppressing later noisy ones, improving existing methods across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting pre-training data in LLMs is crucial for privacy and copyright auditing but challenging in black-box, zero-shot settings with limited resources. Existing likelihood-based methods use uniform token weighting, ignoring the information-theoretic dynamics of autoregressive generation where memorization signals are strongest in early high-entropy tokens.

Method: Introduces Positional Decay Reweighting (PDR), a training-free plug-and-play framework that reweights token-level scores based on linguistic properties. PDR amplifies distinct signals from early positions (where model uncertainty is highest) while suppressing noise from later positions as context accumulates.

Result: Extensive experiments show PDR acts as a robust prior and can enhance a wide range of advanced methods across multiple benchmarks for detecting pre-training data in LLMs.

Conclusion: PDR effectively leverages the linguistic property that memorization signals are skewed toward high-entropy initial tokens, providing a simple yet effective enhancement to existing detection methods without requiring training or additional resources.

Abstract: Detecting pre-training data in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for auditing data privacy and copyright compliance, yet it remains challenging in black-box, zero-shot settings where computational resources and training data are scarce. While existing likelihood-based methods have shown promise, they typically aggregate token-level scores using uniform weights, thereby neglecting the inherent information-theoretic dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we hypothesize and empirically validate that memorization signals are heavily skewed towards the high-entropy initial tokens, where model uncertainty is highest, and decay as context accumulates. To leverage this linguistic property, we introduce Positional Decay Reweighting (PDR), a training-free and plug-and-play framework. PDR explicitly reweights token-level scores to amplify distinct signals from early positions while suppressing noise from later ones. Extensive experiments show that PDR acts as a robust prior and can usually enhance a wide range of advanced methods across multiple benchmarks.

*Zhongzheng Wang,Yuanhe Tian,Hongzhi Wang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reformulates Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) as a generative and explainable task using multimodal large language models, achieving better sentiment classification while generating aspect-grounded explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MABSA approaches rely on discriminative classification with complex multimodal fusion but lack explicit sentiment explainability. The authors aim to create a framework that not only predicts sentiment but also generates natural language explanations for better interpretability.

Method: The authors propose a unified generative framework using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with a prompt-based paradigm. They introduce a dependency-syntax-guided sentiment cue strategy that prunes and textualizes aspect-centered dependency syntax trees to enhance aspect-oriented reasoning. They also construct new datasets with sentiment explanations using MLLMs for fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show the approach achieves consistent gains in sentiment classification accuracy compared to existing methods, while also producing faithful, aspect-grounded natural language explanations that enhance interpretability.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that reformulating MABSA as a generative and explainable task using MLLMs with dependency-syntax guidance improves both sentiment prediction accuracy and explainability, offering a more comprehensive solution for fine-grained opinion understanding in social media.

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to identify aspect-level sentiments by jointly modeling textual and visual information, which is essential for fine-grained opinion understanding in social media. Existing approaches mainly rely on discriminative classification with complex multimodal fusion, yet lacking explicit sentiment explainability. In this paper, we reformulate MABSA as a generative and explainable task, proposing a unified framework that simultaneously predicts aspect-level sentiment and generates natural language explanations. Based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs), our approach employs a prompt-based generative paradigm, jointly producing sentiment and explanation. To further enhance aspect-oriented reasoning capabilities, we propose a dependency-syntax-guided sentiment cue strategy. This strategy prunes and textualizes the aspect-centered dependency syntax tree, guiding the model to distinguish different sentiment aspects and enhancing its explainability. To enable explainability, we use MLLMs to construct new datasets with sentiment explanations to fine-tune. Experiments show that our approach not only achieves consistent gains in sentiment classification accuracy, but also produces faithful, aspect-grounded explanations.

TL;DR: DISTRACTMATH-BN benchmark tests CoT reasoning robustness in Bangla math problems with irrelevant context; models degrade significantly; DAGGER method uses computational graphs to improve efficiency and robustness without explicit distractor training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting is widely used for mathematical problem solving in low-resource languages, but its behavior when faced with semantically coherent but computationally irrelevant information (distractors) remains underexplored.

Method: 1) Introduce DISTRACTMATH-BN benchmark (Bangla) augmenting MGSM and MSVAMP with irrelevant context; 2) Evaluate 7 models (3B-12B parameters); 3) Propose DAGGER method that reformulates math problem solving as executable computational graph generation with explicit distractor node modeling; 4) Fine-tune Gemma-3 models using supervised fine-tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Standard models drop performance by up to 41 points under distractors; reasoning-specialized models decline 14-20 points despite 5x more tokens. DAGGER achieves comparable weighted accuracy on augmented benchmarks while using 89% fewer tokens than reasoning models, with robustness emerging without explicit training on distractor-augmented examples.

Conclusion: Enforcing structured intermediate representations (computational graphs) improves robustness and inference efficiency in mathematical reasoning compared to free-form approaches, particularly in noisy, low-resource settings.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely adopted for mathematical problem solving, including in low-resource languages, yet its behavior under irrelevant context remains underexplored. To systematically study this challenge, we introduce DISTRACTMATH-BN, a Bangla benchmark that augments MGSM and MSVAMP with semantically coherent but computationally irrelevant information. Evaluating seven models ranging from 3B to 12B parameters, we observe substantial performance degradation under distractors: standard models drop by up to 41 points, while reasoning-specialized models decline by 14 to 20 points despite consuming five times more tokens. We propose †DAGGER, which reformulates mathematical problem solving as executable computational graph generation with explicit modeling of distractor nodes. Fine-tuning Gemma-3 models using supervised fine-tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization achieves comparable weighted accuracy on augmented benchmarks while using 89 percent fewer tokens than reasoning models. Importantly, this robustness emerges without explicit training on distractor-augmented examples. Our results suggest that enforcing structured intermediate representations improves robustness and inference efficiency in mathematical reasoning compared to free-form approaches, particularly in noisy, low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasLab is an open-source framework for evaluating bias in LLM outputs across languages using mirrored probe pairs, randomized prompts, and standardized metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM bias evaluation faces challenges: sensitivity to prompt wording, limited multilingual coverage, and lack of standardized metrics for reliable cross-model comparison, especially important for high-stakes deployment decisions.

Method: Uses mirrored probe pairs with dual-framing (affirmative vs. reverse assertions), randomized instructional wrappers, fixed-choice Likert responses, LLM-based judge for normalization, and quantitative bias indicators with effect sizes and neutrality rates.

Result: BiasLab provides a standardized methodology for cross-lingual, framing-sensitive bias measurement that complements existing audits, enabling reproducible artifacts like structured reports and comparative visualizations.

Conclusion: BiasLab offers a robust framework for benchmarking LLM bias across diverse topics and languages, helping researchers and institutions make better-informed deployment decisions through standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts where their outputs influence real-world decisions. However, evaluating bias in LLM outputs remains methodologically challenging due to sensitivity to prompt wording, limited multilingual coverage, and the lack of standardized metrics that enable reliable comparison across models. This paper introduces BiasLab, an open-source, model-agnostic evaluation framework for quantifying output-level (extrinsic) bias through a multilingual, robustness-oriented experimental design. BiasLab constructs mirrored probe pairs under a strict dual-framing scheme: an affirmative assertion favoring Target A and a reverse assertion obtained by deterministic target substitution favoring Target B, while preserving identical linguistic structure. To reduce dependence on prompt templates, BiasLab performs repeated evaluation under randomized instructional wrappers and enforces a fixed-choice Likert response format to maximize comparability across models and languages. Responses are normalized into agreement labels using an LLM-based judge, aligned for polarity consistency across framings, and aggregated into quantitative bias indicators with descriptive statistics including effect sizes and neutrality rates. The framework supports evaluation across diverse bias axes, including demographic, cultural, political, and geopolitical topics, and produces reproducible artifacts such as structured reports and comparative visualizations. BiasLab contributes a standardized methodology for cross-lingual and framing-sensitive bias measurement that complements intrinsic and dataset-based audits, enabling researchers and institutions to benchmark robustness and make better-informed deployment decisions.

### [71] [Paraphrasing Adversarial Attack on LLM-as-a-Reviewer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06884)
*Masahiro Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAA is a black-box adversarial attack that paraphrases papers to increase review scores while preserving meaning, revealing LLM vulnerabilities in peer review systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in peer review, but their vulnerabilities need examination. Previous attacks rely on prompt injection, which changes manuscript content and confuses injection susceptibility with evaluation robustness.

Method: Paraphrasing Adversarial Attack (PAA) - a black-box optimization method that searches for semantically equivalent paraphrases yielding higher review scores while maintaining naturalness. Uses in-context learning with previous paraphrases and scores to guide candidate generation.

Result: PAA consistently increases review scores across 5 conferences with 3 LLM reviewers and 5 attacking models, without changing paper claims. Human evaluation confirms paraphrases maintain meaning and naturalness. Attacked papers show increased perplexity in reviews (detection signal), and paraphrasing submissions can partially mitigate attacks.

Conclusion: PAA reveals significant vulnerabilities in LLM-based peer review systems, demonstrating that semantic-preserving paraphrasing can manipulate scores. Increased perplexity offers detection potential, and defensive paraphrasing provides partial mitigation.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in peer review systems has attracted growing attention, making it essential to examine their potential vulnerabilities. Prior attacks rely on prompt injection, which alters manuscript content and conflates injection susceptibility with evaluation robustness. We propose the Paraphrasing Adversarial Attack (PAA), a black-box optimization method that searches for paraphrased sequences yielding higher review scores while preserving semantic equivalence and linguistic naturalness. PAA leverages in-context learning, using previous paraphrases and their scores to guide candidate generation. Experiments across five ML and NLP conferences with three LLM reviewers and five attacking models show that PAA consistently increases review scores without changing the paper's claims. Human evaluation confirms that generated paraphrases maintain meaning and naturalness. We also find that attacked papers exhibit increased perplexity in reviews, offering a potential detection signal, and that paraphrasing submissions can partially mitigate attacks.

### [72] [Fine-grained Verbal Attack Detection via a Hierarchical Divide-and-Conquer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06907)
*Quan Zheng,Yuanhe Tian,Ming Wang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hierarchical attack detection framework for Chinese social media that uses structured task decomposition to outperform larger models by better capturing conversational context and implicit attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verbal attack detection research lacks proper modeling of conversational structure and contextual dependencies, especially for implicit attacks prevalent in Chinese social media. Current approaches focus on general semantics while ignoring user response relationships.

Method: Proposes a divide-and-conquer framework with specialized lightweight models handling explicit detection, implicit intent inference, and target identification. Introduces a novel dataset encoding hierarchical reply structures and chronological order to capture multi-turn interaction patterns.

Result: Smaller models using the structured decomposition framework significantly outperform larger monolithic models that rely on parameter scaling, demonstrating effectiveness on both the proposed dataset and benchmark intention detection datasets.

Conclusion: Structured task decomposition with specialized lightweight models is more effective than parameter scaling for verbal attack detection, particularly for capturing implicit attacks and conversational context in Chinese social media.

Abstract: In the digital era, effective identification and analysis of verbal attacks are essential for maintaining online civility and ensuring social security. However, existing research is limited by insufficient modeling of conversational structure and contextual dependency, particularly in Chinese social media where implicit attacks are prevalent. Current attack detection studies often emphasize general semantic understanding while overlooking user response relationships, hindering the identification of implicit and context-dependent attacks. To address these challenges, we present the novel "Hierarchical Attack Comment Detection" dataset and propose a divide-and-conquer, fine-grained framework for verbal attack recognition based on spatiotemporal information. The proposed dataset explicitly encodes hierarchical reply structures and chronological order, capturing complex interaction patterns in multi-turn discussions. Building on this dataset, the framework decomposes attack detection into hierarchical subtasks, where specialized lightweight models handle explicit detection, implicit intent inference, and target identification under constrained context. Extensive experiments on the proposed dataset and benchmark intention detection datasets show that smaller models using our framework significantly outperform larger monolithic models relying on parameter scaling, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured task decomposition.

### [73] [Distributional Clarity: The Hidden Driver of RL-Friendliness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06911)
*Shaoning Sun,Mingzhu Cai,Huang He,Bingjin Chen,Siqi Bao,Yujiu Yang,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies "distributional clarity" as a key structural property that determines how well language models benefit from reinforcement learning, showing that models with clear probability separation between correct/incorrect responses achieve better RL gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different language model families show significant disparity in their ability to benefit from reinforcement learning under identical training conditions, with some models achieving substantial gains while others show limited improvement. The authors seek to understand the underlying structural reasons for this disparity beyond data-centric approaches.

Method: Three-stage analysis: from phenomenon to mechanism to interpretation. They quantify "distributional clarity" using the Silhouette Coefficient (S) to measure intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in probability assignments. They also introduce a Silhouette-Aware Reweighting strategy that prioritizes low-S samples during training to validate the property.

Result: High Silhouette Coefficient correlates strongly with RL performance, while low S is associated with logic errors and reasoning instability. Experiments across six mathematical benchmarks show consistent improvements across all model families, with gains up to 5.9 points on AIME24.

Conclusion: Distributional clarity is established as a fundamental, trainable property underlying RL-Friendliness, providing a structural explanation for why some models benefit more from reinforcement learning than others.

Abstract: Language model families exhibit striking disparity in their capacity to benefit from reinforcement learning: under identical training, models like Qwen achieve substantial gains, while others like Llama yield limited improvements. Complementing data-centric approaches, we reveal that this disparity reflects a hidden structural property: \textbf{distributional clarity} in probability space. Through a three-stage analysis-from phenomenon to mechanism to interpretation-we uncover that RL-friendly models exhibit intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in their probability assignments to correct vs. incorrect responses. We quantify this clarity using the \textbf{Silhouette Coefficient} ($S$) and demonstrate that (1) high $S$ correlates strongly with RL performance; (2) low $S$ is associated with severe logic errors and reasoning instability. To confirm this property, we introduce a Silhouette-Aware Reweighting strategy that prioritizes low-$S$ samples during training. Experiments across six mathematical benchmarks show consistent improvements across all model families, with gains up to 5.9 points on AIME24. Our work establishes distributional clarity as a fundamental, trainable property underlying RL-Friendliness.

*Tianhua Zhang,Kun Li,Junan Li,Yunxiang Li,Hongyin Luo,Xixin Wu,James Glass,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TreePS-RAG: An online, tree-based RL framework for agentic RAG that enables step-wise credit assignment using only outcome rewards, outperforming both outcome-supervised and process-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for agentic RAG rely on sparse final rewards which limit step-wise credit assignment and provide weak guidance for intermediate reasoning. Process-level supervision methods either depend on offline data (risking distribution shift) or require costly intermediate annotations.

Method: Models agentic RAG reasoning as a rollout tree where each reasoning step maps to a node. Uses Monte Carlo estimation over descendant outcomes to estimate step utility, enabling fine-grained process advantages without intermediate labels. Introduces efficient online tree construction strategy to preserve exploration diversity under computational constraints.

Result: Experiments on seven multi-hop and general QA benchmarks across multiple model scales show TreePS-RAG consistently and significantly outperforms both outcome-supervised and leading process-supervised RL methods, with rollout cost comparable to strong baselines like Search-R1.

Conclusion: TreePS-RAG provides an effective online RL framework for agentic RAG that enables step-wise credit assignment using only outcome rewards, addressing limitations of both sparse reward and process-supervised approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) formulates question answering as a multi-step interaction between reasoning and information retrieval, and has recently been advanced by reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision. While effective, relying solely on sparse final rewards limits step-wise credit assignment and provides weak guidance for intermediate reasoning and actions. Recent efforts explore process-level supervision, but typically depend on offline constructed training data, which risks distribution shift, or require costly intermediate annotations. We present TreePS-RAG, an online, tree-based RL framework for agentic RAG that enables step-wise credit assignment while retaining standard outcome-only rewards. Our key insight is to model agentic RAG reasoning as a rollout tree, where each reasoning step naturally maps to a node. This tree structure allows step utility to be estimated via Monte Carlo estimation over its descendant outcomes, yielding fine-grained process advantages without requiring intermediate labels. To make this paradigm practical, we introduce an efficient online tree construction strategy that preserves exploration diversity under a constrained computational budget. With a rollout cost comparable to strong baselines like Search-R1, experiments on seven multi-hop and general QA benchmarks across multiple model scales show that TreePS-RAG consistently and significantly outperforms both outcome-supervised and leading process-supervised RL methods.

*Stephen Gadd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Symphonym is a neural embedding system that maps place names from 20 writing systems into a unified phonetic space, enabling cross-script toponym matching without runtime phonetic conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing phonetic algorithms and transliteration rules fail when place names cross script boundaries, making it impossible to determine that names like "Moscow" in different scripts refer to the same city.

Method: Uses a Teacher-Student architecture: Teacher network trained on articulatory phonetic features produces target embeddings, while Student network learns to approximate these from raw characters. Three-phase curriculum training on 57M toponyms with hard negative triplets.

Result: Achieves 89.2% Recall@1 on Hebrew-Arabic benchmark, outperforming Levenshtein (81.5%) and Jaro-Winkler (78.5%). Student network achieves 96.6% cosine similarity to Teacher with only 1.7M parameters.

Conclusion: Symphonym enables effective cross-script toponym matching and will support fuzzy phonetic reconciliation across the World Historical Gazetteer's 67 million place names.

Abstract: Linking place names across languages and writing systems is a fundamental challenge in digital humanities and geographic information retrieval. Existing approaches rely on language-specific phonetic algorithms or transliteration rules that fail when names cross script boundaries -- no string metric can determine that "Moscow" when rendered in Cyrillic or Arabic refer to the same city.
  I present Symphonym, a neural embedding system that maps toponyms from 20 writing systems into a unified 128-dimensional phonetic space. A Teacher network trained on articulatory phonetic features (via Epitran and PanPhon) produces target embeddings, while a Student network learns to approximate these from raw characters. At inference, only the lightweight Student (1.7M parameters) is required, enabling deployment without runtime phonetic conversion.
  Training uses a three-phase curriculum on 57 million toponyms from GeoNames, Wikidata, and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Phase 1 trains the Teacher on 467K phonetically-grounded triplets. Phase 2 aligns the Student to Teacher outputs across 23M samples, achieving 96.6% cosine similarity. Phase 3 fine-tunes on 3.3M hard negative triplets -- negatives sharing prefix and script with the anchor but referring to different places -- to sharpen discrimination.
  Evaluation on the MEHDIE Hebrew-Arabic benchmark achieves 89.2% Recall@1, outperforming Levenshtein (81.5%) and Jaro-Winkler (78.5%). The system is optimised for cross-script matching; same-script variants can be handled by complementary string methods. Symphonym will enable fuzzy phonetic reconciliation and search across the World Historical Gazetteer's 67 million toponyms. Code and models are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Code LLMs trained entirely on synthetic data (SynthSmith pipeline) achieve competitive performance on programming benchmarks without real-world data, showing scaling laws hold for synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Code LLMs rely heavily on real-world data, limiting scalability. Competitive programming requires intensive reasoning that current models struggle with, creating a need for synthetic approaches that don't depend on real-world coding data.

Method: Developed SynthSmith, a feature-based synthesis pipeline that generates diverse tasks, verified solutions, and test cases entirely synthetically. Used this to create synthetic SFT and RL datasets, then trained the X-Coder model series (7B parameters) with staged training.

Result: X-Coder achieves 62.9 avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5 and 55.8 on v6, outperforming larger models (DeepCoder-14B-Preview and AReal-boba2-14B). Scaling laws hold on synthetic data, and staged training with synthetic RL shows strong performance gains.

Conclusion: High-quality synthetic data scaling and staged training can advance code reasoning while reducing reliance on real-world data. Synthetic approaches are viable for competitive programming tasks, with specific scaling dimensions being more effective than others.

Abstract: Competitive programming presents great challenges for Code LLMs due to its intensive reasoning demands and high logical complexity. However, current Code LLMs still rely heavily on real-world data, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we explore a fully synthetic approach: training Code LLMs with entirely generated tasks, solutions, and test cases, to empower code reasoning models without relying on real-world data. To support this, we leverage feature-based synthesis to propose a novel data synthesis pipeline called SynthSmith. SynthSmith shows strong potential in producing diverse and challenging tasks, along with verified solutions and tests, supporting both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Based on the proposed synthetic SFT and RL datasets, we introduce the X-Coder model series, which achieves a notable pass rate of 62.9 avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5 and 55.8 on v6, outperforming DeepCoder-14B-Preview and AReal-boba2-14B despite having only 7B parameters. In-depth analysis reveals that scaling laws hold on our synthetic dataset, and we explore which dimensions are more effective to scale. We further provide insights into code-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the key factors that shape performance through detailed ablations and analysis. Our findings demonstrate that scaling high-quality synthetic data and adopting staged training can greatly advance code reasoning, while mitigating reliance on real-world coding data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RealMem is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM memory systems in realistic, long-term project-oriented scenarios, featuring 2,000+ cross-session dialogues across 11 scenarios to test agents' ability to track evolving goals over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on casual conversation or task-oriented dialogue, but fail to capture "long-term project-oriented" interactions where autonomous agents must track evolving goals and maintain consistency over extended periods.

Method: Introduced RealMem benchmark with 2,000+ cross-session dialogues across 11 realistic project scenarios. Developed a synthesis pipeline with three components: Project Foundation Construction, Multi-Agent Dialogue Generation, and Memory and Schedule Management to simulate dynamic memory evolution.

Result: Experiments show current memory systems face significant challenges in managing long-term project states and dynamic context dependencies inherent in real-world projects.

Conclusion: RealMem addresses the gap in evaluating LLM memory for long-term project scenarios, revealing limitations of current systems and providing a benchmark for future development of more effective memory mechanisms for autonomous agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from static dialogue interfaces to autonomous general agents, effective memory is paramount to ensuring long-term consistency. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on casual conversation or task-oriented dialogue, failing to capture **"long-term project-oriented"** interactions where agents must track evolving goals.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce **RealMem**, the first benchmark grounded in realistic project scenarios. RealMem comprises over 2,000 cross-session dialogues across eleven scenarios, utilizing natural user queries for evaluation.
  We propose a synthesis pipeline that integrates Project Foundation Construction, Multi-Agent Dialogue Generation, and Memory and Schedule Management to simulate the dynamic evolution of memory. Experiments reveal that current memory systems face significant challenges in managing the long-term project states and dynamic context dependencies inherent in real-world projects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Architectural Fingerprinting to analyze how Transformers and Conformers process speech differently, finding Conformers categorize early while Transformers integrate late.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether Transformers and Conformers achieve comparable speech performance through similar processing strategies or different architectural biases, and to provide design guidance for speech applications.

Method: Architectural Fingerprinting framework that isolates architecture effects on representations, applied to 24 pre-trained encoders (39M-3.3B parameters) in a controlled experimental setup.

Result: Conformers implement "Categorize Early" strategy (phoneme categories resolved 29% earlier, speaker gender 16% earlier), while Transformers use "Integrate Late" strategy (deferring phoneme, accent, and duration encoding to deep layers at 49-57% depth).

Conclusion: Architectural fingerprints suggest design heuristics: Conformers' front-loaded categorization benefits low-latency streaming, while Transformers' deep integration favors tasks requiring rich context and cross-utterance normalization.

Abstract: In speech language modeling, two architectures dominate the frontier: the Transformer and the Conformer. However, it remains unknown whether their comparable performance stems from convergent processing strategies or distinct architectural inductive biases. We introduce Architectural Fingerprinting, a probing framework that isolates the effect of architecture on representation, and apply it to a controlled suite of 24 pre-trained encoders (39M-3.3B parameters). Our analysis reveals divergent hierarchies: Conformers implement a "Categorize Early" strategy, resolving phoneme categories 29% earlier in depth and speaker gender by 16% depth. In contrast, Transformers "Integrate Late," deferring phoneme, accent, and duration encoding to deep layers (49-57%). These fingerprints suggest design heuristics: Conformers' front-loaded categorization may benefit low-latency streaming, while Transformers' deep integration may favor tasks requiring rich context and cross-utterance normalization.

### [79] [LLMs Can't Play Hangman: On the Necessity of a Private Working Memory for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06973)
*Davide Baldelli,Ali Parviz,Amal Zouaq,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs lack private working memory, making them unable to reliably perform interactive tasks requiring hidden state maintenance while producing consistent public responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs evolve into autonomous agents, the standard chat interface's lack of private working memory limits their ability to handle interactive tasks that depend on hidden state, raising questions about their reliability in such scenarios.

Method: The paper defines Private State Interactive Tasks (PSITs), proves an impossibility theorem for agents without private memory, introduces a self-consistency testing protocol to evaluate agents across forked dialogue branches, and proposes a novel architecture with explicit private working memory.

Result: Standard chat-based LLMs and retrieval-based memory baselines fail the self-consistency test regardless of scale, demonstrating semantic retrieval cannot enable true state maintenance. The proposed private working memory architecture successfully restores consistency.

Conclusion: Private state maintenance is a necessary component for interactive language agents, and explicit private working memory is required to overcome the fundamental limitations of current chat-based LLM architectures.

Abstract: As LLMs move from text completion toward autonomous agents, they remain constrained by the standard chat interface, which lacks private working memory. This raises a fundamental question: can agents reliably perform interactive tasks that depend on hidden state? We define Private State Interactive Tasks (PSITs), which require agents to generate and maintain hidden information while producing consistent public responses. We show theoretically that any agent restricted to the public conversation history cannot simultaneously preserve secrecy and consistency in PSITs, yielding an impossibility theorem. To empirically validate this limitation, we introduce a self-consistency testing protocol that evaluates whether agents can maintain a hidden secret across forked dialogue branches. Standard chat-based LLMs and retrieval-based memory baselines fail this test regardless of scale, demonstrating that semantic retrieval does not enable true state maintenance. To address this, we propose a novel architecture incorporating an explicit private working memory; we demonstrate that this mechanism restores consistency, establishing private state as a necessary component for interactive language agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical QA systems struggle with complex medical data and multi-hop reasoning requirements, creating a need for models that can effectively handle both direct and sequential medical questions.

Method: The model processes sequential questions by decomposing them into chains of sub-questions for stepwise reasoning, while handling direct questions directly for efficiency. It uses multi-source information retrieval and in-context learning to provide rich context for answer generation.

Result: Achieved an Exact Match score of 0.84 on the BioCreative IX - MedHopQA Shared Task datasets, ranking second on the current leaderboard.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates strong capability in addressing biomedical QA challenges, offering a versatile solution that advances medical research and practice by effectively handling both direct and sequential medical queries.

Abstract: Biomedical Question Answering systems play a critical role in processing complex medical queries, yet they often struggle with the intricate nature of medical data and the demand for multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we propose a model designed to effectively address both direct and sequential questions. While sequential questions are decomposed into a chain of sub-questions to perform reasoning across a chain of steps, direct questions are processed directly to ensure efficiency and minimise processing overhead. Additionally, we leverage multi-source information retrieval and in-context learning to provide rich, relevant context for generating answers. We evaluated our model on the BioCreative IX - MedHopQA Shared Task datasets. Our approach achieves an Exact Match score of 0.84, ranking second on the current leaderboard. These results highlight the model's capability to meet the challenges of Biomedical Question Answering, offering a versatile solution for advancing medical research and practice.

TL;DR: MedTutor is an AI system that automatically generates evidence-based educational content and multiple-choice questions from clinical case reports to enhance medical resident training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical residents face challenges in interpreting complex case reports and quickly accessing reliable educational materials. Current methods of studying case reports and discussing with peers/mentors are time-consuming for finding relevant evidence-based resources.

Method: Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with hybrid retrieval from medical textbooks and academic literature (PubMed, Semantic Scholar APIs). Features evidence filtering/ordering with state-of-the-art reranking model, then LLM generates final educational content.

Result: Three radiologists assessed outputs as high clinical/educational value. Large-scale LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation showed moderate alignment between LLM and human expert judgments, indicating need for expert oversight.

Conclusion: MedTutor successfully augments resident training by generating evidence-based educational content from case reports, but expert oversight remains necessary despite promising LLM evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: The learning process for medical residents presents significant challenges, demanding both the ability to interpret complex case reports and the rapid acquisition of accurate medical knowledge from reliable sources. Residents typically study case reports and engage in discussions with peers and mentors, but finding relevant educational materials and evidence to support their learning from these cases is often time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we introduce MedTutor, a novel system designed to augment resident training by automatically generating evidence-based educational content and multiple-choice questions from clinical case reports. MedTutor leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that takes clinical case reports as input and produces targeted educational materials. The system's architecture features a hybrid retrieval mechanism that synergistically queries a local knowledge base of medical textbooks and academic literature (using PubMed, Semantic Scholar APIs) for the latest related research, ensuring the generated content is both foundationally sound and current. The retrieved evidence is filtered and ordered using a state-of-the-art reranking model and then an LLM generates the final long-form output describing the main educational content regarding the case-report. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of the system. First, three radiologists assessed the quality of outputs, finding them to be of high clinical and educational value. Second, we perform a large scale evaluation using an LLM-as-a Judge to understand if LLMs can be used to evaluate the output of the system. Our analysis using correlation between LLMs outputs and human expert judgments reveals a moderate alignment and highlights the continued necessity of expert oversight.

TL;DR: Adapting transformer-based constituency parser to low-resource Middle Dutch, showing joint training with related languages improves performance, and identifying domain adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most parsing advances focus on dependency parsing, while constituency parsing for low-resource historical languages like Middle Dutch receives little attention, despite its heterogeneity and resource scarcity.

Method: Adapt transformer-based constituency parser to Middle Dutch, use joint training with higher-resource auxiliary languages, evaluate strategies for leveraging new annotated data from additional domains, and explore feature-separation techniques for domain adaptation.

Result: Joint training with related languages increases F1 scores by up to 0.73, neural parser consistently outperforms PCFG-based parser, fine-tuning and data combination yield comparable improvements, and approximately 200 examples per domain needed for effective cross-domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Transformer-based constituency parsing can be effectively adapted to low-resource historical languages like Middle Dutch, with joint training with geographically/temporally closer languages providing the greatest benefits, and domain adaptation requiring sufficient per-domain examples.

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in applying neural networks and contextualized word embeddings to the parsing of historical languages. However, most advances have focused on dependency parsing, while constituency parsing for low-resource historical languages like Middle Dutch has received little attention. In this paper, we adapt a transformer-based constituency parser to Middle Dutch, a highly heterogeneous and low-resource language, and investigate methods to improve both its in-domain and cross-domain performance. We show that joint training with higher-resource auxiliary languages increases F1 scores by up to 0.73, with the greatest gains achieved from languages that are geographically and temporally closer to Middle Dutch. We further evaluate strategies for leveraging newly annotated data from additional domains, finding that fine-tuning and data combination yield comparable improvements, and our neural parser consistently outperforms the currently used PCFG-based parser for Middle Dutch. We further explore feature-separation techniques for domain adaptation and demonstrate that a minimum threshold of approximately 200 examples per domain is needed to effectively enhance cross-domain performance.

TL;DR: CFPG framework improves LLMs' ability to fulfill narrative foreshadowing-payoff structures by codifying them as executable causal predicates, addressing LLMs' failure to bridge long-range narrative dependencies.


<details>

Motivation: LLMs frequently fail to bridge long-range narrative dependencies, leaving "Chekhov's guns" unfired even when context is present. Existing evaluations overlook this structural failure, focusing on surface-level coherence rather than logical fulfillment of narrative setups.

Method: CFPG reframes narrative quality through payoff realization, transforming narrative continuity into executable causal predicates. It mines and encodes Foreshadow-Trigger-Payoff triples from BookSum corpus to provide structured supervision ensuring foreshadowed commitments are temporally and logically fulfilled.

Result: CFPG significantly outperforms standard prompting baselines in payoff accuracy and narrative alignment. The framework demonstrates improved ability to ensure foreshadowed commitments are properly resolved.

Conclusion: Explicitly codifying narrative mechanics is essential for moving LLMs from surface-level fluency to genuine narrative competence, addressing fundamental limitations in current story generation approaches.

Abstract: Foreshadowing and payoff are ubiquitous narrative devices through which authors introduce commitments early in a story and resolve them through concrete, observable outcomes. However, despite advances in story generation, large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to bridge these long-range narrative dependencies, often leaving "Chekhov's guns" unfired even when the necessary context is present. Existing evaluations largely overlook this structural failure, focusing on surface-level coherence rather than the logical fulfillment of narrative setups. In this paper, we introduce Codified Foreshadowing-Payoff Generation (CFPG), a novel framework that reframes narrative quality through the lens of payoff realization. Recognizing that LLMs struggle to intuitively grasp the "triggering mechanism" of a foreshadowed event, CFPG transforms narrative continuity into a set of executable causal predicates. By mining and encoding Foreshadow-Trigger-Payoff triples from the BookSum corpus, we provide structured supervision that ensures foreshadowed commitments are not only mentioned but also temporally and logically fulfilled. Experiments demonstrate that CFPG significantly outperforms standard prompting baselines in payoff accuracy and narrative alignment. Our findings suggest that explicitly codifying narrative mechanics is essential for moving LLMs from surface-level fluency to genuine narrative competence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that hybrid reasoning language models are controlled by specific trigger tokens rather than high-level instructions, identifies key triggers, and proposes Mid-Think prompting for better accuracy-length trade-off and RL training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hybrid reasoning models use high-level Think/No-think instructions to control reasoning behavior, but the authors discovered this mode switching is actually driven by specific trigger tokens rather than the instructions themselves, suggesting a more fundamental mechanism at play.

Method: Used attention analysis and controlled prompting experiments to identify trigger tokens, finding that a leading "Okay" token induces reasoning behavior while the newline pattern following "</think>" suppresses it. Proposed Mid-Think, a training-free prompting format that combines these triggers for intermediate-budget reasoning.

Result: Mid-Think consistently outperforms fixed-token and prompt-based baselines in accuracy-length trade-off. When applied to RL training after SFT, it reduces training time by ~15% while improving Qwen3-8B performance on AIME from 69.8% to 72.4% and on GPQA from 58.5% to 61.1%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that reasoning behavior in hybrid models is controlled by specific token-level triggers rather than high-level instructions, and the proposed Mid-Think format effectively leverages these triggers for both inference-time control and RL-based reasoning training, offering improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning language models are commonly controlled through high-level Think/No-think instructions to regulate reasoning behavior, yet we found that such mode switching is largely driven by a small set of trigger tokens rather than the instructions themselves. Through attention analysis and controlled prompting experiments, we show that a leading ``Okay'' token induces reasoning behavior, while the newline pattern following ``</think>'' suppresses it. Based on this observation, we propose Mid-Think, a simple training-free prompting format that combines these triggers to achieve intermediate-budget reasoning, consistently outperforming fixed-token and prompt-based baselines in terms of the accuracy-length trade-off. Furthermore, applying Mid-Think to RL training after SFT reduces training time by approximately 15% while improving final performance of Qwen3-8B on AIME from 69.8% to 72.4% and on GPQA from 58.5% to 61.1%, demonstrating its effectiveness for both inference-time control and RL-based reasoning training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Task vector merging improves ASR for low-resource languages by combining models from high-resource related languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need effective ASR for low-resource languages with limited training data, leveraging related high-resource languages.

Method: Treat language training as tasks, create task vectors via Whisper fine-tuning, merge via optimized linear combination on validation WER.

Result: Consistent performance improvements on target low-resource languages through task vector merging.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic approach effectively transfers knowledge from high-resource to low-resource languages for ASR.

Abstract: The development of resource-constrained approaches to automatic speech recognition (ASR) is of great interest due to its broad applicability to many low-resource languages for which there is scant usable data. Existing approaches to many low-resource natural language processing tasks leverage additional data from higher-resource languages that are closely related to a target low-resource language. One increasingly popular approach uses task arithmetic to combine models trained on different tasks to create a model for a task where there is little to no training data. In this paper, we consider training on a particular language to be a task, and we generate task vectors by fine-tuning variants of the Whisper ASR system. For pairings of high- and low-resource languages, we merge task vectors via a linear combination, optimizing the weights of the linear combination on the downstream word error rate on the low-resource target language's validation set. We find that this approach consistently improves performance on the target languages.

*Jiaqi Zhao,Qiang Huang,Haodong Chen,Xiaoxing You,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR is a framework for evaluating cross-lingual knowledge conflicts in multilingual LLMs, revealing task-dependent resolution patterns: reasoning tasks favor high-resource languages, while factual conflicts prioritize linguistic affinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have uneven knowledge distribution across languages, creating cross-lingual knowledge conflicts when external evidence contradicts language-dependent memories. This phenomenon is underexplored beyond English-centric settings, motivating systematic investigation of how multilingual LLMs resolve such conflicts.

Method: Introduces CLEAR framework that decomposes conflict resolution into four progressive scenarios: multilingual parametric elicitation to competitive multi-source cross-lingual induction. Evaluates six representative LLMs using multilingual versions of ConflictQA and ConflictingQA benchmarks covering 10 typologically diverse languages.

Result: Reveals task-dependent decision dichotomy: (1) Reasoning-intensive tasks: conflict resolution dominated by language resource abundance, with high-resource languages having stronger persuasive power. (2) Entity-centric factual conflicts: linguistic affinity becomes decisive, allowing low-resource but linguistically aligned languages to outperform distant high-resource ones.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual knowledge conflict resolution in multilingual LLMs follows distinct patterns based on task type, highlighting the complex interplay between language resources and linguistic relationships in model decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge across multiple languages, yet their internal beliefs are often unevenly distributed across linguistic spaces. When external evidence contradicts these language-dependent memories, models encounter \emph{cross-lingual knowledge conflict}, a phenomenon largely unexplored beyond English-centric settings. We introduce \textbf{CLEAR}, a \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{L}ingual knowl\textbf{E}dge conflict ev\textbf{A}luation f\textbf{R}amework that systematically examines how multilingual LLMs reconcile conflicting internal beliefs and multilingual external evidence. CLEAR decomposes conflict resolution into four progressive scenarios, from multilingual parametric elicitation to competitive multi-source cross-lingual induction, and systematically evaluates model behavior across two complementary QA benchmarks with distinct task characteristics. We construct multilingual versions of ConflictQA and ConflictingQA covering 10 typologically diverse languages and evaluate six representative LLMs. Our experiments reveal a task-dependent decision dichotomy. In reasoning-intensive tasks, conflict resolution is dominated by language resource abundance, with high-resource languages exerting stronger persuasive power. In contrast, for entity-centric factual conflicts, linguistic affinity, not resource scale, becomes decisive, allowing low-resource but linguistically aligned languages to outperform distant high-resource ones.

*Tim Fingscheidt,Patrick Blumenberg,Björn Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that hallucination in generative AI might be a feature rather than a bug, and explores probability engineering techniques to control and leverage limited hallucination for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of generative AI models like ChatGPT and GAIA-1 reveals they only function satisfactorily when allowed some degree of hallucination, challenging the conventional negative view of hallucination in AI systems.

Method: The paper recapitulates simple probability engineering techniques that can be used to encourage generative AI to hallucinate to a limited extent, providing controlled mechanisms to achieve desired outcomes.

Result: The analysis suggests that controlled hallucination may be essential for generative AI to produce satisfactory results, positioning it as a potential feature rather than a bug in AI systems.

Conclusion: Hallucination in generative AI is likely not a bug but rather a feature that can be engineered and controlled through probability techniques to enhance AI performance and achieve desired outcomes.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is conquering our lives at lightning speed. Large language models such as ChatGPT answer our questions or write texts for us, large computer vision models such as GAIA-1 generate videos on the basis of text descriptions or continue prompted videos. These neural network models are trained using large amounts of text or video data, strictly according to the real data employed in training. However, there is a surprising observation: When we use these models, they only function satisfactorily when they are allowed a certain degree of fantasy (hallucination). While hallucination usually has a negative connotation in generative AI - after all, ChatGPT is expected to give a fact-based answer! - this article recapitulates some simple means of probability engineering that can be used to encourage generative AI to hallucinate to a limited extent and thus lead to the desired results. We have to ask ourselves: Is hallucination in gen-erative AI probably not a bug, but rather a feature?

*Zhuoyi Yang,Yurun Song,Iftekhar Ahmed,Ian Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of knowledge injection methods (unsupervised fine-tuning, supervised fine-tuning, and RAG) for multi-hop QA shows RAG excels with temporally novel knowledge, while supervised fine-tuning achieves highest overall accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The relative effectiveness of different knowledge injection methods (finetuning vs RAG) for multi-hop question answering remains insufficiently understood, especially when dealing with temporally novel knowledge beyond models' pretraining cutoff.

Method: Systematically compare parametric (unsupervised fine-tuning/continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning) and non-parametric (retrieval-augmented generation) knowledge injection methods across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs on two benchmarks: QASC and a new dataset of 10,000+ multi-hop questions from 2024 Wikipedia events.

Result: Unsupervised fine-tuning provides limited gains; RAG yields substantial improvements especially for temporally novel information; supervised fine-tuning achieves highest overall accuracy across models and datasets.

Conclusion: Different knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop QA in fundamentally different ways, with retrieval-based methods being particularly important when external or compositional knowledge is required.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering is widely used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it requires integrating multiple pieces of supporting knowledge to arrive at a correct answer. While prior work has explored different mechanisms for providing knowledge to LLMs, such as finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), their relative effectiveness for multi-hop question answering remains insufficiently understood, particularly when the required knowledge is temporally novel.
  In this paper, we systematically compare parametric and non-parametric knowledge injection methods for open-domain multi-hop question answering. We evaluate unsupervised fine-tuning (continual pretraining), supervised fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: QASC, a standard multi-hop science question answering dataset, and a newly constructed dataset of over 10,000 multi-hop questions derived from Wikipedia events in 2024, designed to test knowledge beyond the models' pretraining cutoff.
  Our results show that unsupervised fine-tuning provides only limited gains over base models, suggesting that continual pretraining alone is insufficient for improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial and consistent improvements, particularly when answering questions that rely on temporally novel information. Supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall accuracy across models and datasets. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop question answering and underscore the importance of retrieval-based methods when external or compositional knowledge is required.

*Pranav Narayanan Venkit,Yu Li,Yada Pruksachatkun,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOPE framework improves LLM persona creation using detailed sociopsychological data instead of just demographics, reducing bias and improving behavioral prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic personas for LLMs rely too heavily on coarse sociodemographic attributes or summaries, which are insufficient for accurate social simulation and behavioral prediction.

Method: Developed SCOPE framework using 141-item, two-hour sociopsychological protocol from 124 U.S. participants. Tested across 7 models, compared demographic-only vs. sociopsychological personas, and evaluated on SimBench with 441 aligned questions.

Result: Demographic-only personas explain only ~1.5% of variance in human response similarity. Adding sociopsychological facets improves behavioral prediction, reduces over-accentuation, and non-demographic personas based on values/identity achieve strong alignment with lower bias. SCOPE outperforms default prompting and NVIDIA Nemotron personas.

Conclusion: Persona quality depends on sociopsychological structure rather than demographic templates or summaries. Detailed psychological protocols produce more accurate, less biased personas for social simulation.

Abstract: Synthetic personas are widely used to condition large language models (LLMs) for social simulation, yet most personas are still constructed from coarse sociodemographic attributes or summaries. We revisit persona creation by introducing SCOPE, a socially grounded framework for persona construction and evaluation, built from a 141-item, two-hour sociopsychological protocol collected from 124 U.S.-based participants. Across seven models, we find that demographic-only personas are a structural bottleneck: demographics explain only ~1.5% of variance in human response similarity. Adding sociopsychological facets improves behavioral prediction and reduces over-accentuation, and non-demographic personas based on values and identity achieve strong alignment with substantially lower bias. These trends generalize to SimBench (441 aligned questions), where SCOPE personas outperform default prompting and NVIDIA Nemotron personas, and SCOPE augmentation improves Nemotron-based personas. Our results indicate that persona quality depends on sociopsychological structure rather than demographic templates or summaries.

*Makoto Sato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReMIND is a REM-inspired modular framework for LLM-based creative ideation that separates exploration and consolidation through four stages (wake, dream, judge, re-wake) to generate novel yet coherent ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches struggle to elicit serendipitous insights that are both novel and internally coherent. Stochastic sampling promotes novelty but often degrades consistency, creating a trade-off between exploration and stability in creative ideation.

Method: ReMIND uses a four-stage modular framework: 1) Wake - generates stable low-temperature semantic baseline; 2) Dream - performs high-temperature exploratory generation; 3) Judge - applies coarse evaluation to filter incoherent outputs and extract candidate ideas; 4) Re-wake - re-articulates selected ideas into coherent final outputs. Each stage is instantiated as an independent LLM for functional separation.

Result: Parameter sweeps show ReMIND reliably induces semantic exploration while preserving downstream stability. Embedding analyses confirm substantial semantic displacement during dream phase. External evaluations reveal high-quality ideas emerge sporadically as rare events rather than as extrema along single metrics.

Conclusion: Serendipitous ideation in LLMs is a rare-event process best approached through system-level design that shapes conditions for valuable ideas to emerge and be stabilized. ReMIND provides a general framework for studying computational basis of serendipity and illustrates how modular LLM orchestration can bridge exploration and stabilization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used not only for problem solving but also for creative ideation; however, eliciting serendipitous insights that are both novel and internally coherent remains difficult. While stochastic sampling promotes novelty, it often degrades consistency. Here, we propose ReMIND, a REM-inspired modular framework for ideation. ReMIND consists of four stages: wake, which generates a stable low-temperature semantic baseline; dream, which performs high-temperature exploratory generation; judge, which applies coarse evaluation to filter incoherent outputs and extract candidate ideas; and re-wake, which re-articulates selected ideas into coherent final outputs. By instantiating each stage as an independent LLM, ReMIND enables functional separation between exploration and consolidation. Parameter sweeps show that ReMIND reliably induces semantic exploration while preserving downstream stability. Embedding-based analyses confirm substantial semantic displacement during the dream phase, whereas external evaluations reveal that high-quality ideas emerge sporadically rather than as extrema along any single metric. These results suggest that serendipitous ideation in LLMs is a rare-event process best approached through system level design that shapes the conditions under which valuable ideas can emerge and be stabilized. ReMIND provides a general framework for studying the computational basis of serendipity and illustrates how modular LLM orchestration can bridge exploration and stabilization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TimePuzzles is a constraint-based date inference task for evaluating iterative temporal reasoning in LLMs, where models must solve puzzles combining temporal anchors and calendar relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating iterative temporal reasoning capabilities in LLMs, particularly for tool-augmented reasoning, as existing benchmarks may not adequately test these skills.

Method: Algorithmically generated puzzles combining factual temporal anchors with cross-cultural calendar relations, each admitting one or multiple valid solution dates. Evaluated 13 diverse LLMs with and without tools (web search, code interpreter).

Result: TimePuzzles effectively distinguishes iterative temporal reasoning capabilities: GPT-5 reaches only 49.3% accuracy, all other models below 31%. Web search yields substantial gains, code interpreter shows mixed effects. Models perform much better when constraints are rewritten with explicit dates.

Conclusion: TimePuzzles provides a simple, cost-effective diagnostic for tool-augmented iterative temporal reasoning, revealing gaps in reliable tool use and highlighting the challenge of temporal reasoning even for state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We introduce TimePuzzles, a constraint-based date inference task for evaluating iterative temporal reasoning. Each puzzle combines factual temporal anchors with (cross-cultural) calendar relations, admits one or multiple valid solution dates, and is algorithmically generated for controlled, dynamic, and continual evaluation. Across 13 diverse LLMs, TimePuzzles well distinguishes their iterative temporal reasoning capabilities and remains challenging without tools: GPT-5 reaches only 49.3% accuracy and all other models stay below 31%, despite the dataset's simplicity. Web search consistently yields substantial gains and using code interpreter shows mixed effects, but all models perform much better when constraints are rewritten with explicit dates, revealing a gap in reliable tool use. Overall, TimePuzzles presents a simple, cost-effective diagnostic for tool-augmented iterative temporal reasoning.

Motivation: Code-switching is common in multilingual communication, but LLM robustness in mixed-language settings is poorly understood, necessitating comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Created CodeMixQA benchmark with high-quality human annotations covering 16 diverse parallel code-switched language-pair variants across regions, including original scripts and transliterations. Analyzed LLM reasoning behavior on code-switched QA tasks and systematically evaluated LLM-generated synthetic code-switched text for naturalness and semantic fidelity.

Result: Revealed persistent challenges in both reasoning and generation under code-switching conditions, uncovering key limitations in current LLM capabilities for processing mixed-language inputs.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for building more robust multilingual LLMs and releases the dataset and code as open source to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Code-switching is a pervasive phenomenon in multilingual communication, yet the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in mixed-language settings remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of LLM capabilities in understanding, reasoning over, and generating code-switched text. We introduce CodeMixQA a novel benchmark with high-quality human annotations, comprising 16 diverse parallel code-switched language-pair variants that span multiple geographic regions and code-switching patterns, and include both original scripts and their transliterated forms. Using this benchmark, we analyze the reasoning behavior of LLMs on code-switched question-answering tasks, shedding light on how models process and reason over mixed-language inputs. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of LLM-generated synthetic code-switched text, focusing on both naturalness and semantic fidelity, and uncover key limitations in current generation capabilities. Our findings reveal persistent challenges in both reasoning and generation under code-switching conditions and provide actionable insights for building more robust multilingual LLMs. We release the dataset and code as open source.

TL;DR: SCR framework improves LLM reasoning efficiency by structuring reasoning into explicit components (Generate-Verify-Revise) with targeted training, reducing output tokens by up to 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate long, redundant reasoning chains with unnecessary verification and revisions even after reaching correct answers, due to unstructured reasoning trajectories and lack of targeted supervision for critical reasoning abilities.

Method: Proposes Structured Reasoning (SCR) framework that decouples reasoning into explicit, evaluable components using Generate-Verify-Revise paradigm. Uses structured training data with Dynamic Termination Supervision to decide when to stop reasoning. Employs progressive two-stage RL: first stage for initial generation and self-verification, second stage for revision.

Result: SCR substantially improves reasoning efficiency and self-verification across three backbone models. Reduces output token length by up to 50% compared to existing reasoning paradigms.

Conclusion: SCR provides an effective framework for structured reasoning in LLMs, addressing redundancy in reasoning chains through explicit component decomposition and targeted training, leading to significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance by generating long chains of thought, but longer traces always introduce redundant or ineffective reasoning steps. One typical behavior is that they often perform unnecessary verification and revisions even if they have reached the correct answers. This limitation stems from the unstructured nature of reasoning trajectories and the lack of targeted supervision for critical reasoning abilities. To address this, we propose Structured Reasoning (SCR), a framework that decouples reasoning trajectories into explicit, evaluable, and trainable components. We mainly implement SCR using a Generate-Verify-Revise paradigm. Specifically, we construct structured training data and apply Dynamic Termination Supervision to guide the model in deciding when to terminate reasoning. To avoid interference between learning signals for different reasoning abilities, we adopt a progressive two-stage reinforcement learning strategy: the first stage targets initial generation and self-verification, and the second stage focuses on revision. Extensive experiments on three backbone models show that SCR substantially improves reasoning efficiency and self-verification. Besides, compared with existing reasoning paradigms, it reduces output token length by up to 50%.

*Manzong Huang,Chenyang Bu,Yi He,Xingrui Zhuo,Xindong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Relink introduces a "reason-and-construct" paradigm for GraphRAG that dynamically builds query-specific evidence graphs instead of using static knowledge graphs, addressing incompleteness and noise issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GraphRAG methods use a "build-then-reason" paradigm with static knowledge graphs that suffer from two critical problems: (1) inherent incompleteness that breaks reasoning paths, and (2) low signal-to-noise ratio with distractor facts that mislead reasoning.

Method: Relink employs a "reason-and-construct" paradigm that dynamically builds query-specific evidence graphs. It addresses incompleteness by instantiating required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. For handling distractor facts, it uses a unified query-aware evaluation strategy that jointly considers candidates from both the KG and latent relations, selecting the most useful facts for answering each query.

Result: Extensive experiments on five Open-Domain Question Answering benchmarks show Relink achieves significant improvements of 5.4% in EM and 5.2% in F1 over leading GraphRAG baselines.

Conclusion: Relink's dynamic "reason-and-construct" paradigm effectively addresses the limitations of static knowledge graphs in GraphRAG, demonstrating superior performance by actively constructing faithful and precise evidence paths for each query.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) mitigates hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding them in structured knowledge. However, current GraphRAG methods are constrained by a prevailing \textit{build-then-reason} paradigm, which relies on a static, pre-constructed Knowledge Graph (KG). This paradigm faces two critical challenges. First, the KG's inherent incompleteness often breaks reasoning paths. Second, the graph's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces distractor facts, presenting query-relevant but misleading knowledge that disrupts the reasoning process.
  To address these challenges, we argue for a \textit{reason-and-construct} paradigm and propose Relink, a framework that dynamically builds a query-specific evidence graph. To tackle incompleteness, \textbf{Relink} instantiates required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the original text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. To handle misleading or distractor facts, Relink employs a unified, query-aware evaluation strategy that jointly considers candidates from both the KG and latent relations, selecting those most useful for answering the query rather than relying on their pre-existence. This empowers Relink to actively discard distractor facts and construct the most faithful and precise evidence path for each query.
  Extensive experiments on five Open-Domain Question Answering benchmarks show that Relink achieves significant average improvements of 5.4\% in EM and 5.2\% in F1 over leading GraphRAG baselines, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: MI-PRUN: A mutual information-based block pruning method for LLMs that uses hidden state transitions and Data Processing Inequality to identify redundant blocks, achieving globally optimal solutions with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require substantial computational and memory resources, creating a need for efficient compression methods. Existing block pruning approaches are unstable and struggle to find globally optimal solutions, motivating a more stable and effective pruning method.

Method: Proposes MI-PRUN: 1) Uses mutual information to identify redundant blocks by evaluating hidden state transitions, 2) Incorporates Data Processing Inequality to reveal relationships between entire contiguous blocks and individual blocks, 3) Develops Fast-Block-Select algorithm for iterative block combination updates to achieve globally optimal solutions efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the method, achieving significant compression and inference acceleration while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: MI-PRUN provides a stable and effective block pruning approach for LLMs that overcomes limitations of existing methods, achieving globally optimal solutions with improved efficiency for model compression and acceleration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable across various domains, but this comes at the cost of substantial computational and memory resources. Model pruning addresses this by removing redundant components from models. In particular, block pruning can achieve significant compression and inference acceleration. However, existing block pruning methods are often unstable and struggle to attain globally optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a mutual information based pruning method MI-PRUN for LLMs. Specifically, we leverages mutual information to identify redundant blocks by evaluating transitions in hidden states. Additionally, we incorporate the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to reveal the relationship between the importance of entire contiguous blocks and that of individual blocks. Moreover, we develop the Fast-Block-Select algorithm, which iteratively updates block combinations to achieve a globally optimal solution while significantly improving the efficiency. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of our method.

*Chen Shani,Yuval Reif,Nathan Roll,Dan Jurafsky,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey paper examines why multilingual language models show uneven performance across languages, finding that gaps often stem from modeling choices rather than inherent linguistic difficulty, and provides design recommendations for more balanced multilingual LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual language models promise broader NLP access but deliver uneven performance across different languages. The paper aims to understand whether these performance gaps reflect intrinsic linguistic difficulty or are artifacts of modeling choices.

Method: The survey organizes literature around two key questions: 1) whether linguistic disparities arise from representation and allocation choices (tokenization, encoding, data exposure, parameter sharing) rather than inherent complexity, and 2) which design choices mitigate inequities across typologically diverse languages. The authors review linguistic features (orthography, morphology, lexical diversity, syntax, information density, typological distance) and link each to concrete modeling mechanisms.

Result: The analysis reveals that performance gaps often shrink when segmentation, encoding, and data exposure are normalized, suggesting that much apparent difficulty stems from current modeling choices rather than inherent linguistic complexity.

Conclusion: The paper synthesizes insights into design recommendations for tokenization, sampling, architectures, and evaluation to support more balanced multilingual language models that provide more equitable performance across diverse languages.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) promise broader NLP access, yet current systems deliver uneven performance across the world's languages. This survey examines why these gaps persist and whether they reflect intrinsic linguistic difficulty or modeling artifacts.

We review linguistic features, such as orthography, morphology, lexical diversity, syntax, information density, and typological distance, linking each to concrete modeling mechanisms. Gaps often shrink when segmentation, encoding, and data exposure are normalized, suggesting much apparent difficulty stems from current modeling choices. We synthesize these insights into design recommendations for tokenization, sampling, architectures, and evaluation to support more balanced multilingual LMs.

Motivation: Multi-round RAG methods using LLM-generated queries suffer from knowledge overshadowing, where critical information gets overshadowed during generation, leading to incomplete/inaccurate queries, irrelevant retrieval, and error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning.

Method: ActiShade iteratively: 1) detects overshadowed keyphrases in queries, 2) retrieves documents relevant to both query and overshadowed keyphrase, 3) generates new queries based on retrieved documents to guide next-round iteration, supplementing overshadowed knowledge while minimizing irrelevant noise.

Result: Extensive experiments show ActiShade outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: ActiShade effectively reduces error accumulation caused by knowledge overshadowing in multi-hop reasoning by activating overshadowed knowledge during query formulation.

Abstract: In multi-hop reasoning, multi-round retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically rely on LLM-generated content as the retrieval query. However, these approaches are inherently vulnerable to knowledge overshadowing - a phenomenon where critical information is overshadowed during generation. As a result, the LLM-generated content may be incomplete or inaccurate, leading to irrelevant retrieval and causing error accumulation during the iteration process. To address this challenge, we propose ActiShade, which detects and activates overshadowed knowledge to guide large language models (LLMs) in multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, ActiShade iteratively detects the overshadowed keyphrase in the given query, retrieves documents relevant to both the query and the overshadowed keyphrase, and generates a new query based on the retrieved documents to guide the next-round iteration. By supplementing the overshadowed knowledge during the formulation of next-round queries while minimizing the introduction of irrelevant noise, ActiShade reduces the error accumulation caused by knowledge overshadowing. Extensive experiments show that ActiShade outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and LLMs.

*Weihao Xuan,Qingcheng Zeng,Heli Qi,Yunze Xiao,Junjue Wang,Naoto Yokoya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based autonomous agents using tools show systematic calibration issues: evidence tools (like web search) cause overconfidence due to noisy information, while verification tools (like code interpreters) improve calibration. The paper proposes RL fine-tuning to jointly optimize accuracy and calibration, showing agents can generalize across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthiness of LLM-based autonomous agents is critical for real-world deployment. While calibration (matching confidence to actual performance) is well-studied for static models, it remains underexplored in tool-integrated agentic workflows where agents use external tools to complete tasks.

Method: Systematic investigation of verbalized calibration in tool-use agents, identifying a confidence dichotomy based on tool type. Proposes a reinforcement learning fine-tuning framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and calibration, supported by a benchmark of reward designs. Evaluates generalization from training environments to noisy web settings and different domains.

Result: Evidence tools (e.g., web search) systematically induce severe overconfidence due to noise in retrieved information. Verification tools (e.g., code interpreters) can ground reasoning through deterministic feedback and mitigate miscalibration. RL-trained agents achieve superior calibration and robust generalization across domains including mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Domain-specific calibration strategies are necessary for tool-use agents. The work establishes a foundation for building self-aware agents that can reliably communicate uncertainty, which is crucial for high-stakes, real-world deployments of autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving to handle multi-turn tasks, but ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge. A fundamental pillar of this trustworthiness is calibration, which refers to an agent's ability to express confidence that reliably reflects its actual performance. While calibration is well-established for static models, its dynamics in tool-integrated agentic workflows remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate verbalized calibration in tool-use agents, revealing a fundamental confidence dichotomy driven by tool type. Specifically, our pilot study identifies that evidence tools (e.g., web search) systematically induce severe overconfidence due to inherent noise in retrieved information, while verification tools (e.g., code interpreters) can ground reasoning through deterministic feedback and mitigate miscalibration. To robustly improve calibration across tool types, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and calibration, supported by a holistic benchmark of reward designs. We demonstrate that our trained agents not only achieve superior calibration but also exhibit robust generalization from local training environments to noisy web settings and to distinct domains such as mathematical reasoning. Our results highlight the necessity of domain-specific calibration strategies for tool-use agents. More broadly, this work establishes a foundation for building self-aware agents that can reliably communicate uncertainty in high-stakes, real-world deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocZSRE-SI improves zero-shot relation extraction for low-resource languages by using entity side information instead of LLM-generated synthetic data, achieving 11.6% F1-score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DocZSRE approaches rely on LLMs to generate synthetic data for unseen relations, which is problematic for low-resource languages like Malaysian English due to linguistic nuances and factual inaccuracies in LLM outputs.

Method: Proposes DocZSRE-SI framework that leverages Entity Side Information (Entity Mention Descriptions and Entity Mention Hypernyms) instead of LLM-generated synthetic data, creating a low-complexity model for zero-shot relation extraction.

Result: Achieves average 11.6% improvement in macro F1-Score compared to baseline models and existing benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness for low-resource languages like Malaysian English.

Conclusion: DocZSRE-SI provides a robust, efficient alternative to error-prone LLM-based methods, offering scalable and reliable zero-shot relation extraction particularly for low-resource languages and linguistically diverse contexts.

Abstract: Document-Level Zero-Shot Relation Extraction (DocZSRE) aims to predict unseen relation labels in text documents without prior training on specific relations. Existing approaches rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data for unseen labels, which poses challenges for low-resource languages like Malaysian English. These challenges include the incorporation of local linguistic nuances and the risk of factual inaccuracies in LLM-generated data. This paper introduces Document-Level Zero-Shot Relation Extraction with Entity Side Information (DocZSRE-SI) to address limitations in the existing DocZSRE approach. The DocZSRE-SI framework leverages Entity Side Information, such as Entity Mention Descriptions and Entity Mention Hypernyms, to perform ZSRE without depending on LLM-generated synthetic data. The proposed low-complexity model achieves an average improvement of 11.6% in the macro F1-Score compared to baseline models and existing benchmarks. By utilizing Entity Side Information, DocZSRE-SI offers a robust and efficient alternative to error-prone, LLM-based methods, demonstrating significant advancements in handling low-resource languages and linguistic diversity in relation extraction tasks. This research provides a scalable and reliable solution for ZSRE, particularly in contexts like Malaysian English news articles, where traditional LLM-based approaches fall short.

*Kalvin Chang,Yiwen Shao,Jiahong Li,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the technology gap for Chinese dialects by creating cross-dialect semantically aligned speech representations using ASR-only data, enabling dialect-to-Mandarin speech-LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese dialects have hundreds of millions of speakers but lag behind Mandarin in speech and language technologies. Since most varieties are primarily spoken, dialect-to-Mandarin speech-LLMs are more practical than dialect-only LLMs, requiring cross-dialect semantic alignment between dialects and Mandarin.

Method: Train a speech encoder using only ASR (automatic speech recognition) data to achieve cross-dialect semantic alignment between Chinese dialects and Mandarin. The approach is validated through speech-to-speech retrieval on a new benchmark of spoken Chinese varieties that the authors contribute.

Result: The speech encoder demonstrates cross-dialect semantic alignment as shown by speech-to-speech retrieval performance on the new benchmark. It also achieves state-of-the-art ASR performance on Chinese dialects. The benchmark, aligned representations, and evaluation framework lay groundwork for future Chinese dialect speech-LLMs.

Conclusion: The work provides essential components for advancing Chinese dialect speech technologies: a benchmark dataset, semantically aligned speech representations, and speech-to-speech retrieval evaluation, enabling practical dialect-to-Mandarin speech-LLMs for hundreds of millions of speakers.

Abstract: Despite having hundreds of millions of speakers, Chinese dialects lag behind Mandarin in speech and language technologies. Most varieties are primarily spoken, making dialect-to-Mandarin speech-LLMs (large language models) more practical than dialect LLMs. Building dialect-to-Mandarin speech-LLMs requires speech representations with cross-dialect semantic alignment between Chinese dialects and Mandarin. In this paper, we achieve such a cross-dialect semantic alignment by training a speech encoder with ASR (automatic speech recognition)-only data, as demonstrated by speech-to-speech retrieval on a new benchmark of spoken Chinese varieties that we contribute. Our speech encoder further demonstrates state-of-the-art ASR performance on Chinese dialects. Together, our Chinese dialect benchmark, semantically aligned speech representations, and speech-to-speech retrieval evaluation lay the groundwork for future Chinese dialect speech-LLMs. We release the benchmark at https://github.com/kalvinchang/yubao.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TableQA benchmarks overlook industrial complexities like multi-table structures, nested headers, and massive scales, which require deep structured inference not adequately addressed by current methods.

Method: 1) Created ReasonTabQA benchmark with 1,932 tables across 30 industry domains, providing annotations for answers and reasoning chains. 2) Developed TabCodeRL, a reinforcement learning method using table-aware verifiable rewards to guide logical reasoning path generation.

Result: TabCodeRL yields substantial performance gains on open-source LLMs across ReasonTabQA and 4 TableQA datasets, but a persistent performance gap on ReasonTabQA highlights the inherent complexity of real-world industrial TableQA.

Conclusion: Industrial TableQA presents significant challenges due to complex table structures, and while TabCodeRL improves performance, the gap on ReasonTabQA demonstrates the need for continued advancement in handling real-world industrial table reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly catalyzed table-based question answering (TableQA). However, existing TableQA benchmarks often overlook the intricacies of industrial scenarios, which are characterized by multi-table structures, nested headers, and massive scales. These environments demand robust table reasoning through deep structured inference, presenting a significant challenge that remains inadequately addressed by current methodologies. To bridge this gap, we present ReasonTabQA, a large-scale bilingual benchmark encompassing 1,932 tables across 30 industry domains such as energy and automotive. ReasonTabQA provides high-quality annotations for both final answers and explicit reasoning chains, supporting both thinking and no-thinking paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce TabCodeRL, a reinforcement learning method that leverages table-aware verifiable rewards to guide the generation of logical reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on ReasonTabQA and 4 TableQA datasets demonstrate that while TabCodeRL yields substantial performance gains on open-source LLMs, the persistent performance gap on ReasonTabQA underscores the inherent complexity of real-world industrial TableQA.

TL;DR: PsyCLIENT is a novel LLM-based client simulation framework using conversational trajectory modeling to create realistic counseling clients, with a focus on Chinese-language settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing client simulation approaches have three key limitations: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) lack of principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) scarcity in Chinese-language settings for mental health counseling simulations.

Method: Proposed PsyCLIENT framework uses conversational trajectory modeling by conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories with explicit behavior labels and content constraints. Also introduced PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset covering 60 distinct counseling topics.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations by licensed professional counselors show PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in authenticity and training effectiveness. Simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving about 95% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks.

Conclusion: Conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: LLM-based client simulation has emerged as a promising tool for training novice counselors and evaluating automated counseling systems. However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Mitrasamgraha, a large Sanskrit-to-English MT dataset (391k pairs) covering 3+ millennia and diverse domains, enabling study of temporal/domain effects on translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sanskrit literature presents unique challenges (poetic language, philosophy, metaphors, sandhi, compounding, morphology) that make MT difficult, and there's a lack of publicly available resources covering its diverse domains and temporal layers.

Method: Created Mitrasamgraha dataset with 391,548 Sanskrit-English bitext pairs spanning 3+ millennia and various domains; includes validation (5,587) and test (5,552) sets with post-correction; benchmarked commercial/open models and fine-tuned NLLB and Gemma models.

Result: Dataset is 4x larger than previous largest Sanskrit dataset; fine-tuning shows significant improvements but challenges remain for complex compounds, philosophical concepts, and multi-layered metaphors; analyzed in-context learning effects on commercial models.

Conclusion: Mitrasamgraha addresses the resource gap for Sanskrit MT, enabling fine-grained study of domain/time effects and providing a benchmark for improving translation of challenging Sanskrit literature.

Abstract: While machine translation is regarded as a "solved problem" for many high-resource languages, close analysis quickly reveals that this is not the case for content that shows challenges such as poetic language, philosophical concepts, multi-layered metaphorical expressions, and more. Sanskrit literature is a prime example of this, as it combines a large number of such challenges in addition to inherent linguistic features like sandhi, compounding, and heavy morphology, which further complicate NLP downstream tasks. It spans multiple millennia of text production time as well as a large breadth of different domains, ranging from ritual formulas via epic narratives, philosophical treatises, poetic verses up to scientific material. As of now, there is a strong lack of publicly available resources that cover these different domains and temporal layers of Sanskrit. We therefore introduce Mitrasamgraha, a high-quality Sanskrit-to-English machine translation dataset consisting of 391,548 bitext pairs, more than four times larger than the largest previously available Sanskrit dataset Itih=asa. It covers a time period of more than three millennia and a broad range of historical Sanskrit domains. In contrast to web-crawled datasets, the temporal and domain annotation of this dataset enables fine-grained study of domain and time period effects on MT performance. We also release a validation set consisting of 5,587 and a test set consisting of 5,552 post-corrected bitext pairs. We conduct experiments benchmarking commercial and open models on this dataset and fine-tune NLLB and Gemma models on the dataset, showing significant improvements, while still recognizing significant challenges in the translation of complex compounds, philosophical concepts, and multi-layered metaphors. We also analyze how in-context learning on this dataset impacts the performance of commercial models

TL;DR: A tutorial paper presenting a workflow for building semantic networks from creative texts, comparing word co-occurrence networks vs textual forma mentis networks (TFMNs), and using them to predict human creativity ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide practical guidance for researchers applying network-based methods in cognitive fields like creativity research, offering both accessible workflows for newcomers and deeper methodological insights for experienced researchers.

Method: Step-by-step workflow using 1029 short stories: text preprocessing, network construction (co-occurrence networks vs TFMNs), feature extraction (structural measures, spreading-activation indices, emotion scores), and regression modeling to predict creativity ratings.

Result: TFMNs consistently outperformed co-occurrence networks with lower prediction errors (best MAE = 0.581 vs 0.592). Network-structural features were most predictive (MAE = 0.591), emotion features performed worse (MAE = 0.711), and spreading-activation measures contributed little (MAE = 0.788).

Conclusion: The paper provides a reproducible workflow showing when syntactic networks (TFMNs) are preferable to surface co-occurrence models, offering practical guidance for network-based creativity research with demonstrated superiority of TFMNs in predictive performance.

Abstract: This tutorial paper provides a step-by-step workflow for building and analysing semantic networks from short creative texts. We introduce and compare two widely used text-to-network approaches: word co-occurrence networks and textual forma mentis networks (TFMNs). We also demonstrate how they can be used in machine learning to predict human creativity ratings. Using a corpus of 1029 short stories, we guide readers through text preprocessing, network construction, feature extraction (structural measures, spreading-activation indices, and emotion scores), and application of regression models. We evaluate how network-construction choices influence both network topology and predictive performance. Across all modelling settings, TFMNs consistently outperformed co-occurrence networks through lower prediction errors (best MAE = 0.581 for TFMN, vs 0.592 for co-occurrence with window size 3). Network-structural features dominated predictive performance (MAE = 0.591 for TFMN), whereas emotion features performed worse (MAE = 0.711 for TFMN) and spreading-activation measures contributed little (MAE = 0.788 for TFMN). This paper offers practical guidance for researchers interested in applying network-based methods for cognitive fields like creativity research. we show when syntactic networks are preferable to surface co-occurrence models, and provide an open, reproducible workflow accessible to newcomers in the field, while also offering deeper methodological insight for experienced researchers.

TL;DR: BayesRAG: A novel multimodal retrieval framework using Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer theory to fuse evidence from text and images, improving RAG performance on visually rich documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG approaches struggle with visually rich documents by treating text and images as isolated retrieval targets, and cosine similarity methods fail to capture cross-modal semantic reinforcement and layout-induced coherence.

Method: BayesRAG models intrinsic consistency of retrieved candidates across modalities as probabilistic evidence using Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer theory. It computes posterior association probability for multimodal retrieval combinations, prioritizing text-image pairs that mutually corroborate in semantics and layout.

Result: Extensive experiments show BayesRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging multimodal benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval fusion.

Conclusion: BayesRAG effectively resolves the isolation of heterogeneous modalities through evidence fusion and enhances retrieval robustness, providing a novel framework for multimodal RAG.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a pivotal paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current approaches struggle with visually rich documents by treating text and images as isolated retrieval targets. Existing methods relying solely on cosine similarity often fail to capture the semantic reinforcement provided by cross-modal alignment and layout-induced coherence. To address these limitations, we propose BayesRAG, a novel multimodal retrieval framework grounded in Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Unlike traditional approaches that rank candidates strictly by similarity, BayesRAG models the intrinsic consistency of retrieved candidates across modalities as probabilistic evidence to refine retrieval confidence. Specifically, our method computes the posterior association probability for combinations of multimodal retrieval results, prioritizing text-image pairs that mutually corroborate each other in terms of both semantics and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BayesRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on challenging multimodal benchmarks. This study establishes a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval fusion that effectively resolves the isolation of heterogeneous modalities through an evidence fusion mechanism and enhances the robustness of retrieval outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MENT dataset for evaluating non-literal translation quality and proposes RATE framework to address limitations of current MT metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MT metrics are inaccurate for non-literal translations in complex domains like social media and literature, and LLM-as-a-Judge approaches have knowledge cutoff and score inconsistency problems.

Method: Created MENT dataset with 7,530 human-annotated scores across four non-literal translation domains, then proposed RATE framework with a reflective Core Agent that dynamically invokes specialized sub-agents for evaluation.

Result: Traditional MT metrics show inaccuracies, LLM-as-a-Judge has limitations. RATE achieves at least 3.2 meta score improvement over current metrics and demonstrates robustness for general-domain MT evaluation.

Conclusion: RATE framework effectively addresses limitations of existing MT evaluation methods for non-literal translations and shows promise for broader MT evaluation applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Machine Translation (MT), applying them to linguistically complex domains-such as Social Network Services, literature etc. In these scenarios, translations often require handling non-literal expressions, leading to the inaccuracy of MT metrics. To systematically investigate the reliability of MT metrics, we first curate a meta-evaluation dataset focused on non-literal translations, namely MENT. MENT encompasses four non-literal translation domains and features source sentences paired with translations from diverse MT systems, with 7,530 human-annotated scores on translation quality. Experimental results reveal the inaccuracies of traditional MT metrics and the limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge, particularly the knowledge cutoff and score inconsistency problem. To mitigate these limitations, we propose RATE, a novel agentic translation evaluation framework, centered by a reflective Core Agent that dynamically invokes specialized sub-agents. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of RATE, achieving an improvement of at least 3.2 meta score compared with current metrics. Further experiments demonstrate the robustness of RATE to general-domain MT evaluation. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/BITHLP/RATE.

TL;DR: Diffusion LLMs also suffer from the reversal curse despite bidirectional training. The paper identifies three root causes and proposes DiffER with entity-aware training and balanced data construction to address the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the prior assumption that the reversal curse is solely due to autoregressive training, showing that even bidirectionally-trained Diffusion LLMs exhibit this phenomenon. This suggests deeper underlying causes beyond just training directionality.

Method: The authors propose Diffusion Entity-Relation Modeling (DiffER) with three key components: 1) whole-entity masking to prevent entity fragmentation, 2) distribution-symmetric data construction to address data asymmetry, and 3) relation-enhanced data construction to handle missing entity relations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffER effectively alleviates the reversal curse in Diffusion LLMs, showing improved bidirectional reasoning capabilities compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The reversal curse stems from deeper issues beyond just autoregressive training, including entity fragmentation, data asymmetry, and missing relations. DiffER provides an effective solution and offers new research directions for improving bidirectional reasoning in language models.

Abstract: The "reversal curse" refers to the phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) exhibit predominantly unidirectional behavior when processing logically bidirectional relationships. Prior work attributed this to autoregressive training -- predicting the next token inherently favors left-to-right information flow over genuine bidirectional knowledge associations. However, we observe that Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs), despite being trained bidirectionally, also suffer from the reversal curse. To investigate the root causes, we conduct systematic experiments on DLLMs and identify three key reasons: 1) entity fragmentation during training, 2) data asymmetry, and 3) missing entity relations. Motivated by the analysis of these reasons, we propose Diffusion Entity-Relation Modeling (DiffER), which addresses the reversal curse through entity-aware training and balanced data construction. Specifically, DiffER introduces whole-entity masking, which mitigates entity fragmentation by predicting complete entities in a single step. DiffER further employs distribution-symmetric and relation-enhanced data construction strategies to alleviate data asymmetry and missing relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffER effectively alleviates the reversal curse in Diffusion LLMs, offering new perspectives for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-evolution methods for code generation suffer from low exploration efficiency due to initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.

Method: CSE consists of three key components: 1) Diversified Planning Initialization for broad solution space coverage, 2) Genetic Evolution with feedback-guided mutation and compositional crossover, and 3) Hierarchical Evolution Memory capturing both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.

Result: Experiments on EffiBench-X show CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones, achieves higher efficiency from early generations, and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

Conclusion: CSE effectively addresses exploration inefficiencies in self-evolution methods for code generation, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency through controlled evolutionary mechanisms.

Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

TL;DR: RLVR with binary preference labels leads to GRMs guessing outcomes without sound reasoning, causing noisy rewards. Proposed RM-NLHF uses natural language feedback for process rewards, plus MetaRM to scale beyond human critiques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods using binary preference labels allow GRMs to guess correct outcomes without proper reasoning, introducing noise into reward signals and impairing reinforcement learning effectiveness.

Method: Proposed RM-NLHF: uses similarity between GRM-generated and human natural language critiques as training reward. Also introduced MetaRM to predict process rewards from datasets with human critiques and generalize to data without human critiques.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GRMs trained with outcome-only reward, confirming superiority of natural language feedback over binary supervision.

Conclusion: Integrating natural language feedback provides more accurate reward signals than binary outcome-only supervision, addressing the limited solution space problem and improving reinforcement learning effectiveness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable reward (RLVR) on preference data has become the mainstream approach for training Generative Reward Models (GRMs). Typically in pairwise rewarding tasks, GRMs generate reasoning chains ending with critiques and preference labels, and RLVR then relies on the correctness of the preference labels as the training reward. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that such binary classification tasks make GRMs susceptible to guessing correct outcomes without sound critiques. Consequently, these spurious successes introduce substantial noise into the reward signal, thereby impairing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. To address this issue, we propose Reward Modeling from Natural Language Human Feedback (RM-NLHF), which leverages natural language feedback to obtain process reward signals, thereby mitigating the problem of limited solution space inherent in binary tasks. Specifically, we compute the similarity between GRM-generated and human critiques as the training reward, which provides more accurate reward signals than outcome-only supervision. Additionally, considering that human critiques are difficult to scale up, we introduce Meta Reward Model (MetaRM) which learns to predict process reward from datasets with human critiques and then generalizes to data without human critiques. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GRMs trained with outcome-only reward, confirming the superiority of integrating natural language over binary human feedback as supervision.

Motivation: Current diffusion language models rely on hard binary masking and discrete token assignments, which prevent revision of early decisions and underutilize intermediate probabilistic representations.

Method: Proposes EvoToken-DLM that replaces hard binary masks with evolving soft token distributions, enabling progressive transition from masked states to discrete outputs with continuous trajectory supervision for training alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show EvoToken-DLM consistently achieves superior performance, outperforming strong diffusion-based and masked DLM baselines.

Conclusion: EvoToken-DLM's soft token evolution approach with continuous supervision enables revisable decoding and better utilization of intermediate representations, leading to improved performance in diffusion language modeling.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative for language modeling by enabling parallel decoding through iterative refinement. However, most DLMs rely on hard binary masking and discrete token assignments, which hinder the revision of early decisions and underutilize intermediate probabilistic representations. In this paper, we propose EvoToken-DLM, a novel diffusion-based language modeling approach that replaces hard binary masks with evolving soft token distributions. EvoToken-DLM enables a progressive transition from masked states to discrete outputs, supporting revisable decoding. To effectively support this evolution, we introduce continuous trajectory supervision, which aligns training objectives with iterative probabilistic updates. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that EvoToken-DLM consistently achieves superior performance, outperforming strong diffusion-based and masked DLM baselines.

### [113] [TALON: Confidence-Aware Speculative Decoding with Adaptive Token Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07353)
*Tianyu Liu,Qitan Lv,Yuhao Shen,Xiao Sun,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TALON is a training-free, budget-driven adaptive tree expansion framework for speculative decoding that dynamically adjusts draft tree structure based on token difficulty, achieving up to 5.16x speedup over auto-regressive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tree-based speculative decoding methods use fixed-width, fixed-depth draft trees that don't adapt to varying token difficulty, causing inefficiency by not early stopping on difficult tokens or extending generation for simple ones.

Method: TALON constructs draft trees iteratively until a fixed token budget is met, using a hybrid expansion strategy that adaptively allocates node budget to each layer, creating deep-and-narrow trees for deterministic contexts and shallow-and-wide trees for uncertain branches.

Result: Extensive experiments across 5 models and 6 datasets show TALON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.16x end-to-end speedup over auto-regressive decoding.

Conclusion: TALON provides an effective training-free framework that optimizes the trade-off between exploration width and generation depth in speculative decoding, significantly accelerating LLM inference while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has become a standard technique for accelerating LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Recent advances in speculative decoding have shifted from sequential chain-based drafting to tree-structured generation, where the draft model constructs a tree of candidate tokens to explore multiple possible drafts in parallel. However, existing tree-based SD methods typically build a fixed-width, fixed-depth draft tree, which fails to adapt to the varying difficulty of tokens and contexts. As a result, the draft model cannot dynamically adjust the tree structure to early stop on difficult tokens and extend generation for simple ones. To address these challenges, we introduce TALON, a training-free, budget-driven adaptive tree expansion framework that can be plugged into existing tree-based methods. Unlike static methods, TALON constructs the draft tree iteratively until a fixed token budget is met, using a hybrid expansion strategy that adaptively allocates the node budget to each layer of the draft tree. This framework naturally shapes the draft tree into a "deep-and-narrow" form for deterministic contexts and a "shallow-and-wide" form for uncertain branches, effectively optimizing the trade-off between exploration width and generation depth under a given budget. Extensive experiments across 5 models and 6 datasets demonstrate that TALON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.16x end-to-end speedup over auto-regressive decoding.

### [114] [Semantic Compression of LLM Instructions via Symbolic Metalanguages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07354)
*Ernst van Gassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaGlyph is a symbolic language that compresses prompts using mathematical symbols like ∈ and ⇒ that models already understand, achieving 62-81% token reduction across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient prompt compression method that reduces token usage (lowering costs for API deployments and latency/memory for local deployments) by leveraging models' existing understanding of mathematical symbols from training data.

Method: Developed MetaGlyph symbolic language using mathematical symbols (membership ∈, implication ⇒) as "instruction shortcuts" that models can interpret without additional teaching. Evaluated across 8 models varying in scale (3B-1T parameters) and accessibility (open-source vs proprietary APIs).

Result: Achieved 62-81% token reduction across all task types. Best results: Kimi K2 reached 98.1% fidelity for implication and 100% accuracy on selection tasks; GPT-5.2 Chat showed highest membership fidelity (91.3%); Claude Haiku 4.5 achieved 100% parse success. Mid-sized open-source models (7B-12B) showed near-zero operator fidelity, suggesting a U-shaped scale relationship.

Conclusion: MetaGlyph effectively compresses prompts using mathematical symbols that models already understand, with performance varying by model scale and type. Symbolic prompts work best with sufficiently large models, overcoming instruction-tuning biases, and offer practical benefits for both API cost savings and local deployment efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce MetaGlyph, a symbolic language for compressing prompts by encoding instructions as mathematical symbols rather than prose. Unlike systems requiring explicit decoding rules, MetaGlyph uses symbols like $\in$ (membership) and $\Rightarrow$ (implication) that models already understand from their training data. We test whether these symbols work as ''instruction shortcuts'' that models can interpret without additional teaching.
  We evaluate eight models across two dimensions relevant to practitioners: scale (3B-1T parameters) and accessibility (open-source for local deployment vs. proprietary APIs). MetaGlyph achieves 62-81% token reduction across all task types. For API-based deployments, this translates directly to cost savings; for local deployments, it reduces latency and memory pressure.
  Results vary by model. Gemini 2.5 Flash achieves 75% semantic equivalence between symbolic and prose instructions on selection tasks, with 49.9% membership operator fidelity. Kimi K2 reaches 98.1% fidelity for implication ($\Rightarrow$) and achieves perfect (100%) accuracy on selection tasks with symbolic prompts. GPT-5.2 Chat shows the highest membership fidelity observed (91.3%), though with variable parse success across task types. Claude Haiku 4.5 achieves 100% parse success with 26% membership fidelity. Among mid-sized models, Qwen 2.5 7B shows 62% equivalence on extraction tasks. Mid-sized open-source models (7B-12B) show near-zero operator fidelity, suggesting a U-shaped relationship where sufficient scale overcomes instruction-tuning biases.

### [115] [Interpretable Text Classification Applied to the Detection of LLM-generated Creative Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07368)
*Minerva Suvanto,Andrea McGlinchey,Mattias Wahde,Peter J Barclay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Machine learning models can distinguish human-written fiction from LLM-generated text with 93-98% accuracy using simple unigram features, while humans perform near chance levels. An interpretable linear classifier reveals LLMs use more synonyms and show patterns in temporal drift, Americanisms, foreign language, and colloquialisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of distinguishing human-written creative fiction from LLM-generated text, which is important for detecting AI-generated content that might be misrepresented as human work, especially given that human observers perform poorly on this task.

Method: The researchers used various machine learning models to classify text as human-written or LLM-generated, focusing on an interpretable linear classifier that achieved 98% test accuracy. They analyzed short text samples using only single-token (unigram) features to understand what makes the classification possible.

Result: Machine learning models achieved 0.93-0.98 accuracy on unseen test data, while human observers performed near chance levels. The interpretable classifier revealed that LLMs tend to use a larger variety of synonyms, creating detectable probability distributions. Four additional explanation categories were identified: temporal drift, Americanisms, foreign language usage, and colloquialisms.

Conclusion: The classification of AI-generated text is robust due to reliance on multiple linguistic features, making it difficult for malicious actors to circumvent. The findings show that while humans struggle to distinguish human from LLM-generated fiction, machine learning can do so with high accuracy using simple features.

Abstract: We consider the problem of distinguishing human-written creative fiction (excerpts from novels) from similar text generated by an LLM. Our results show that, while human observers perform poorly (near chance levels) on this binary classification task, a variety of machine-learning models achieve accuracy in the range 0.93 - 0.98 over a previously unseen test set, even using only short samples and single-token (unigram) features. We therefore employ an inherently interpretable (linear) classifier (with a test accuracy of 0.98), in order to elucidate the underlying reasons for this high accuracy. In our analysis, we identify specific unigram features indicative of LLM-generated text, one of the most important being that the LLM tends to use a larger variety of synonyms, thereby skewing the probability distributions in a manner that is easy to detect for a machine learning classifier, yet very difficult for a human observer. Four additional explanation categories were also identified, namely, temporal drift, Americanisms, foreign language usage, and colloquialisms. As identification of the AI-generated text depends on a constellation of such features, the classification appears robust, and therefore not easy to circumvent by malicious actors intent on misrepresenting AI-generated text as human work.

*Xin Cheng,Wangding Zeng,Damai Dai,Qinyu Chen,Bingxuan Wang,Zhenda Xie,Kezhao Huang,Xingkai Yu,Zhewen Hao,Yukun Li,Han Zhang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Wenfeng Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Engram, a conditional memory module for Transformers that enables O(1) knowledge lookup, complementing MoE's conditional computation. It discovers a U-shaped scaling law for optimal sparsity allocation between neural computation and static memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack native knowledge lookup primitives, forcing them to inefficiently simulate retrieval through computation. While MoE scales capacity via conditional computation, there's a need for complementary sparsity mechanisms for efficient knowledge access.

Method: Introduces Engram, a conditional memory module based on modernized N-gram embeddings for O(1) lookup. Formulates the Sparsity Allocation problem to optimize trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram), guided by discovered U-shaped scaling law.

Result: Scaling Engram to 27B parameters achieves superior performance over iso-parameter/iso-FLOPs MoE baselines. Gains observed not only in knowledge retrieval (MMLU +3.4, CMMLU +4.0) but also in general reasoning (BBH +5.0, ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains (HumanEval +3.0, MATH +2.4). Engram relieves early layers from static reconstruction, deepens network for reasoning, frees attention for global context, and enables infrastructure-aware efficiency with deterministic addressing.

Conclusion: Conditional memory via Engram is an indispensable modeling primitive for next-generation sparse models, offering efficient knowledge lookup, improved reasoning capabilities, and infrastructure-aware efficiency through deterministic addressing and runtime prefetching.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scales capacity via conditional computation, Transformers lack a native primitive for knowledge lookup, forcing them to inefficiently simulate retrieval through computation. To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embedding for O(1) lookup. By formulating the Sparsity Allocation problem, we uncover a U-shaped scaling law that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram). Guided by this law, we scale Engram to 27B parameters, achieving superior performance over a strictly iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs MoE baseline. Most notably, while the memory module is expected to aid knowledge retrieval (e.g., MMLU +3.4; CMMLU +4.0), we observe even larger gains in general reasoning (e.g., BBH +5.0; ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains~(HumanEval +3.0; MATH +2.4). Mechanistic analyses reveal that Engram relieves the backbone's early layers from static reconstruction, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Furthermore, by delegating local dependencies to lookups, it frees up attention capacity for global context, substantially boosting long-context retrieval (e.g., Multi-Query NIAH: 84.2 to 97.0). Finally, Engram establishes infrastructure-aware efficiency: its deterministic addressing enables runtime prefetching from host memory, incurring negligible overhead. We envision conditional memory as an indispensable modeling primitive for next-generation sparse models.

*Farzad Shami,Subhrasankha Dey,Nico Van de Weghe,Henrikki Tenkanen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GROKE is a vision-free, training-free hierarchical LLM framework that evaluates navigation instructions using OpenStreetMap data, outperforming traditional metrics and visual-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reference-based metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) fail to assess functional utility of navigation instructions, while existing VLN agents require costly visual simulators with licensing constraints and perception errors.

Method: A hierarchical LLM-based framework using OpenStreetMap data with structured JSON/textual spatial formats, combining sub-instruction planning with topological graph navigation without visual dependencies.

Result: Structured JSON/textual formats outperform grid/visual graph representations; reduces navigation error by 68.5% vs baselines on Map2Seq; establishes scalable, interpretable evaluation paradigm.

Conclusion: GROKE provides a vision-free, scalable solution for functional evaluation of navigation instructions using OSM data, overcoming limitations of traditional metrics and visual-dependent approaches.

Abstract: The evaluation of navigation instructions remains a persistent challenge in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) research. Traditional reference-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the functional utility of spatial directives, specifically whether an instruction successfully guides a navigator to the intended destination. Although existing VLN agents could serve as evaluators, their reliance on high-fidelity visual simulators introduces licensing constraints and computational costs, and perception errors further confound linguistic quality assessment. This paper introduces GROKE(Graph-based Reasoning over OSM Knowledge for instruction Evaluation), a vision-free training-free hierarchical LLM-based framework for evaluating navigation instructions using OpenStreetMap data. Through systematic ablation studies, we demonstrate that structured JSON and textual formats for spatial information substantially outperform grid-based and visual graph representations. Our hierarchical architecture combines sub-instruction planning with topological graph navigation, reducing navigation error by 68.5% compared to heuristic and sampling baselines on the Map2Seq dataset. The agent's execution success, trajectory fidelity, and decision patterns serve as proxy metrics for functional navigability given OSM-visible landmarks and topology, establishing a scalable and interpretable evaluation paradigm without visual dependencies.

### [118] [Outcome-Grounded Advantage Reshaping for Fine-Grained Credit Assignment in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07408)
*Ziheng Li,Liu Kang,Feng Xiao,Luxi Xing,Qingyi Si,Zhuoran Li,Weikang Gong,Deqing Yang,Yanghua Xiao,Hongcheng Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OAR introduces fine-grained credit assignment for GRPO by redistributing advantages based on token influence on final answers, using perturbation-based (OAR-P) and gradient-based (OAR-G) strategies with bi-level reshaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GRPO uses coarse-grained credit assignment that uniformly propagates group-level rewards to all tokens, ignoring varying contributions of individual reasoning steps to the final answer.

Method: OAR uses outcome-grounded advantage reshaping with two strategies: OAR-P estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations; OAR-G uses input-gradient sensitivity proxy with single backward pass. Both use conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping to suppress low-impact tokens and boost pivotal ones.

Result: OAR-P sets performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead. Both significantly outperform strong GRPO baseline on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: OAR pushes boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning by enabling fine-grained credit assignment that properly attributes token-level contributions to final outcomes.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a promising critic-free reinforcement learning paradigm for reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning.

### [119] [Two Pathways to Truthfulness: On the Intrinsic Encoding of LLM Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07422)
*Wen Luo,Guangyue Peng,Wei Li,Shaohang Wei,Feifan Song,Liang Wang,Nan Yang,Xingxing Zhang,Jing Jin,Furu Wei,Houfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs encode truthfulness through two distinct pathways: Question-Anchored (question-answer flow) and Answer-Anchored (self-contained answer evidence), which relate to knowledge boundaries and enable improved hallucination detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' impressive capabilities, they frequently generate hallucinations. While previous work shows internal states encode truthfulness signals, the origins and mechanisms of these signals remain unclear. The paper aims to understand how LLMs internally encode truthfulness to enable more reliable systems.

Method: Used attention knockout and token patching to validate and disentangle two truthfulness pathways: Question-Anchored (depends on question-answer information flow) and Answer-Anchored (derives self-contained evidence from generated answer). Investigated properties of these mechanisms and their association with LLM knowledge boundaries.

Result: Discovered that the two truthfulness mechanisms are closely associated with LLM knowledge boundaries, and internal representations are aware of their distinctions. Based on these findings, proposed two applications to enhance hallucination detection performance.

Conclusion: The work provides new insight into how LLMs internally encode truthfulness, offering directions for more reliable and self-aware generative systems by understanding the dual-pathway mechanism of truthfulness encoding.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations. Previous work shows that their internal states encode rich signals of truthfulness, yet the origins and mechanisms of these signals remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that truthfulness cues arise from two distinct information pathways: (1) a Question-Anchored pathway that depends on question-answer information flow, and (2) an Answer-Anchored pathway that derives self-contained evidence from the generated answer itself. First, we validate and disentangle these pathways through attention knockout and token patching. Afterwards, we uncover notable and intriguing properties of these two mechanisms. Further experiments reveal that (1) the two mechanisms are closely associated with LLM knowledge boundaries; and (2) internal representations are aware of their distinctions. Finally, building on these insightful findings, two applications are proposed to enhance hallucination detection performance. Overall, our work provides new insight into how LLMs internally encode truthfulness, offering directions for more reliable and self-aware generative systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAD is the first large-scale strategic argumentative dialogue dataset with 392,822 examples, annotated with five strategy types per utterance, enabling multi-turn argument generation conditioned on dialogue history, stance, and targeted strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing argumentation corpora focus on non-interactive, single-turn settings, but real argumentation occurs as multi-turn dialogues where speakers employ diverse strategies to strengthen persuasiveness. There's a need for datasets that support deeper modeling of strategic argumentation dialogues.

Method: Created SAD dataset grounded in argumentation theories, annotating each utterance with five strategy types (allowing multiple strategies per utterance). The dataset enables models to generate contextually appropriate arguments conditioned on dialogue history, specified stance, and targeted argumentation strategies.

Result: Produced a large-scale dataset of 392,822 examples with strategy annotations. Benchmarked various pretrained generative models on SAD and conducted in-depth analysis of strategy usage patterns in argumentation dialogues.

Conclusion: SAD fills the gap in argumentation research by providing the first large-scale strategic argumentative dialogue dataset, enabling more realistic modeling of multi-turn argumentation with diverse persuasive strategies.

Abstract: Argumentation generation has attracted substantial research interest due to its central role in human reasoning and decision-making. However, most existing argumentative corpora focus on non-interactive, single-turn settings, either generating arguments from a given topic or refuting an existing argument. In practice, however, argumentation is often realized as multi-turn dialogue, where speakers defend their stances and employ diverse argumentative strategies to strengthen persuasiveness. To support deeper modeling of argumentation dialogue, we present the first large-scale \textbf{S}trategic \textbf{A}rgumentative \textbf{D}ialogue dataset, SAD, consisting of 392,822 examples. Grounded in argumentation theories, we annotate each utterance with five strategy types, allowing multiple strategies per utterance. Unlike prior datasets, SAD requires models to generate contextually appropriate arguments conditioned on the dialogue history, a specified stance on the topic, and targeted argumentation strategies. We further benchmark a range of pretrained generative models on SAD and present in-depth analysis of strategy usage patterns in argumentation.

*Qitan Lv,Tianyu Liu,Qiaosheng Zhang,Xingcheng Xu,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KALE is a post-training framework that uses knowledge graphs to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability, addressing the "known&incorrect" phenomenon where models have relevant knowledge but fail to use it correctly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit the "known&incorrect" phenomenon - they possess relevant knowledge but fail to leverage it for correct answers. Existing SFT methods don't adequately address this knowledge manipulation challenge.

Method: KALE uses a two-stage approach: 1) Knowledge-Induced data synthesis extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from knowledge graphs to generate high-quality rationales for QA pairs; 2) Knowledge-Aware fine-tuning enhances knowledge manipulation by minimizing KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks across six LLMs show KALE achieves accuracy improvements of up to 11.72% and an average of 4.18%.

Conclusion: KALE effectively enhances LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability by leveraging knowledge graphs to generate rationales and internalize reasoning patterns, addressing the "known&incorrect" problem better than standard SFT approaches.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast knowledge corpora, advancing their knowledge manipulation-the ability to effectively recall, reason, and transfer relevant knowledge-remains challenging. Existing methods mainly leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on labeled datasets to enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. However, we observe that SFT models still exhibit the known&incorrect phenomenon, where they explicitly possess relevant knowledge for a given question but fail to leverage it for correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose KALE (Knowledge-Aware LEarning)-a post-training framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. Specifically, KALE first introduces a Knowledge-Induced (KI) data synthesis method that efficiently extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from KGs to generate high-quality rationales for question-answer pairs. Then, KALE employs a Knowledge-Aware (KA) fine-tuning paradigm that enhances knowledge manipulation by internalizing rationale-guided reasoning through minimizing the KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales. Extensive experiments on eight popular benchmarks across six different LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of KALE, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 11.72% and an average of 4.18%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM judges fail at QA evaluation when reference answers conflict with their parametric knowledge, causing unreliable scores due to judges ignoring provided references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs perform as automatic judges for QA evaluation when the provided reference answer conflicts with their internal knowledge, revealing a critical vulnerability in reference-based evaluation protocols.

Method: Introduced a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts by replacing correct references with incorrect entities, creating diverse pairings of original/swapped references with aligned candidate answers.

Result: Grading reliability drops sharply under swapped references across various judge models; judges over-rely on parametric knowledge and disregard given references when conflicts occur; this failure persists despite common prompt-based mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: This reveals a fundamental limitation of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, motivating the need for reference-based protocols that enforce stronger adherence to provided references rather than relying on judges' parametric knowledge.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic judges for question answering (QA) and other reference-conditioned evaluation tasks, little is known about their ability to adhere to a provided reference. We identify a critical failure mode of such reference-based LLM QA evaluation: when the provided reference conflicts with the judge model's parametric knowledge, the resulting scores become unreliable, substantially degrading evaluation fidelity. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts. Specifically, we replace the reference answer with an incorrect entity and construct diverse pairings of original and swapped references with correspondingly aligned candidate answers. Surprisingly, grading reliability drops sharply under swapped references across a broad set of judge models. We empirically show that this vulnerability is driven by judges' over-reliance on parametric knowledge, leading judges to disregard the given reference under conflict. Finally, we find that this failure persists under common prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting a fundamental limitation of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and motivating reference-based protocols that enforce stronger adherence to the provided reference.

TL;DR: SMoA is a structured modulation adapter that achieves higher rank with fewer parameters than LoRA, improving representational capacity and performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow larger, PEFT methods like LoRA are needed for efficient fine-tuning, but low-rank approaches face limited representational capacity compared to full fine-tuning.

Method: SMoA freezes pretrained weights and selectively amplifies/suppresses important features across multiple subspaces, using structured modulation to maintain higher rank with fewer parameters.

Result: SMoA outperforms LoRA and its variants on 10 tasks, with ablation studies validating effectiveness and theoretical analysis supporting the approach.

Conclusion: SMoA provides an efficient high-rank alternative to low-rank PEFT methods, offering better representational capacity and performance with fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: As the number of model parameters increases, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the go-to choice for tailoring pre-trained large language models. Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) uses a low-rank update method to simulate full parameter fine-tuning, which is widely used to reduce resource requirements. However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with limited representational capacity when compared to full parameter fine-tuning. We present \textbf{SMoA}, a high-rank \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{MO}dulation \textbf{A}dapter that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby improving the model's representational capacity and offering improved performance potential. The core idea is to freeze the original pretrained weights and selectively amplify or suppress important features of the original weights across multiple subspaces. The subspace mechanism provides an efficient way to increase the capacity and complexity of a model. We conduct both theoretical analyses and empirical studies on various tasks. Experiment results show that SMoA outperforms LoRA and its variants on 10 tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning of multimodal conversational agents faces challenges with extremely large text token spaces. Need a more efficient approach to handle action space complexity.

Method: Learn compact latent action space via learning from observation mechanism. Use both paired image-text and text-only data with cross-modal projector to transform text embeddings into image-text embeddings. Train projector with cycle consistency loss on text-only data.

Result: Latent action based method outperforms competitive baselines on two conversation tasks across various RL algorithms.

Conclusion: Learning compact latent action spaces with cross-modal projection from both paired and text-only data effectively addresses RL fine-tuning challenges for multimodal conversational agents.

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly employed as multimodal conversational agents (MCAs) for diverse conversational tasks. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for adapting MCAs to various human-AI interaction scenarios. Despite showing great enhancement in generalization performance, fine-tuning MCAs via RL still faces challenges in handling the extremely large text token space. To address this, we learn a compact latent action space for RL fine-tuning instead. Specifically, we adopt the learning from observation mechanism to construct the codebook for the latent action space, where future observations are leveraged to estimate current latent actions that could further be used to reconstruct future observations. However, the scarcity of paired image-text data hinders learning a codebook with sufficient coverage. Thus, we leverage both paired image-text data and text-only data to construct the latent action space, using a cross-modal projector for transforming text embeddings into image-text embeddings. We initialize the cross-modal projector on paired image-text data, and further train it on massive text-only data with a novel cycle consistency loss to enhance its robustness. We show that our latent action based method outperforms competitive baselines on two conversation tasks across various RL algorithms.

TL;DR: Hybrid approach combining natural reasoning with structured output generation using trigger tokens to switch between modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural generation allows rich reasoning but lacks structure, while structured generation ensures parsable outputs but restricts reasoning. Need to combine both advantages.

Method: Allow LLMs to reason freely in natural language until specific trigger tokens appear, then switch to structured generation for final output.

Result: Achieves up to 27% accuracy gain over natural generation with only 10-20 extra token overhead, effective on both classification and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach successfully preserves expressive reasoning while ensuring reliable structured outputs, offering best of both worlds.

Abstract: Natural generation allows Language Models (LMs) to produce free-form responses with rich reasoning, but the lack of guaranteed structure makes outputs difficult to parse or verify. Structured generation, or constrained decoding, addresses this drawback by producing content in standardized formats such as JSON, ensuring consistency and guaranteed-parsable outputs, but it can inadvertently restrict the model's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple approach that combines the advantages of both natural and structured generation. By allowing LLMs to reason freely until specific trigger tokens are generated, and then switching to structured generation, our method preserves the expressive power of natural language reasoning while ensuring the reliability of structured outputs. We further evaluate our approach on several datasets, covering both classification and reasoning tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a substantial gain of up to 27% in accuracy compared to natural generation, while requiring only a small overhead of 10-20 extra tokens.

TL;DR: ISLAMICFAITHQA benchmark for evaluating Islamic QA systems with focus on hallucination detection and abstention, plus agentic RAG framework for Quran-grounded responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MCQ/MRC evaluations don't capture real-world failure modes in Islamic QA, particularly free-form hallucinations and inappropriate responses when evidence is lacking, which can have serious religious consequences.

Method: Created ISLAMICFAITHQA benchmark (3,810 bilingual items), developed grounded Islamic modeling suite with SFT reasoning pairs, preference samples, and Quran retrieval corpus, and built agentic RAG framework using structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking.

Result: Retrieval improves correctness, agentic RAG yields largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving SOTA performance with strong Arabic-English robustness even with small models (Qwen3 4B).

Conclusion: The benchmark and agentic RAG framework effectively address hallucination and abstention issues in Islamic QA, providing robust solutions for religiously-sensitive applications.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for Islamic question answering, where ungrounded responses may carry serious religious consequences. Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B). We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.

### [127] [A Unified Framework for Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis via Expert-Guided Multimodal Fusion with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07565)
*Jiaqi Qiao,Xiujuan Xu,Xinran Li,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EGMF is a unified multimodal emotion understanding framework that combines expert-guided multimodal fusion with LLMs for both discrete emotion recognition and continuous sentiment analysis, showing superior performance across English and Chinese benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal emotion understanding requires effective integration of text, audio, and visual modalities for both discrete emotion recognition and continuous sentiment analysis, but existing approaches lack unified frameworks that can handle both tasks while maintaining cross-lingual robustness.

Method: EGMF combines expert-guided multimodal fusion with LLMs using three specialized expert networks (fine-grained local, semantic correlation, and global context experts) integrated through hierarchical dynamic gating. Enhanced multimodal representations are integrated with LLMs via pseudo token injection and prompt-based conditioning, enabling a single generative framework for both classification and regression through natural language generation, with LoRA fine-tuning for efficiency.

Result: Experiments on bilingual benchmarks (MELD, CHERMA, MOSEI, SIMS-V2) demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with superior cross-lingual robustness revealing universal patterns in multimodal emotional expressions across English and Chinese.

Conclusion: EGMF provides a unified, effective framework for multimodal emotion understanding that successfully integrates expert-guided fusion with LLMs, demonstrating strong performance across languages and tasks while revealing universal emotional expression patterns.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion understanding requires effective integration of text, audio, and visual modalities for both discrete emotion recognition and continuous sentiment analysis. We present EGMF, a unified framework combining expert-guided multimodal fusion with large language models. Our approach features three specialized expert networks--a fine-grained local expert for subtle emotional nuances, a semantic correlation expert for cross-modal relationships, and a global context expert for long-range dependencies--adaptively integrated through hierarchical dynamic gating for context-aware feature selection. Enhanced multimodal representations are integrated with LLMs via pseudo token injection and prompt-based conditioning, enabling a single generative framework to handle both classification and regression through natural language generation. We employ LoRA fine-tuning for computational efficiency. Experiments on bilingual benchmarks (MELD, CHERMA, MOSEI, SIMS-V2) demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with superior cross-lingual robustness revealing universal patterns in multimodal emotional expressions across English and Chinese. We will release the source code publicly.

### [128] [ES-Mem: Event Segmentation-Based Memory for Long-Term Dialogue Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07582)
*Huhai Zou,Tianhao Sun,Chuanjiang He,Yu Tian,Zhenyang Li,Li Jin,Nayu Liu,Jiang Zhong,Kaiwen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ES-Mem is a memory framework for dialogue agents that uses event segmentation theory to create coherent memory units and hierarchical retrieval for precise context localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory mechanisms have two key limitations: rigid memory granularity disrupts semantic integrity, and flat retrieval paradigms rely only on surface-level similarity while neglecting structural discourse cues needed to navigate episodic contexts.

Method: Proposes ES-Mem with two core components: (1) dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries, and (2) hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization.

Result: Evaluations on two memory benchmarks show consistent performance gains over baseline methods. The event segmentation module also exhibits robust applicability on dialogue segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: ES-Mem addresses limitations of existing memory mechanisms by incorporating event segmentation theory to create more coherent memory units and enable precise context localization through hierarchical memory architecture.

Abstract: Memory is critical for dialogue agents to maintain coherence and enable continuous adaptation in long-term interactions. While existing memory mechanisms offer basic storage and retrieval capabilities, they are hindered by two primary limitations: (1) rigid memory granularity often disrupts semantic integrity, resulting in fragmented and incoherent memory units; (2) prevalent flat retrieval paradigms rely solely on surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the structural cues of discourse required to navigate and locate specific episodic contexts. To mitigate these limitations, drawing inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory, we propose ES-Mem, a framework incorporating two core components: (1) a dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries; (2) a hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization. Evaluations on two memory benchmarks demonstrate that ES-Mem yields consistent performance gains over baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed event segmentation module exhibits robust applicability on dialogue segmentation datasets.

*Bingyang Ye,Shan Chen,Jingxuan Tu,Chen Liu,Zidi Xiong,Samuel Schmidgall,Danielle S. Bitterman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoT is a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that evaluates LLMs' scientific idea judgments by linking them to future observable signals like citations, enabling scalable evaluation without expert annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used to assess research ideas, but there's a lack of scalable ways to evaluate the quality of their scientific judgments. Current methods don't effectively connect model assessments to real-world scientific impact signals.

Method: PoT freezes pre-cutoff evidence snapshots in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes (citations, research agenda shifts). It enables verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives later, and provides a testbed for comparing tool-using agents vs non-agent baselines with prompt ablations and budget scaling.

Result: Across 30,000+ instances in four benchmark domains, higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task-dependent. The framework successfully enables scalable evaluation of agents on future-facing scientific judgment tasks.

Conclusion: PoT provides a scalable, semi-verifiable framework for evaluating LLMs' scientific idea judgments by linking them to future observable signals, supporting better assessment of research forecasting capabilities and human-model alignment in scientific evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly being used to assess and forecast research ideas, yet we lack scalable ways to evaluate the quality of models' judgments about these scientific ideas. Towards this goal, we introduce PoT, a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that links scientific idea judgments to downstream signals that become observable later (e.g., citations and shifts in researchers' agendas). PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives, scalable benchmarking without exhaustive expert annotation, and analysis of human-model misalignment against signals such as peer-review awards. In addition, PoT provides a controlled testbed for agent-based research judgments that evaluate scientific ideas, comparing tool-using agents to non-agent baselines under prompt ablations and budget scaling. Across 30,000+ instances spanning four benchmark domains, we find that, compared with non-agent baselines, higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task-dependent. By combining time-partitioned, future-verifiable targets with an offline sandbox for tool use, PoT supports scalable evaluation of agents on future-facing scientific idea judgment tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pilot deployment of Descartes multilingual model for generating Wikipedia short descriptions shows promising results with 90% of accepted suggestions rated at least 3/5 in quality, comparable to human-written descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia short descriptions have uneven coverage across languages and topics, creating content gaps that need to be addressed to improve the user experience.

Method: Deployed Descartes multilingual model in Wikipedia Android app to offer short description suggestions to editors during editing. Experiment spanned 12 languages with 3,900+ articles and 375 editors participating.

Result: 90% of accepted Descartes descriptions rated at least 3/5 in quality, comparable to human-written ones. Editors adopted suggestions both directly and with modifications, with low revert and report rates. Identified practical deployment considerations including latency, language-specific gaps, and sensitive topic safeguards.

Conclusion: Descartes can effectively support editors in reducing content gaps, but requires technical, design, and community guardrails for successful deployment.

Abstract: Short descriptions are a key part of the Wikipedia user experience, but their coverage remains uneven across languages and topics. In previous work, we introduced Descartes, a multilingual model for generating short descriptions. In this report, we present the results of a pilot deployment of Descartes in the Wikipedia Android app, where editors were offered suggestions based on outputs from Descartes while editing short descriptions. The experiment spanned 12 languages, with over 3,900 articles and 375 editors participating. Overall, 90% of accepted Descartes descriptions were rated at least 3 out of 5 in quality, and their average ratings were comparable to human-written ones. Editors adopted machine suggestions both directly and with modifications, while the rate of reverts and reports remained low. The pilot also revealed practical considerations for deployment, including latency, language-specific gaps, and the need for safeguards around sensitive topics. These results indicate that Descartes's short descriptions can support editors in reducing content gaps, provided that technical, design, and community guardrails are in place.

TL;DR: Training-free framework using plateau-guided model merging to mitigate multimodal instruction fine-tuning degradation of text reasoning in MLLMs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal instruction fine-tuning paradoxically degrades the strong linguistic reasoning capability inherited from base language models, undermining multimodal performance in MLLMs

Method: Proposes plateau-guided model merging: uses layer-wise vision token masking to reveal three-stage pattern (early-modal separation, mid-modal alignment, late-modal degradation), then selectively injects base language model parameters into MLLMs based on analysis of different stages

Result: Experimental results on five MLLMs across nine benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness; attention analysis shows merging shifts attention from diffuse patterns to focused localization on task-relevant visual regions

Conclusion: Proposed training-free framework successfully mitigates degradation of text reasoning in MLLMs through plateau-guided model merging, improving multimodal performance while preserving linguistic capabilities

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on strong linguistic reasoning inherited from their base language models. However, multimodal instruction fine-tuning paradoxically degrades this text's reasoning capability, undermining multimodal performance. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework to mitigate this degradation. Through layer-wise vision token masking, we reveal a common three-stage pattern in multimodal large language models: early-modal separation, mid-modal alignment, and late-modal degradation. By analyzing the behavior of MLLMs at different stages, we propose a plateau-guided model merging method that selectively injects base language model parameters into MLLMs. Experimental results based on five MLLMs on nine benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Attention-based analysis further reveals that merging shifts attention from diffuse, scattered patterns to focused localization on task-relevant visual regions.

*Jing Yang,Nils Feldhus,Salar Mohtaj,Leonhard Hennig,Qianli Wang,Eleni Metheniti,Sherzod Hakimov,Charlott Jakob,Veronika Solopova,Konrad Rieck,David Schlangen,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic review of NLG evaluation trends across 14k+ papers shows task-specific adoption patterns, persistent use of outdated metrics without justification, and divergence between LLM-as-judge methods and human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in NLG, evaluation remains challenging with human judgment as gold standard. Need to systematically review how NLG evaluation has evolved across major conferences over six years to understand current practices and identify issues.

Method: Used automatic information extraction scheme to gather key information from 14,171 papers across ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and INLG conferences over six years. Focused on different evaluation methods: metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, and human evaluation.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Task divergence in evaluation adoption - Dialogue Generation rapidly shifting to LaaJ (>40% in 2025), Machine Translation stuck with n-gram metrics, Question Answering showing decline in human evaluation. (2) Metric inertia - general-purpose metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) widely used without justification, lacking discriminative power. (3) Human-LaaJ divergence - LLMs not acting as human proxies, prioritizing different signals, with only moderate to low correlation and scarce validation (<8% papers compare them).

Conclusion: Derived practical recommendations to improve rigor of future NLG evaluation based on systematic analysis of current practices, highlighting need for task-specific evaluation approaches, justification of metric choices, and better validation of LLM-as-judge methods against human evaluation.

Abstract: Despite advances in Natural Language Generation (NLG), evaluation remains challenging. Although various new metrics and LLM-as-a-judge (LaaJ) methods are proposed, human judgment persists as the gold standard. To systematically review how NLG evaluation has evolved, we employ an automatic information extraction scheme to gather key information from NLG papers, focusing on different evaluation methods (metrics, LaaJ and human evaluation). With extracted metadata from 14,171 papers across four major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and INLG) over the past six years, we reveal several critical findings: (1) Task Divergence: While Dialogue Generation demonstrates a rapid shift toward LaaJ (>40% in 2025), Machine Translation remains locked into n-gram metrics, and Question Answering exhibits a substantial decline in the proportion of studies conducting human evaluation. (2) Metric Inertia: Despite the development of semantic metrics, general-purpose metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) continue to be widely used across tasks without empirical justification, often lacking the discriminative power to distinguish between specific quality criteria. (3) Human-LaaJ Divergence: Our association analysis challenges the assumption that LLMs act as mere proxies for humans; LaaJ and human evaluations prioritize very different signals, and explicit validation is scarce (<8% of papers comparing the two), with only moderate to low correlation. Based on these observations, we derive practical recommendations to improve the rigor of future NLG evaluation.

### [133] [Adaptive Layer Selection for Layer-Wise Token Pruning in LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07667)
*Rei Taniguchi,Yuyang Dong,Makoto Onizuka,Chuan Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASL is a training-free method that adaptively chooses selection layers for KV cache reduction in LLM inference, using token rank variance to balance performance across tasks while meeting KV budget requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layer-wise token pruning methods use fixed pre-defined layers for KV cache reduction, which is inflexible and causes significant accuracy variation across tasks, especially deteriorating in harder tasks like KV retrieval.

Method: ASL adaptively chooses selection layers for KV cache reduction by exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. It operates during prefilling stage and can be combined with existing methods like SnapKV. Uses one-shot token selection where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers.

Result: ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction, as evaluated on InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks.

Conclusion: ASL provides a flexible, training-free approach to KV cache reduction that adapts to different tasks, balancing performance while meeting KV budget requirements, and can be integrated with existing optimization methods.

Abstract: Due to the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), key-value (KV) cache reduction for LLM inference has received remarkable attention. Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.

### [134] [Exploring the Meta-level Reasoning of Large Language Models via a Tool-based Multi-hop Tabular Question Answering Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07696)
*Nick Ferguson,Alan Bundy,Kwabena Nuamah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structured approach to analyzing LLM reasoning by distinguishing meta-level reasoning (planning steps) from object-level reasoning (executing steps), using a geopolitical indicator QA task to evaluate LLMs' ability to select appropriate tools and break down complex questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bring structure to the often overlapping definitions of "reasoning" in LLM discourse by distinguishing between meta-level and object-level reasoning, and to provide deeper analysis beyond just final answer accuracy by examining the reasoning process itself.

Method: The authors designed a novel QA task based on geopolitical indicators across countries and years, requiring breakdown into intermediate steps, data retrieval, and mathematical operations. They analyzed meta-level reasoning by examining LLMs' tool selection and compared tool call outputs against 'essential actions' to infer reasoning strength.

Result: LLMs demonstrated good meta-level reasoning on the task but showed flaws in task understanding. N-shot prompting had little effect on accuracy, error messages didn't significantly deteriorate performance, and additional evidence was found for LLMs' poor numeracy skills.

Conclusion: The paper provides a structured framework for analyzing LLM reasoning and shows that while LLMs have decent meta-level reasoning capabilities, they still struggle with task understanding and numeracy. The findings have implications for generalization to other task domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly focused on "reasoning" ability, a concept with many overlapping definitions in the LLM discourse. We take a more structured approach, distinguishing meta-level reasoning (denoting the process of reasoning about intermediate steps required to solve a task) from object-level reasoning (which concerns the low-level execution of the aforementioned steps.) We design a novel question answering task, which is based around the values of geopolitical indicators for various countries over various years. Questions require breaking down into intermediate steps, retrieval of data, and mathematical operations over that data. The meta-level reasoning ability of LLMs is analysed by examining the selection of appropriate tools for answering questions. To bring greater depth to the analysis of LLMs beyond final answer accuracy, our task contains 'essential actions' against which we can compare the tool call output of LLMs to infer the strength of reasoning ability. We find that LLMs demonstrate good meta-level reasoning on our task, yet are flawed in some aspects of task understanding. We find that n-shot prompting has little effect on accuracy; error messages encountered do not often deteriorate performance; and provide additional evidence for the poor numeracy of LLMs. Finally, we discuss the generalisation and limitation of our findings to other task domains.

*Chaewon Heo,Cheyon Jin,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed a controllable seeker simulator for emotional support chatbots using 9 psychological/linguistic features and MoE architecture to address limitations in current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotional support chatbot evaluation uses help-seeker simulators that fail to capture real-world seeker diversity (overly cooperative) and lack controllability for specific seeker profiles.

Method: Created a controllable seeker simulator driven by 9 psychological/linguistic features, trained on authentic Reddit conversations using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to differentiate diverse seeker behaviors into specialized parameter subspaces.

Result: Simulator achieves superior profile adherence and behavioral diversity compared to existing approaches, and evaluating 7 prominent supporter models reveals previously obscured performance degradations.

Conclusion: The framework provides more faithful and stress-tested evaluation for emotional support chatbots, addressing critical limitations in current evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: As emotional support chatbots have recently gained significant traction across both research and industry, a common evaluation strategy has emerged: use help-seeker simulators to interact with supporter chatbots. However, current simulators suffer from two critical limitations: (1) they fail to capture the behavioral diversity of real-world seekers, often portraying them as overly cooperative, and (2) they lack the controllability required to simulate specific seeker profiles. To address these challenges, we present a controllable seeker simulator driven by nine psychological and linguistic features that underpin seeker behavior. Using authentic Reddit conversations, we train our model via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which effectively differentiates diverse seeker behaviors into specialized parameter subspaces, thereby enhancing fine-grained controllability. Our simulator achieves superior profile adherence and behavioral diversity compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, evaluating 7 prominent supporter models with our system uncovers previously obscured performance degradations. These findings underscore the utility of our framework in providing a more faithful and stress-tested evaluation for emotional support chatbots.

*Pietro Ferrazzi,Milica Cvjeticanin,Alessio Piraccini,Davide Giannuzzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares Enhanced RAG (with dedicated modules for specific weaknesses) vs Agentic RAG (where LLMs orchestrate the entire process) through extensive empirical evaluation to provide practical guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Basic RAG systems have limitations: noisy/suboptimal retrieval, misuse for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and generator variability/cost. Two paradigms have emerged to address these issues - Enhanced RAG with dedicated modules and Agentic RAG with LLM orchestration - but it's unclear which approach is preferable under different conditions.

Method: Conducted an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. The study systematically compares both paradigms to understand their trade-offs.

Result: The evaluation provides practical insights into the trade-offs between Enhanced and Agentic RAG paradigms. Results offer guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design considering both costs and performance for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The paper establishes empirical evidence for choosing between Enhanced RAG (with engineered modules) and Agentic RAG (with LLM orchestration) based on specific conditions and requirements, helping practitioners make informed decisions about RAG system design.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of "Enhanced" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as "Agentic" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.

*Aryan Mishra,Akash Anil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework that enhances LLMs' numerical reasoning in financial documents by incorporating structured knowledge graphs, achieving ~12% improvement in execution accuracy on FinQA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with numerical reasoning in financial documents due to challenges in processing numbers from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and performing accurate calculations. Structured data augmentations like knowledge graphs have shown promise in improving LLM predictions with logical explanations.

Method: Proposes a framework that incorporates structured information using knowledge graphs alongside LLM predictions for numerical reasoning. KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document being processed.

Result: Evaluated on FinQA benchmark using Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, the framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured information through knowledge graphs significantly enhances LLMs' numerical reasoning capabilities for financial document analysis, addressing key bottlenecks in processing financial data.

Abstract: Numerical reasoning is an important task in the analysis of financial documents. It helps in understanding and performing numerical predictions with logical conclusions for the given query seeking answers from financial texts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multiple Question-Answering (Q-A) systems with the capability of logical reasoning. As documents related to finance often consist of long and complex financial contexts, LLMs appear well-suited for building high-quality automated financial question-answering systems. However, LLMs often face challenges in accurately processing the various numbers within financial reports. Extracting numerical data from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and reliably performing accurate calculations, remains a significant bottleneck for numerical reasoning in most state-of-the-art LLMs. Recent studies have shown that structured data augmentations, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs), have notably improved the predictions of LLMs along with logical explanations. Thus, it is an important requirement to consider inherent structured information in financial reports while using LLMs for various financial analytics. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate structured information using KGs along with LLM predictions for numerical reasoning tasks. The KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document under processing. We evaluated our proposed framework over the benchmark data FinQA, using an open-source LLM, namely Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. We observed that the proposed framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM.

*Igor Sterner,Alex Lascarides,Frank Keller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Contrastive learning framework for narrative salience using narrative twins (same plot, different surface form) outperforms MLM baseline, with summarization being most effective for identifying salient sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding narratives requires identifying which events are most salient for story progression. Current methods need improvement for modeling narrative salience effectively.

Method: Contrastive learning framework that learns story embeddings from narrative twins (stories sharing same plot but differing in surface form). Model distinguishes story from narrative twin and distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Evaluates four narratologically motivated operations: deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization.

Result: Contrastively learned story embeddings outperform masked-language-model baseline. Summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. When narrative twins unavailable, random dropout can generate twins from single story. Effective distractors can be obtained via LLM prompting or using different parts of same story for long-form narratives.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning with narrative twins effectively models narrative salience, with summarization being the best operation for identifying salient content. The framework provides practical solutions when narrative twins are unavailable.

Abstract: Understanding narratives requires identifying which events are most salient for a story's progression. We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PR-CoT enhances Chain-of-Thought reasoning with multi-perspective self-reflection across logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions, improving accuracy without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting has limitations in consistency, accuracy, and self-correction, especially for complex or ethically sensitive tasks. Existing single-dimensional reflection methods provide insufficient improvements.

Method: MyGO Poly-Reflective Chain-of-Thought (PR-CoT) uses structured multi-perspective reflection after initial CoT reasoning. The LLM self-assesses across four angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering without model retraining.

Result: Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 show PR-CoT significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making.

Conclusion: PR-CoT's poly-reflective paradigm fosters more reliable LLM reasoning, validated by ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses showing the contribution of each reflection perspective.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting advances LLM reasoning, challenges persist in consistency, accuracy, and self-correction, especially for complex or ethically sensitive tasks. Existing single-dimensional reflection methods offer insufficient improvements. We propose MyGO Poly-Reflective Chain-of-Thought (PR-CoT), a novel methodology employing structured multi-perspective reflection. After initial CoT, PR-CoT guides the LLM to self-assess its reasoning across multiple predefined angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering, this process refines the initial CoT into a more robust and accurate final answer without model retraining. Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles, using GPT-three point five and GPT-four models, demonstrate PR-CoT's superior performance. It significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses further validate the contribution of each reflection perspective and the overall efficacy of our poly-reflective paradigm in fostering more reliable LLM reasoning.

*Wei Fang,James Glass*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOOLQP is a lightweight framework that models tool retrieval as iterative query planning instead of single-shot matching, achieving SOTA performance with better generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex tool requests due to the semantic gap between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions.

Method: TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, bridging the semantic gap. It's trained using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).

Result: TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.

Conclusion: Modeling retrieval as iterative query planning effectively addresses the limitations of single-shot retrievers for complex tool composition tasks, enabling better tool discovery and agent performance.

Abstract: LLM agents operating over massive, dynamic tool libraries rely on effective retrieval, yet standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex requests. These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.

### [141] [Kinship Data Benchmark for Multi-hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07794)
*Tianda Sun,Dimitar Kazakov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KinshipQA is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' multi-hop reasoning using kinship relations, generated through a pipeline that creates culture-specific genealogical data with controlled difficulty and cultural assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need better evaluation for multi-hop reasoning capabilities - the ability to combine multiple pieces of information into coherent inferences. Current benchmarks may not adequately test this ability, especially with controlled cultural variations and systematic difficulty levels.

Method: Developed a generative pipeline to produce large-scale, realistic, culture-specific genealogical data with explicit marriage constraints. From these genealogies, created textual inference tasks requiring reasoning over implicit relational chains. Evaluated six state-of-the-art LLMs (both open and closed-source) using uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding.

Result: KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings. Performance was measured using exact-match and set-based metrics, showing varying capabilities across different LLMs.

Conclusion: KinshipQA provides an effective benchmark for probing LLMs' multi-hop reasoning capabilities with controlled cultural variations and difficulty levels, revealing important differences in how models handle complex relational reasoning across different cultural contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, i.e., to combine multiple pieces of information into a coherent inference. We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.

### [142] [Learning Through Dialogue: Unpacking the Dynamics of Human-LLM Conversations on Political Issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07796)
*Shaz Furniturewala,Gerard Christopher Yeo,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM explanatory richness affects political knowledge and confidence differently: confidence gains come through reflective insight, knowledge gains through cognitive engagement, both moderated by users' political efficacy and interaction patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are increasingly used as conversational learning partners, there's limited understanding of how interactional dynamics between humans and LLMs actually support learning and engagement, particularly in socio-political contexts.

Method: Analyzed 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues, examining linguistic and interactional features from both sides. Used mediation analyses to identify mechanisms and moderation analyses to examine conditional effects based on political efficacy.

Result: LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence gains by fostering reflective insight, while its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through cognitive engagement. Effects are highly conditional: confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users handle uncertainty, while knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interactions.

Conclusion: Learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement rather than a uniform outcome of better explanations. Effective learning requires aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states, emphasizing the importance of designing Human-AI interactive systems that adapt to individual differences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as conversational partners for learning, yet the interactional dynamics supporting users' learning and engagement are understudied. We analyze the linguistic and interactional features from both LLM and participant chats across 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which LLM explanations shape changes in political knowledge and confidence. Mediation analyses reveal that LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence by fostering users' reflective insight, whereas its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through users' cognitive engagement. Moderation analyses show that these effects are highly conditional and vary by political efficacy. Confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users experience and resolve uncertainty. Knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interaction, with longer conversations benefiting primarily reflective users. In summary, we find that learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement, not a uniform outcome of better explanations. The findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states to support effective learning in designing Human-AI interactive systems.

*Ahmed Sabir,Markus Kängsepp,Rajesh Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how well LLMs' confidence scores align with human judgments of gender bias, introducing a new fairness-aware calibration metric called Gender-ECE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in sensitive domains, there's growing concern about whether their confidence scores reflect fairness and bias issues. The study aims to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs, particularly focusing on gender bias.

Method: The research investigates probability confidence calibration in gendered pronoun resolution contexts. It examines alignment between LLM-predicted confidence and human-annotated bias judgments, focusing on gender bias. The study evaluates six state-of-the-art models using calibration metrics.

Result: Among six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The research shows that calibration metrics can reveal fairness-related disparities in LLMs.

Conclusion: The primary contribution is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment. The paper introduces Gender-ECE, a new calibration metric designed to measure gender disparities in resolution tasks.

### [144] [Reference Games as a Testbed for the Alignment of Model Uncertainty and Clarification Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07820)
*Manar Ali,Judith Sieker,Sina Zarrieß,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vision-language models struggle to recognize their own uncertainty and request appropriate clarification in reference games, despite this being a fundamental conversational skill.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates whether language models can assume an active addressee role in conversation by recognizing and expressing their own uncertainty through clarification requests, similar to how humans maintain mutual understanding.

Method: The authors use reference games as a controlled testbed and evaluate three vision-language models. They compare baseline reference resolution tasks with experiments where models are instructed to request clarification when uncertain.

Result: Even in simple reference game tasks, models often fail to recognize internal uncertainty and translate it into adequate clarification behavior, demonstrating significant limitations in this fundamental conversational skill.

Conclusion: Reference games serve as valuable testbeds for evaluating interaction qualities of vision-language models, revealing that current models lack the ability to effectively recognize and express uncertainty through clarification requests.

Abstract: In human conversation, both interlocutors play an active role in maintaining mutual understanding. When addressees are uncertain about what speakers mean, for example, they can request clarification. It is an open question for language models whether they can assume a similar addressee role, recognizing and expressing their own uncertainty through clarification. We argue that reference games are a good testbed to approach this question as they are controlled, self-contained, and make clarification needs explicit and measurable. To test this, we evaluate three vision-language models comparing a baseline reference resolution task to an experiment where the models are instructed to request clarification when uncertain. The results suggest that even in such simple tasks, models often struggle to recognize internal uncertainty and translate it into adequate clarification behavior. This demonstrates the value of reference games as testbeds for interaction qualities of (vision and) language models.

### [145] [HyperTopo-Adapters: Geometry- and Topology-Aware Segmentation of Leaf Lesions on Frozen Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06067)
*Chimdi Walter Ndubuisi,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperTopo-Adapters: Lightweight adapters on frozen vision encoders that embed features on hyperbolic+Euclidean+spherical manifolds to improve topology-sensitive leaf-lesion segmentation, with topology priors and persistent homology metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pixel-wise losses in Euclidean latents weakly penalize small topological errors (merges, splits, false holes) that are biologically meaningful for leaf-lesion analysis. Need better topology preservation in segmentation.

Method: Train lightweight HyperTopo-Adapters on frozen vision encoders, embedding features on product manifold (H+E+S) for hierarchical separation, local linear detail, and global closure. Add topology prior with persistent homology distance for evaluation and differentiable surrogate (soft Euler-characteristic + TV regularization) for training. Use warm-ups, per-sample topology metrics, and min-PD within top-K Dice checkpoint selection.

Result: On Kaggle leaf-lesion dataset (N=2,940): consistent gains in boundary and topology metrics (reducing Delta beta_1 hole error by 9%) while maintaining competitive Dice/IoU. Diagnostic ablations show effects of curvature learning, latent dimensions, contrastive temperature, and surrogate settings.

Conclusion: Provides open, reproducible train/eval suite that isolates geometric/topological priors and surfaces failure modes to guide stronger topology-preserving architectures for medical/biological segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Leaf-lesion segmentation is topology-sensitive: small merges, splits, or false holes can be biologically meaningful descriptors of biochemical pathways, yet they are weakly penalized by standard pixel-wise losses in Euclidean latents. I explore HyperTopo-Adapters, a lightweight, parameter-efficient head trained on top of a frozen vision encoder, which embeds features on a product manifold -- hyperbolic + Euclidean + spherical (H + E + S) -- to encourage hierarchical separation (H), local linear detail (E), and global closure (S). A topology prior complements Dice/BCE in two forms: (i) persistent-homology (PH) distance for evaluation and selection, and (ii) a differentiable surrogate that combines a soft Euler-characteristic match with total variation regularization for stable training. I introduce warm-ups for both the hyperbolic contrastive term and the topology prior, per-sample evaluation of structure-aware metrics (Boundary-F1, Betti errors, PD distance), and a min-PD within top-K Dice rule for checkpoint selection. On a Kaggle leaf-lesion dataset (N=2,940), early results show consistent gains in boundary and topology metrics (reducing Delta beta_1 hole error by 9%) while Dice/IoU remain competitive. The study is diagnostic by design: I report controlled ablations (curvature learning, latent dimensions, contrastive temperature, surrogate settings), and ongoing tests varying encoder strength (ResNet-50, DeepLabV3, DINOv2/v3), input resolution, PH weight, and partial unfreezing of late blocks. The contribution is an open, reproducible train/eval suite (available at https://github.com/ChimdiWalter/HyperTopo-Adapters) that isolates geometric/topological priors and surfaces failure modes to guide stronger, topology-preserving architectures.

TL;DR: OptFormer: A novel encoder-decoder model for Sea Surface Temperature prediction that integrates phase-space reconstruction with motion-aware attention guided by optical flow, achieving superior performance on NOAA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SST prediction is crucial for climate modeling and disaster forecasting but remains challenging due to nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and extended prediction horizons. Existing methods struggle with capturing long-range temporal dependencies and dynamic spatial changes effectively.

Method: OptFormer combines phase-space reconstruction with a motion-aware attention mechanism guided by optical flow. Unlike conventional attention, it leverages inter-frame motion cues to highlight relative changes in spatial fields, allowing focus on dynamic regions and better capture of long-range temporal dependencies.

Result: Experiments on NOAA SST datasets across multiple spatial scales show OptFormer achieves superior performance under 1:1 training-to-prediction setting, significantly outperforming existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: OptFormer effectively addresses SST prediction challenges by integrating phase-space reconstruction with motion-aware attention, demonstrating improved capability to handle nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and long-range dependencies for more accurate and robust predictions.

### [147] [Semantic Event Graphs for Long-Form Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06097)
*Aradhya Dixit,Tianxi Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEG uses symbolic event graphs to enable efficient long-form video QA, reducing tokens by 91% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with hour-scale videos due to token/compute limits, forcing trade-offs between temporal coverage and cost.

Method: Detect/track objects with YOLOv11, convert proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, organize into Temporal Scene Graph, then prune query-relevant subgraph for verbalization and Gemini 2.5 Flash generation.

Result: 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, matching full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) with 91.4% token reduction. Short-context baseline collapses to 2.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: Symbolic temporal graphs serve as effective plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf VLMs, enabling long-range reasoning while being token/cost-efficient for long-form video QA.

Abstract: Long-form video question answering remains challenging for modern vision-language models, which struggle to reason over hour-scale footage without exceeding practical token and compute budgets. Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient. Code, logs, and event-extraction tools will be released for reproducibility.

*Canming Xia,Peixi Peng,Guang Tan,Zhan Su,Haoran Xu,Zhenxian Liu,Luntong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COVR is a collaborative optimization framework that enables mutual enhancement between vision-language models and reinforcement learning policies through fine-tuning VLMs with RL-generated data and using enhanced VLMs to guide policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL suffers from poor sample efficiency due to high-dimensional observations. Existing works focus on knowledge distillation from VLMs to RL but overlook the potential of RL-generated interaction data to enhance VLMs, creating a one-way relationship rather than mutual enhancement.

Method: COVR fine-tunes VLMs with RL-generated data to enhance semantic reasoning aligned with target tasks, then uses enhanced VLMs to guide policy learning via action priors. Key modules include: Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter (preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds) and Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight (improves training stability by quantifying action inconsistency via RL return signals). Also uses progressive fine-tuning to reduce resource consumption.

Result: Extensive experiments show COVR achieves strong performance across various challenging visual control tasks, demonstrating effectiveness of the collaborative optimization approach.

Conclusion: The proposed COVR framework enables mutual enhancement between VLMs and RL policies, addressing sample efficiency issues in visual RL through collaborative optimization that leverages RL-generated data to improve VLMs and enhanced VLMs to guide policy learning.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from poor sample efficiency due to high-dimensional observations in complex tasks. While existing works have shown that vision-language models (VLMs) can assist RL, they often focus on knowledge distillation from the VLM to RL, overlooking the potential of RL-generated interaction data to enhance the VLM. To address this, we propose COVR, a collaborative optimization framework that enables the mutual enhancement of the VLM and RL policies. Specifically, COVR fine-tunes the VLM with RL-generated data to enhance the semantic reasoning ability consistent with the target task, and uses the enhanced VLM to further guide policy learning via action priors. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL. We further design a progressive fine-tuning strategy to reduce resource consumption. Extensive experiments show that COVR achieves strong performance across various challenging visual control tasks.

*Kaiyuan Deng,Bo Hui,Gen Li,Jie Ji,Minghai Qin,Geng Yuan,Xiaolong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIA is a training-free, plug-and-play framework for multi-concept unlearning in diffusion models that uses model sparsity to identify and prune concept-specific neurons while preserving general content generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate copyrighted, inappropriate, or sensitive content learned from training data. Existing unlearning methods struggle with multi-concept removal, facing challenges in effectiveness, generation quality, and hyperparameter sensitivity.

Method: FIA uses Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify weight contributions, identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons via temporal-spatial analysis, constructs concept-specific masks, and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask that prunes target concepts while preserving general generation neurons.

Result: Extensive experiments across three unlearning tasks show FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning with improved forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality.

Conclusion: FIA provides a practical, training-free solution for multi-concept unlearning that requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, enabling a plug-and-play paradigm for removing unwanted concepts from diffusion models.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has raised concerns about their potential to generate copyrighted, inappropriate, or sensitive imagery learned from massive training corpora. As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm. Extensive experiments across three distinct unlearning tasks demonstrate that FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning, improving forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality.

TL;DR: HAERAE-Vision benchmark reveals VLMs struggle with real-world underspecified queries, with query explicitation boosting performance by 8-22 points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real user queries are often informal and underspecified, relying on images for context, but current vision-language benchmarks feature well-structured, explicit questions, creating a gap between evaluation and real-world deployment.

Method: Created HAERAE-Vision benchmark with 653 real-world visual questions from Korean online communities (filtered from 86K candidates), each paired with an explicit rewrite, totaling 1,306 query variants. Evaluated 39 VLMs including state-of-the-art models.

Result: Even top models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieve under 50% on original queries. Query explicitation alone yields 8-22 point improvements, with smaller models benefiting most. Web search cannot compensate for underspecified queries.

Conclusion: Substantial VLM difficulty stems from natural query underspecification rather than model capability, highlighting critical gap between benchmark evaluation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Current vision-language benchmarks predominantly feature well-structured questions with clear, explicit prompts. However, real user queries are often informal and underspecified. Users naturally leave much unsaid, relying on images to convey context. We introduce HAERAE-Vision, a benchmark of 653 real-world visual questions from Korean online communities (0.76% survival from 86K candidates), each paired with an explicit rewrite, yielding 1,306 query variants in total. Evaluating 39 VLMs, we find that even state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieve under 50% on the original queries. Crucially, query explicitation alone yields 8 to 22 point improvements, with smaller models benefiting most. We further show that even with web search, under-specified queries underperform explicit queries without search, revealing that current retrieval cannot compensate for what users leave unsaid. Our findings demonstrate that a substantial portion of VLM difficulty stem from natural query under-specification instead of model capability, highlighting a critical gap between benchmark evaluation and real-world deployment.

TL;DR: B-FIRE is a binning-free diffusion implicit neural representation framework for hyper-accelerated 4D MRI reconstruction that captures instantaneous 3D abdominal anatomy without motion blurring artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4DMRI produces acceptable artifacts for averaged breathing phases but blurs and misrepresents instantaneous dynamic information. There's a need for a new paradigm to reconstruct extremely undersampled non-Cartesian k-space data to recover accurate instantaneous motion information.

Method: B-FIRE uses a CNN-INR encoder-decoder backbone optimized with diffusion and comprehensive loss functions enforcing image-domain fidelity and frequency-aware constraints. Training uses motion-binned image pairs as references, while inference is performed on binning-free undersampled data.

Result: Experiments on T1-weighted StarVIBE liver MRI with accelerations from RV8 to RV1 show B-FIRE outperforms direct NuFFT, GRASP-CS, and unrolled CNN methods in reconstruction fidelity, motion trajectory consistency, and inference latency.

Conclusion: B-FIRE enables hyper-accelerated 4D MRI reconstruction that accurately reflects instantaneous 3D abdominal anatomy without motion blurring, addressing limitations of existing methods for dynamic motion resolution applications.

Abstract: Accelerated dynamic volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4DMRI) is essential for applications relying on motion resolution. Existing 4DMRI produces acceptable artifacts of averaged breathing phases, which can blur and misrepresent instantaneous dynamic information. Recovery of such information requires a new paradigm to reconstruct extremely undersampled non-Cartesian k-space data. We propose B-FIRE, a binning-free diffusion implicit neural representation framework for hyper-accelerated MR reconstruction capable of reflecting instantaneous 3D abdominal anatomy. B-FIRE employs a CNN-INR encoder-decoder backbone optimized using diffusion with a comprehensive loss that enforces image-domain fidelity and frequency-aware constraints. Motion binned image pairs were used as training references, while inference was performed on binning-free undersampled data. Experiments were conducted on a T1-weighted StarVIBE liver MRI cohort, with accelerations ranging from 8 spokes per frame (RV8) to RV1. B-FIRE was compared against direct NuFFT, GRASP-CS, and an unrolled CNN method. Reconstruction fidelity, motion trajectory consistency, and inference latency were evaluated.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes MNIST handwritten digits using PCA, Factor Analysis, and UMAP to reveal their low-dimensional structure, showing complementary insights into global variance, interpretable primitives, and nonlinear manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the latent organization and structure of handwritten digits in MNIST dataset beyond classification accuracy, focusing on intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry.

Method: Three dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for global variance, Factor Analysis (FA) for interpretable latent primitives, and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for nonlinear manifolds.

Result: PCA shows dominant global variance directions enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with few components. FA reveals interpretable handwriting primitives (strokes, loops, symmetry). UMAP uncovers nonlinear manifolds with smooth stylistic transitions between digit classes.

Conclusion: Handwritten digits occupy a structured low-dimensional manifold, and different statistical frameworks expose complementary aspects of this structure, providing a comprehensive understanding of digit organization beyond classification.

Abstract: Handwritten digit images lie in a high-dimensional pixel space but exhibit strong geometric and statistical structure. This paper investigates the latent organization of handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using three complementary dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Rather than focusing on classification accuracy, we study how each method characterizes intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry. PCA reveals dominant global variance directions and enables high-fidelity reconstructions using a small number of components. FA decomposes digits into interpretable latent handwriting primitives corresponding to strokes, loops, and symmetry. UMAP uncovers nonlinear manifolds that reflect smooth stylistic transitions between digit classes. Together, these results demonstrate that handwritten digits occupy a structured low-dimensional manifold and that different statistical frameworks expose complementary aspects of this structure.

*Zhiyong Ma,Zhenpeng Li,Yuanjie Shi,Zhengping Li,Jiahao Chen,Qingyuan Chuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBDN is a training-free framework that addresses compliance failure and prior-dominated hallucination in Text-to-Image In-Context Learning through two closed-loop mechanisms: Hint Instruction and Query Contrastive Decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Image In-Context Learning faces two mutually reinforcing bottlenecks: compliance failure (models not following examples) and prior-dominated hallucination (models relying too much on pre-trained knowledge), creating a vicious cycle that degrades generation quality. Existing methods require tailored training, limiting flexibility and increasing deployment costs.

Method: TBDN integrates two complementary training-free mechanisms: 1) Hint Instruction (HI) - uses lightweight prompt engineering to inject task-aware inductive bias, anchoring models on contextual mapping rules to mitigate compliance failure; 2) Query Contrastive Decoding (QCD) - adjusts language model decoding distributions by contrasting full-input and query-omitted distributions to suppress prior-dominated hallucination.

Result: TBDN achieves State-of-the-Art performance on CoBSAT and Text-to-Image Fast Mini-ImageNet benchmarks, with robust generalization across model backbones, prompt designs, and hyperparameters. It also maintains promising performance in concept preservation and prompt following on Dreambench++.

Conclusion: By breaking the two bottlenecks of compliance failure and prior-dominated hallucination, TBDN establishes a simple yet effective training-free framework for efficient and reliable Text-to-Image In-Context Learning.

Abstract: Text-to-Image In-Context Learning (T2I-ICL) enables customized image synthesis via interleaved text-image examples but faces two mutually reinforcing bottlenecks, compliance failure and prior-dominated hallucination, that form a vicious cycle degrading generation quality. Existing methods rely on tailored training, which limits flexibility and raises deployment costs. To address these challenges effectively, we propose TBDN, a training-free framework integrating two complementary closed-loop mechanisms: Hint Instruction (HI) and Query Contrastive Decoding (QCD). HI injects task-aware inductive bias via lightweight prompt engineering to anchor models on contextual mapping rules, thereby mitigating compliance failure. QCD adjusts the decoding distributions of language models by contrasting full-input and query-omitted distributions, suppressing prior-dominated hallucination. TBDN achieves State-of-the-Art performance on CoBSAT and Text-to-Image Fast Mini-ImageNet, with robust generalization across model backbones, prompt designs, and hyperparameters. It also maintains promising performance in concept preservation and prompt following on Dreambench++. By breaking the two bottlenecks, TBDN establishes a simple yet effective framework for efficient and reliable T2I-ICL.

*Hongbo Jin,Siyi Xie,Jiayu Ding,Kuanwei Lin,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIR-Flow is a novel framework that enables frozen Video-LLMs to perform active video searching and reasoning without additional data or parameter updates, achieving significant performance improvements on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs have strong perception but weak reasoning capabilities. Existing approaches rely on heavy data engineering (synthesizing CoT datasets + SFT + RL) which optimizes sampling efficiency but fails to activate intrinsic intelligence for dynamic visual exploration.

Method: TIR-Flow introduces three synergistic modules: HDD (decomposes complex queries into verifiable sub-tasks), HAP (actively directs visual attention to gather high-resolution evidence for hypothesis validation), and EBA (maintains a persistent workspace to accumulate and update discovered clues for logical reasoning).

Result: Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show TIR-Flow significantly outperforms recent strong baselines with average performance boost of 5.9%, reaching 10.5% improvement on Egoschema.

Conclusion: Empowering frozen VLMs with System-2-like active perception is a scalable path toward solving long-horizon video reasoning without additional data or parameter updates.

Abstract: While Large Video-Language Models (Video-LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in perception, their reasoning capabilities remain a bottleneck. Existing solutions typically resort to a heavy "data engineering" paradigm-synthesizing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This pipeline primarily optimizes probability sampling efficiency and aligns output distributions, but fails to activate the intrinsic intelligence required for dynamic visual exploration. In this work, we propose TIR-Flow, a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from passive processing to active video searching and reasoning without additional data or parameter updating. Concretely, our framework operates through three synergistic modules: HDD decomposes complex queries into a set of verifiable sub-tasks; HAP actively directs visual attention to gather high-resolution evidence for hypothesis validation; EBA maintains a persistent workspace to accumulate and update the discovered clues for logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TIR-Flow significantly outperforms recent strong baselines, delivering an average performance boost of 5.9%, with gains reaching 10.5% on Egoschema. Our analysis confirms that empowering frozen VLMs with System-2-like active perception is a scalable path toward solving long-horizon video reasoning.

Conclusion: A single Attention U-Net model can effectively segment tumors across different imaging modalities (MRI/CT) and anatomical sites (brain/lung), providing a simpler and more generalizable approach compared to modality-specific models or complex domain adaptation methods.

Abstract: This study presents a unified Attention U-Net architecture trained jointly on MRI (BraTS 2021) and CT (LIDC-IDRI) datasets to investigate the generalizability of a single model across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical sites. Our proposed pipeline incorporates modality-harmonized preprocessing, attention-gated skip connections, and a modality-aware Focal Tversky loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to evaluate a single Attention U-Net trained simultaneously on separate MRI (BraTS) and CT (LIDC-IDRI) tumor datasets, without relying on modality-specific encoders or domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video understanding methods fail to capture fine-grained, multimodal, and culturally grounded differences in procedural cooking videos, despite the growing availability of online cooking videos that offer unprecedented potential to study culinary variations systematically.

Method: A multi-stage framework leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) to segment videos into fine-grained procedural units, align them with audio transcripts and canonical recipe text, and a video comparison pipeline that automatically identifies and explains procedural differences between regional variants. The approach employs multiple VLMs in complementary roles with human-in-the-loop verification.

Conclusion: The dataset, comparison methodology, and QA benchmark provide a new testbed for evaluating VLMs on structured, multimodal reasoning tasks and open new directions for computational analysis of cultural heritage through cooking videos.

Abstract: Biryani, one of India's most celebrated dishes, exhibits remarkable regional diversity in its preparation, ingredients, and presentation. With the growing availability of online cooking videos, there is unprecedented potential to study such culinary variations using computational tools systematically. However, existing video understanding methods fail to capture the fine-grained, multimodal, and culturally grounded differences in procedural cooking videos. This work presents the first large-scale, curated dataset of biryani preparation videos, comprising 120 high-quality YouTube recordings across 12 distinct regional styles. We propose a multi-stage framework leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) to segment videos into fine-grained procedural units and align them with audio transcripts and canonical recipe text. Building on these aligned representations, we introduce a video comparison pipeline that automatically identifies and explains procedural differences between regional variants. We construct a comprehensive question-answer (QA) benchmark spanning multiple reasoning levels to evaluate procedural understanding in VLMs. Our approach employs multiple VLMs in complementary roles, incorporates human-in-the-loop verification for high-precision tasks, and benchmarks several state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The resulting dataset, comparison methodology, and QA benchmark provide a new testbed for evaluating VLMs on structured, multimodal reasoning tasks and open new directions for computational analysis of cultural heritage through cooking videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascading multi-agent framework for intelligent anomaly detection that combines reconstruction-based filtering, object-level assessment, and selective high-level reasoning to achieve real-time performance with semantic interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection approaches are fragmented: reconstruction models lack contextual reasoning, object detectors have limited semantics, and vision-language systems are computationally expensive. There's a need to unify real-time performance with semantic interpretability in dynamic visual environments.

Method: A cascading multi-agent framework with early modules for reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, plus higher-level reasoning agents selectively invoked for ambiguous events. Uses adaptive escalation thresholds and publish-subscribe communication for asynchronous coordination across heterogeneous hardware.

Result: Achieves 3x latency reduction compared to direct vision-language inference while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling on large-scale monitoring data.

Conclusion: The framework advances anomaly detection by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.

Abstract: Intelligent anomaly detection in dynamic visual environments requires reconciling real-time performance with semantic interpretability. Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.

### [160] [When Imbalance Comes Twice: Active Learning under Simulated Class Imbalance and Label Shift in Binary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06209)
*Julien Combes,Alexandre Derville,Jean-François Coeurjolly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active learning remains effective for imbalanced datasets with defect detection, but suffers from label shift due to storage constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In machine vision applications like defect detection, most images are defect-free (class imbalance) and storage limitations prevent keeping all images (causing label shift). Understanding how these imbalances affect active learning algorithms is crucial for practical deployment.

Method: Simulation study using two open-source datasets with controlled levels of class imbalance and label shift. Three active learning strategies compared: random sampling, entropy-based selection, and core-set selection.

Result: Active learning strategies (especially entropy-based and core-set selections) remain efficient even for highly imbalanced datasets. However, strong label shift causes significant efficiency loss in active learning performance.

Conclusion: Active learning is robust to class imbalance in defect detection scenarios but vulnerable to label shift from storage constraints, highlighting the need to consider both factors in practical applications.

Abstract: The aim of Active Learning is to select the most informative samples from an unlabelled set of data. This is useful in cases where the amount of data is large and labelling is expensive, such as in machine vision or medical imaging. Two particularities of machine vision are first, that most of the images produced are free of defects, and second, that the amount of images produced is so big that we cannot store all acquired images. This results, on the one hand, in a strong class imbalance in defect distribution and, on the other hand, in a potential label shift caused by limited storage. To understand how these two forms of imbalance affect active learning algorithms, we propose a simulation study based on two open-source datasets. We artificially create datasets for which we control the levels of class imbalance and label shift. Three standard active learning selection strategies are compared: random sampling, entropy-based selection, and core-set selection. We demonstrate that active learning strategies, and in particular the entropy-based and core-set selections, remain interesting and efficient even for highly imbalanced datasets. We also illustrate and measure the loss of efficiency that occurs in the situation a strong label shift.

*Xinghao Wang,Changtao Miao,Dianmo Sheng,Tao Gong,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu,Quanchen Zou,Deyue Zhang,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAPL uses CLIP with semantic-agnostic prompt learning to localize image manipulations without pixel-level annotations by focusing on boundary cues rather than object semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manipulation localization methods require expensive pixel-level annotations, while weakly supervised methods using only image-level labels overlook critical local edge cues needed for precise localization.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP with two modules: Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) generates text prompts encoding boundary cues via attention, and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) uses contrastive learning to discriminate between genuine and manipulated edge patches.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art localization performance.

Conclusion: SAPL effectively addresses the limitations of existing weakly supervised methods by leveraging edge information in both textual and visual spaces, enabling precise manipulation localization without costly pixel-level annotations.

Abstract: Malicious image manipulation threatens public safety and requires efficient localization methods. Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes hallucination causes in MLLMs during RL training and proposes a three-module framework to address over-reliance on chained reasoning, insufficient exploration, and sample interference via NTK similarity regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from severe hallucination issues during RL optimization, hindering practical deployment. The paper aims to systematically analyze root causes and develop solutions to reduce hallucinations and improve inference accuracy.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Enhanced visual localization with planning/captioning stages before reasoning, using quality-based caption reward; 2) Exploration improvement by categorizing samples based on reward distribution mean/variance, prioritizing high-variance samples; 3) Sample interference mitigation via NTK similarity regulation using grouping and InfoNCE loss to balance gradient interactions.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces hallucination rates and effectively enhances the inference accuracy of MLLMs.

Conclusion: The comprehensive framework addresses key hallucination causes in MLLMs during RL training, providing systematic solutions for improved model reliability and practical deployment.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, their practical deployment is severely hindered by hallucination issues, which become particularly acute during Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization. This paper systematically analyzes the root causes of hallucinations in MLLMs under RL training, identifying three critical factors: (1) an over-reliance on chained visual reasoning, where inaccurate initial descriptions or redundant information anchor subsequent inferences to incorrect premises; (2) insufficient exploration diversity during policy optimization, leading the model to generate overly confident but erroneous outputs; and (3) destructive conflicts between training samples, where Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) similarity causes false associations and unstable parameter updates. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising three core modules. First, we enhance visual localization by introducing dedicated planning and captioning stages before the reasoning phase, employing a quality-based caption reward to ensure accurate initial anchoring. Second, to improve exploration, we categorize samples based on the mean and variance of their reward distributions, prioritizing samples with high variance to focus the model on diverse and informative data. Finally, to mitigate sample interference, we regulate NTK similarity by grouping sample pairs and applying an InfoNCE loss to push overly similar pairs apart and pull dissimilar ones closer, thereby guiding gradient interactions toward a balanced range. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces hallucination rates and effectively enhances the inference accuracy of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity and low diversity of well-annotated automotive radar datasets limit deep-learning-based environmental perception performance, creating a need for synthetic radar data generation.

Method: Proposes a conditional generative diffusion model for synthesizing Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar Range-Azimuth Maps. Uses Confidence Maps for semantic conditioning (pedestrians, cars, cyclists), incorporates Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization to address radar-specific characteristics.

Result: Signal reconstruction quality improves by 3.6 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods. Training with real+synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared to conventional image-processing-based augmentation.

Conclusion: The generative framework produces physically plausible and diverse radar spectrum while substantially improving model generalization in downstream perception tasks.

Abstract: The scarcity and low diversity of well-annotated automotive radar datasets often limit the performance of deep-learning-based environmental perception. To overcome these challenges, we propose a conditional generative framework for synthesizing realistic Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar Range-Azimuth Maps. Our approach leverages a generative diffusion model to generate radar data for multiple object categories, including pedestrians, cars, and cyclists. Specifically, conditioning is achieved via Confidence Maps, where each channel represents a semantic class and encodes Gaussian-distributed annotations at target locations. To address radar-specific characteristics, we incorporate Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization into the generative process. Experiments on the ROD2021 dataset demonstrate that signal reconstruction quality improves by \SI{3.6}{dB} in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods, while training with a combination of real and synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared with conventional image-processing-based augmentation. These results indicate that our generative framework not only produces physically plausible and diverse radar spectrum but also substantially improves model generalization in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: This survey offers a thorough review of face recognition methods and applications, providing experimental results and detailed discussion to help researchers understand current approaches and challenges in the field.

Abstract: As multimedia content is quickly growing, the field of facial recognition has become one of the major research fields, particularly in the recent years. The most problematic area to researchers in image processing and computer vision is the human face which is a complex object with myriads of distinctive features that can be used to identify the face. The survey of this survey is particularly focused on most challenging facial characteristics, including differences in the light, ageing, variation in poses, partial occlusion, and facial expression and presents methodological solutions. The factors, therefore, are inevitable in the creation of effective facial recognition mechanisms used on facial images. This paper reviews the most sophisticated methods of facial detection which are Hidden Markov Models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Elastic Cluster Plot Matching, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gabor Waves, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Eigenfaces, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and 3D Morphable Model. Alongside the works mentioned above, we have also analyzed the images of a number of facial databases, namely JAFEE, FEI, Yale, LFW, AT&T (then called ORL), and AR (created by Martinez and Benavente), to analyze the results. However, this survey is aimed at giving a thorough literature review of face recognition, and its applications, and some experimental results are provided at the end after a detailed discussion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a lightweight, open-source solution for webcam-based gaze estimation that can be used in browser-based experimental platforms and real-world cognitive/clinical research, addressing the need for low-cost, scalable gaze tracking without specialized hardware.

Method: EyeTheia combines MediaPipe-based facial landmark extraction with a convolutional neural network inspired by iTracker architecture.

The system includes optional lightweight user-specific fine-tuning for calibration.

Result: Validation on MPIIFaceGaze shows comparable performance between both approaches before calibration. User-specific fine-tuning consistently reduces gaze prediction error.

Conclusion: EyeTheia provides a transparent, extensible, and low-cost gaze tracking solution suitable for scalable and reproducible experimental and clinical studies. The open-source availability of code, models, and materials supports broader adoption and research reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce EyeTheia, a lightweight and open deep learning pipeline for webcam-based gaze estimation, designed for browser-based experimental platforms and real-world cognitive and clinical research. EyeTheia enables real-time gaze tracking using only a standard laptop webcam, combining MediaPipe-based landmark extraction with a convolutional neural network inspired by iTracker and optional user-specific fine-tuning. We investigate two complementary strategies: adapting a model pretrained on mobile data and training the same architecture from scratch on a desktop-oriented dataset. Validation results on MPIIFaceGaze show comparable performance between both approaches prior to calibration, while lightweight user-specific fine-tuning consistently reduces gaze prediction error. We further evaluate EyeTheia in a realistic Dot-Probe task and compare it to the commercial webcam-based tracker SeeSo SDK. Results indicate strong agreement in left-right gaze allocation during stimulus presentation, despite higher temporal variability. Overall, EyeTheia provides a transparent and extensible solution for low-cost gaze tracking, suitable for scalable and reproducible experimental and clinical studies. The code, trained models, and experimental materials are publicly available.

TL;DR: NAS-GS: A noise-aware Gaussian splatting framework for underwater sonar imaging that improves 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis through two-way splatting and GMM-based noise modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater sonar imaging is crucial for autonomous navigation, marine archaeology, and environmental monitoring, but sonar images have unique challenges like complex noise patterns and lack of elevation information that make 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis difficult.

Method: Proposes NAS-GS with: 1) Two-Ways Splatting technique that models dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation to improve rendering speed, and 2) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns (side-lobes, speckle, multi-path noise) to prevent 3D Gaussian overfitting.

Conclusion: NAS-GS effectively addresses the unique challenges of sonar imaging through innovative two-way splatting and noise modeling, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis for underwater applications.

Abstract: Underwater sonar imaging plays a crucial role in various applications, including autonomous navigation in murky water, marine archaeology, and environmental monitoring. However, the unique characteristics of sonar images, such as complex noise patterns and the lack of elevation information, pose significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. In this paper, we present NAS-GS, a novel Noise-Aware Sonar Gaussian Splatting framework specifically designed to address these challenges. Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality. Moreover, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns, including side-lobes, speckle, and multi-path noise. This model enhances the realism of synthesized images while preventing 3D Gaussian overfitting to noise, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real-world large-scale offshore sonar scenarios, achieving superior results in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: Perception Test 2025 benchmarked multimodal video models through unified task interfaces, revealing significant challenges for current SOTA models in handling diverse perception tasks via unified approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure progress in multimodal perception, with emphasis on task unification as a more challenging test for current models.

Method: Organized as ICCV 2025 workshop with five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object/point tracking, unified action/sound localization, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA. Introduced novel subset reformulating traditional perception tasks as multiple-choice video QA questions.

Result: The challenge highlighted significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces, requiring competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models.

Conclusion: Perception Test 2025 demonstrates that current multimodal models struggle with unified task interfaces, emphasizing the need for more versatile and integrated approaches to diverse perception tasks.

Abstract: The Third Perception Test challenge was organised as a full-day workshop alongside the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025. Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces.

TL;DR: VideoWeave improves video-language model training efficiency by splicing short captioned videos into synthetic long-context samples instead of modifying architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training video-language models is expensive due to processing long frame sequences and limited annotated long videos. Need more efficient training methods.

Method: Construct synthetic long-context training samples by splicing together short, captioned videos from existing datasets. Study different data composition strategies like random vs visually clustered splicing and caption enrichment.

Result: Under identical compute constraints, models trained with VideoWeave achieve higher accuracy than conventional video finetuning on downstream video question answering.

Conclusion: Reorganizing training data rather than altering architectures offers a simple and scalable path for training video-language models.

Abstract: Training video-language models is often prohibitively expensive due to the high cost of processing long frame sequences and the limited availability of annotated long videos. We present VideoWeave, a simple yet effective approach to improve data efficiency by constructing synthetic long-context training samples that splice together short, captioned videos from existing datasets. Rather than modifying model architectures or optimization objectives, VideoWeave reorganizes available video-text pairs to expand temporal diversity within fixed compute. We systematically study how different data composition strategies like random versus visually clustered splicing and caption enrichment affect downstream performance on downstream video question answering. Under identical compute constraints, models trained with VideoWeave achieve higher accuracy than conventional video finetuning. Our results highlight that reorganizing training data, rather than altering architectures, may offer a simple and scalable path for training video-language models. We link our code for all experiments here.

*Saksham Singh Kushwaha,Sayan Nag,Yapeng Tian,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-WIPER is a training-free framework that removes dynamic objects and their visual effects from videos using pre-trained diffusion transformers, achieving temporally coherent inpainting without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video object removal methods struggle with removing associated visual effects (like shadows, reflections) and maintaining temporal coherence without extensive retraining. There's also a lack of suitable evaluation metrics for this task.

Method: Uses pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Localizes objects/effects via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. Creates effect mask fused with user mask. Inverts video to structured noise, reinitializes masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, copies saved background token values to maintain scene fidelity.

Result: Outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines on DAVIS and new WIPER-Bench dataset. Achieves clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining. Introduces new evaluation metric for object removal.

Conclusion: Object-WIPER provides an effective training-free solution for removing dynamic objects and their visual effects from videos while maintaining temporal coherence and scene fidelity, with new benchmark and metrics for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Object-WIPER, a training-free framework for removing dynamic objects and their associated visual effects from videos, and inpainting them with semantically consistent and temporally coherent content. Our approach leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Given an input video, a user-provided object mask, and query tokens describing the target object and its effects, we localize relevant visual tokens via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. This produces an intermediate effect mask that we fuse with the user mask to obtain a final foreground token mask to replace. We first invert the video through the DiT to obtain structured noise, then reinitialize the masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, we copy values for the background tokens saved during inversion to maintain scene fidelity. To address the lack of suitable evaluation, we introduce a new object removal metric that rewards temporal consistency among foreground tokens across consecutive frames, coherence between foreground and background tokens within each frame, and dissimilarity between the input and output foreground tokens. Experiments on DAVIS and a newly curated real-world associated effect benchmark (WIPER-Bench) show that Object-WIPER surpasses both training-based and training-free baselines in terms of the metric, achieving clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining. Our new benchmark, source code, and pre-trained models will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage framework using vision-language models and large language models for few-shot student engagement prediction from video, incorporating classroom context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require substantial annotated data and ignore classroom context/peer actions, while privacy concerns limit data sharing across institutions.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Few-shot adaptation of vision-language model for student action recognition, 2) Sliding temporal window segmentation of videos with action prediction, 3) Large language model classification of action sequences with classroom context for engagement/disengagement.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness in identifying student engagement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses data scarcity and context limitations for student engagement measurement using few-shot learning and contextual analysis.

Abstract: Understanding student behavior in the classroom is essential to improve both pedagogical quality and student engagement. Existing methods for predicting student engagement typically require substantial annotated data to model the diversity of student behaviors, yet privacy concerns often restrict researchers to their own proprietary datasets. Moreover, the classroom context, represented in peers' actions, is ignored. To address the aforementioned limitation, we propose a novel three-stage framework for video-based student engagement measurement. First, we explore the few-shot adaptation of the vision-language model for student action recognition, which is fine-tuned to distinguish among action categories with a few training samples. Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments. Each segment is assigned an action category via the fine-tuned VLM model, generating a sequence of action predictions. Finally, we leverage the large language model to classify this entire sequence of actions, together with the classroom context, as belonging to an engaged or disengaged student. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying student engagement.

*Yueming Pan,Ruoyu Feng,Jianmin Bao,Chong Luo,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlobalPaint is a diffusion-based framework for video outpainting that ensures spatiotemporal coherence through hierarchical processing, enhanced 3D attention, and global feature guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video outpainting requires both spatial plausibility and long-range temporal coherence, especially when outpainted content becomes visible over time due to camera or object motion. Existing methods struggle with maintaining temporal consistency across frames.

Method: Hierarchical pipeline: first outpaints key frames, then completes intermediate frames via interpolation conditioned on completed boundaries. Uses pretrained image inpainting backbone enhanced with: (1) Enhanced Spatial-Temporal module with 3D windowed attention for spatiotemporal interaction, (2) global feature guidance that distills OpenCLIP features from observed regions into compact global tokens.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate improved reconstruction quality and more natural motion compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: GlobalPaint effectively addresses spatiotemporal coherence in video outpainting through its hierarchical approach and enhanced architecture, outperforming existing methods in both quality and motion naturalness.

Abstract: Video outpainting extends a video beyond its original boundaries by synthesizing missing border content. Compared with image outpainting, it requires not only per-frame spatial plausibility but also long-range temporal coherence, especially when outpainted content becomes visible across time under camera or object motion. We propose GlobalPaint, a diffusion-based framework for spatiotemporal coherent video outpainting. Our approach adopts a hierarchical pipeline that first outpaints key frames and then completes intermediate frames via an interpolation model conditioned on the completed boundaries, reducing error accumulation in sequential processing. At the model level, we augment a pretrained image inpainting backbone with (i) an Enhanced Spatial-Temporal module featuring 3D windowed attention for stronger spatiotemporal interaction, and (ii) global feature guidance that distills OpenCLIP features from observed regions across all frames into compact global tokens using a dedicated extractor. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate improved reconstruction quality and more natural motion compared to prior methods.

TL;DR: WHU-PCPR is a new cross-platform heterogeneous point cloud dataset for place recognition, addressing limitations of existing datasets by including diverse platforms (MLS and PLS), sensors, and complex real-world scenes over 82.3km trajectory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud place recognition (PCPR) datasets lack diversity in scenes, platforms, and sensors, limiting research development. Real-world applications involve point clouds from different platforms and LiDARs across varying scenes.

Method: Created WHU-PCPR dataset with: 1) cross-platform heterogeneous point clouds from survey-grade vehicle-mounted MLS and low-cost portable helmet-mounted PLS systems with different mechanical and solid-state LiDARs, 2) complex urban and campus scenes with real-time and long-term changes, 3) large-scale coverage (82.3km trajectory over 60 months, ~30km unrepeated route).

Conclusion: WHU-PCPR addresses critical gaps in PCPR research by providing diverse, realistic data for developing robust place recognition systems. The dataset enables better evaluation and advancement of PCPR methods for real-world applications like autonomous driving and robot navigation.

Abstract: Point Cloud-based Place Recognition (PCPR) demonstrates considerable potential in applications such as autonomous driving, robot localization and navigation, and map update. In practical applications, point clouds used for place recognition are often acquired from different platforms and LiDARs across varying scene. However, existing PCPR datasets lack diversity in scenes, platforms, and sensors, which limits the effective development of related research. To address this gap, we establish WHU-PCPR, a cross-platform heterogeneous point cloud dataset designed for place recognition. The dataset differentiates itself from existing datasets through its distinctive characteristics: 1) cross-platform heterogeneous point clouds: collected from survey-grade vehicle-mounted Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems and low-cost Portable helmet-mounted Laser Scanning (PLS) systems, each equipped with distinct mechanical and solid-state LiDAR sensors. 2) Complex localization scenes: encompassing real-time and long-term changes in both urban and campus road scenes. 3) Large-scale spatial coverage: featuring 82.3 km of trajectory over a 60-month period and an unrepeated route of approximately 30 km. Based on WHU-PCPR, we conduct extensive evaluation and in-depth analysis of several representative PCPR methods, and provide a concise discussion of key challenges and future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing interest in using computer vision to systematically characterize neighborhood built environments for health research, but uncertainty exists about model generalizability across domains (ImageNet to GSV), appropriate model selection, unsupervised training strategies, computational constraints, and downstream performance benefits.

Method: The authors conduct empirical analysis comparing model performance before and after unsupervised adaptation, providing practical insights for selecting and adapting foundation models for datasets with limited size and labels while leveraging larger unlabeled datasets through unsupervised training.

Result: The paper includes comprehensive quantitative and visual analyses comparing model performance, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for social health researchers on how to effectively adapt computer vision models for neighborhood built environment analysis, addressing key challenges in domain transfer and model selection for applied research contexts.

Abstract: A substantial body of health research demonstrates a strong link between neighborhood environments and health outcomes. Recently, there has been increasing interest in leveraging advances in computer vision to enable large-scale, systematic characterization of neighborhood built environments. However, the generalizability of vision models across fundamentally different domains remains uncertain, for example, transferring knowledge from ImageNet to the distinct visual characteristics of Google Street View (GSV) imagery. In applied fields such as social health research, several critical questions arise: which models are most appropriate, whether to adopt unsupervised training strategies, what training scale is feasible under computational constraints, and how much such strategies benefit downstream performance. These decisions are often costly and require specialized expertise.
  In this paper, we answer these questions through empirical analysis and provide practical insights into how to select and adapt foundation models for datasets with limited size and labels, while leveraging larger, unlabeled datasets through unsupervised training. Our study includes comprehensive quantitative and visual analyses comparing model performance before and after unsupervised adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs hallucinate under different prompt pressures, with Ghost-100 dataset showing hallucination rates don't increase monotonically with prompt intensity, revealing safety alignment gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are used in safety-critical applications but often hallucinate details. Existing benchmarks focus on object presence/absence, leaving prompt phrasing and structural constraints insufficiently studied.

Method: Created Ghost-100 dataset with synthetic scenes where key visual details are removed. Used 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework (neutral to toxic demands) to evaluate three open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B.

Result: Hallucination rates don't increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models show reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, but not all sustain reduction under maximum coercion.

Conclusion: Current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications that require reliable visual grounding. However, these models often hallucinate details that are not present in the image to satisfy user prompts. While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

*Chao Liu,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First systematic study of adversarial robustness in 3D Vision-Language Models reveals significant vulnerabilities to untargeted attacks but greater resilience to targeted attacks compared to 2D VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D VLMs show strong reasoning abilities, their adversarial robustness remains unexplored. Given that 2D VLMs become more vulnerable when integrating visual inputs, the paper investigates whether 3D vision similarly compromises 3D VLM robustness, especially important for safety-critical applications.

Method: Proposes two complementary attack strategies: Vision Attack (perturbs visual token features from 3D encoder/projector to test vision-language alignment) and Caption Attack (directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end robustness). Each includes untargeted and targeted variants.

Result: 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, but demonstrate greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs compared to their 2D counterparts.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of improving adversarial robustness of 3D VLMs, particularly as they are deployed in safety-critical applications where manipulation could lead to toxic or misleading outputs.

Abstract: 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as PointLLM and GPT4Point, have shown strong reasoning and generalization abilities in 3D understanding tasks. However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. Prior work in 2D VLMs has shown that the integration of visual inputs significantly increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks, making these models easier to manipulate into generating toxic or misleading outputs. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating 3D vision similarly compromises the robustness of 3D VLMs. To this end, we present the first systematic study of adversarial robustness in point-based 3D VLMs. We propose two complementary attack strategies: \textit{Vision Attack}, which perturbs the visual token features produced by the 3D encoder and projector to assess the robustness of vision-language alignment; and \textit{Caption Attack}, which directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end system robustness. Each attack includes both untargeted and targeted variants to measure general vulnerability and susceptibility to controlled manipulation. Our experiments reveal that 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, while demonstrating greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs, compared to their 2D counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of improving the adversarial robustness of 3D VLMs, especially as they are deployed in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseOccVLA is a vision-language-action model that bridges VLMs and semantic occupancy using sparse occupancy queries for unified scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems face a gap between high-level reasoning from Vision Language Models (VLMs) and fine-grained details from semantic occupancy. VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy is too dense for efficient VLM integration.

Method: Proposes SparseOccVLA with: 1) Sparse Occupancy Encoder generating compact sparse occupancy queries as bridge between vision and language, 2) LLM reasoning on aligned queries for scene understanding and occupancy forecasting, 3) LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner with decoupled anchor scoring/denoising and trajectory-condition fusion.

Result: Achieves 7% relative improvement in CIDEr on OmniDrive-nuScenes, 0.5 increase in mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark.

Conclusion: SparseOccVLA effectively bridges VLMs and semantic occupancy, demonstrating strong holistic capabilities for autonomous driving through unified scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level reasoning , whereas semantic occupancy provides fine-grained details. Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability.

*Kai Cheng,Ruoqi Wang,Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VVTRec is a multimodal reconstruction method for radio astronomy that transforms sparse visibility data into image and text features, using VLMs to enhance image quality without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only use single-modality sparse visibility data, resulting in images with artifacts and insufficient correlation modeling. There's a need to better extract visibility information and improve output quality in the image domain.

Method: VVTRec transforms sparse visibility data into image-form and text-form features to enhance spatial and semantic information. It leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for training-free performance improvements, allowing visibility data to extract pre-trained knowledge from VLMs as a supplement.

Result: VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead, improving structural integrity and accuracy of reconstructed images.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment successfully addresses limitations of single-modality methods, providing cleaner radio astronomy images through better information extraction and VLM integration.

Abstract: Radio astronomy is an indispensable discipline for observing distant celestial objects. Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement. Our experiments demonstrate that VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead.

TL;DR: SRFlow introduces a high-resolution facial optical flow dataset and SRFlowNet model with tailored regularization losses, achieving significant improvements in facial optical flow estimation and micro-expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-resolution facial optical flow datasets has hindered progress in facial motion analysis, particularly for capturing detailed skin motion needed for tasks like micro-expression recognition.

Method: Created SRFlow dataset and SRFlowNet model with tailored regularization losses using masks and gradients (difference or Sobel operator) to suppress noise in texture-less/repetitive-pattern regions, enabling high-resolution skin motion capture guided by Gaussian splatting rasterization.

Result: Training with SRFlow dataset reduces end-point error by up to 42% (0.5081 to 0.2953) across various optical flow models. SRFlowNet with SRFlow dataset achieves up to 48% F1-score improvement (0.4733 to 0.6947) on micro-expression datasets.

Conclusion: The SRFlow dataset and SRFlowNet model advance both facial optical flow estimation and micro-expression recognition, demonstrating the value of high-resolution facial motion analysis.

Abstract: Facial optical flow supports a wide range of tasks in facial motion analysis. However, the lack of high-resolution facial optical flow datasets has hindered progress in this area. In this paper, we introduce Splatting Rasterization Flow (SRFlow), a high-resolution facial optical flow dataset, and Splatting Rasterization Guided FlowNet (SRFlowNet), a facial optical flow model with tailored regularization losses. These losses constrain flow predictions using masks and gradients computed via difference or Sobel operator. This effectively suppresses high-frequency noise and large-scale errors in texture-less or repetitive-pattern regions, enabling SRFlowNet to be the first model explicitly capable of capturing high-resolution skin motion guided by Gaussian splatting rasterization. Experiments show that training with the SRFlow dataset improves facial optical flow estimation across various optical flow models, reducing end-point error (EPE) by up to 42% (from 0.5081 to 0.2953). Furthermore, when coupled with the SRFlow dataset, SRFlowNet achieves up to a 48% improvement in F1-score (from 0.4733 to 0.6947) on a composite of three micro-expression datasets. These results demonstrate the value of advancing both facial optical flow estimation and micro-expression recognition.

TL;DR: Zero-shot framework transfers human facial expressions to 3D animal faces using disentangled latent spaces, trained only on human data without requiring animal expression data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable cross-species facial expression transfer from humans to animals without needing paired animal expression data, which is difficult to obtain.

Method: Combines intrinsic geometric descriptors (HKS/WKS) with mesh-agnostic latent embedding that disentangles facial identity and expression. Uses ID latent space for species-independent facial structure and expression latent space for deformation patterns. Employs Jacobian loss with vertex-position and Laplacian losses for geometric consistency.

Result: Achieves plausible cross-species expression transfer, effectively narrowing the geometric gap between human and animal facial shapes.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables zero-shot expression transfer from humans to animals using only human training data, demonstrating generalization across species.

Abstract: We present a zero-shot framework for transferring human facial expressions to 3D animal face meshes. Our method combines intrinsic geometric descriptors (HKS/WKS) with a mesh-agnostic latent embedding that disentangles facial identity and expression. The ID latent space captures species-independent facial structure, while the expression latent space encodes deformation patterns that generalize across humans and animals. Trained only with human expression pairs, the model learns the embeddings, decoupling, and recoupling of cross-identity expressions, enabling expression transfer without requiring animal expression data. To enforce geometric consistency, we employ Jacobian loss together with vertex-position and Laplacian losses. Experiments show that our approach achieves plausible cross-species expression transfer, effectively narrowing the geometric gap between human and animal facial shapes.

*Hao Tang,Ting Huang,Zeyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D CoCa v2 improves 3D scene captioning with better generalization across indoor/outdoor environments using contrastive learning and test-time search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D captioning methods struggle with weak grounding and poor out-of-distribution generalization across different 3D environments due to sparse, irregular point clouds.

Method: Unifies contrastive vision-language learning with 3D caption generation using frozen CLIP-based semantic prior, spatially-aware 3D encoder, and multimodal decoder. Adds test-time search for reward-guided caption selection.

Result: Improves over 3D CoCa by +1.50 CIDEr@0.5IoU on ScanRefer, +1.61 CIDEr@0.5IoU on Nr3D, and +3.8 CIDEr@0.25 in zero-shot OOD evaluation on TOD3Cap.

Conclusion: 3D CoCa v2 provides a generalizable 3D captioning framework that achieves better performance and robustness across diverse environments without parameter updates during inference.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, reason about, and describe objects and their relationships within three-dimensional environments, forming a foundation for embodied perception and scene understanding. 3D captioning aims to describe 3D scenes in natural language; however, it remains challenging due to the sparsity and irregularity of point clouds and, more critically, the weak grounding and limited out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of existing captioners across drastically different environments, including indoor and outdoor 3D scenes. To address this challenge, we propose 3D CoCa v2, a generalizable 3D captioning framework that unifies contrastive vision-language learning with 3D caption generation and further improves robustness via test-time search (TTS) without updating the captioner parameters. 3D CoCa v2 builds on a frozen CLIP-based semantic prior, a spatially-aware 3D scene encoder for geometry, and a multimodal decoder jointly optimized with contrastive and captioning objectives, avoiding external detectors or handcrafted proposals. At inference, TTS produces diverse caption candidates and performs reward-guided selection using a compact scene summary. Experiments show improvements over 3D CoCa of +1.50 CIDEr@0.5IoU on ScanRefer and +1.61 CIDEr@0.5IoU on Nr3D, and +3.8 CIDEr@0.25 in zero-shot OOD evaluation on TOD3Cap.

### [183] [Bridging Robustness and Efficiency: Real-Time Low-Light Enhancement via Attention U-Net GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06518)
*Yash Thesia,Meera Suthar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid Attention U-Net GAN achieves diffusion-level texture recovery with 40x faster inference (0.06s vs 2-4s), bridging the gap between perceptual quality and computational efficiency in low-light image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLIE methods face a trade-off: diffusion models offer high perceptual quality but slow inference (2-4s), while CNN baselines are fast but suffer from over-smoothing and poor texture recovery. There's a need for models that combine generative-level texture recovery with edge-deployable speeds.

Method: Proposes a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN that integrates Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone trained within a conditional adversarial framework. This approach approximates diffusion models' high-frequency fidelity in a single forward pass without iterative sampling.

Result: Achieves best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models on SID dataset, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN). Maintains inference latency of 0.06s, representing 40x speedup over latent diffusion models.

Conclusion: Heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. The proposed hybrid Attention U-Net GAN successfully bridges the efficiency-quality gap, enabling near real-time applications with generative-level texture recovery.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) have focused heavily on Diffusion Probabilistic Models, which achieve high perceptual quality but suffer from significant computational latency (often exceeding 2-4 seconds per image). Conversely, traditional CNN-based baselines offer real-time inference but struggle with "over-smoothing," failing to recover fine structural details in extreme low-light conditions. This creates a practical gap in the literature: the lack of a model that provides generative-level texture recovery at edge-deployable speeds. In this paper, we address this trade-off by proposing a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN. We demonstrate that the heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. Instead, by integrating Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone and training within a conditional adversarial framework, we can approximate the high-frequency fidelity of generative models in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on the SID dataset show that our method achieves a best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN) while maintaining an inference latency of 0.06s. This represents a 40x speedup over latent diffusion models, making our approach suitable for near real-time applications.

TL;DR: MLLMs fail basic visual tasks that young children can solve, revealing a gap in core visual abilities independent of language. BabyVision benchmark shows leading models perform significantly below human baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While humans develop core visual skills before language acquisition, current MLLMs rely heavily on linguistic priors to compensate for weak visual understanding. The authors discovered that state-of-the-art MLLMs consistently fail on basic visual tasks that even 3-year-olds can solve effortlessly, highlighting a fundamental gap in visual perception capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce BabyVision, a benchmark designed to assess core visual abilities independent of linguistic knowledge for MLLMs. The benchmark spans 388 items divided into 22 subclasses across four key categories. They also propose BabyVision-Gen and an automatic evaluation toolkit for solving visual reasoning with generation models.

Result: Empirical results show leading MLLMs perform significantly below human baselines. Gemini3-Pro-Preview scores only 49.7, lagging behind 6-year-old humans and falling well behind the average adult score of 94.1. Despite excelling in knowledge-heavy evaluations, current MLLMs lack fundamental visual primitives.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs still lack fundamental visual perception capabilities that humans develop early in life. Progress on BabyVision represents a step toward achieving human-level visual perception and reasoning. The benchmark and code are publicly released to facilitate reproduction and further research.

Abstract: While humans develop core visual skills long before acquiring language, contemporary Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still rely heavily on linguistic priors to compensate for their fragile visual understanding. We uncovered a crucial fact: state-of-the-art MLLMs consistently fail on basic visual tasks that humans, even 3-year-olds, can solve effortlessly. To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce BabyVision, a benchmark designed to assess core visual abilities independent of linguistic knowledge for MLLMs. BabyVision spans a wide range of tasks, with 388 items divided into 22 subclasses across four key categories. Empirical results and human evaluation reveal that leading MLLMs perform significantly below human baselines. Gemini3-Pro-Preview scores 49.7, lagging behind 6-year-old humans and falling well behind the average adult score of 94.1. These results show despite excelling in knowledge-heavy evaluations, current MLLMs still lack fundamental visual primitives. Progress in BabyVision represents a step toward human-level visual perception and reasoning capabilities. We also explore solving visual reasoning with generation models by proposing BabyVision-Gen and automatic evaluation toolkit.

### [185] [Toward Generalizable Deblurring: Leveraging Massive Blur Priors with Linear Attention for Real-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06525)
*Yuanting Gao,Shuo Cao,Xiaohui Li,Yuandong Pu,Yihao Liu,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLOWDeblur is a lightweight deblurring model that addresses poor generalization in deep learning methods by using Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP) to learn diverse blur patterns from simulation data and transferring them to real-world applications, enhanced by Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) for severe degradation cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning deblurring methods suffer from poor generalization beyond their training datasets due to two limitations: datasets trade off realism vs. blur pattern diversity, and algorithmic designs focus too much on local detail recovery while neglecting structural/semantic consistency. Diffusion models also fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets.

Method: Proposes Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP) to learn blur priors from simulation datasets and transfer them via joint fine-tuning on real data. Introduces Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) to strengthen blur priors under severe degradation. GLOWDeblur combines convolution-based pre-reconstruction & domain alignment with a lightweight diffusion backbone.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks and two real-world datasets validate the approach, confirming blur pattern diversity is crucial for robust generalization. The lightweight design of GLOWDeblur ensures practical real-world applicability.

Conclusion: Blur pattern diversity is the decisive factor for robust generalization in deblurring. The proposed BPP and MoSeG approach enables effective transfer learning from simulation to real data, and GLOWDeblur's lightweight design makes it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Image deblurring has advanced rapidly with deep learning, yet most methods exhibit poor generalization beyond their training datasets, with performance dropping significantly in real-world scenarios. Our analysis shows this limitation stems from two factors: datasets face an inherent trade-off between realism and coverage of diverse blur patterns, and algorithmic designs remain restrictive, as pixel-wise losses drive models toward local detail recovery while overlooking structural and semantic consistency, whereas diffusion-based approaches, though perceptually strong, still fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets with simplistic strategies. Through systematic investigation, we identify blur pattern diversity as the decisive factor for robust generalization and propose Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP), which acquires blur priors from simulation datasets and transfers them through joint fine-tuning on real data. We further introduce Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) to strengthen blur priors under severe degradation, and integrate it into GLOWDeblur, a Generalizable reaL-wOrld lightWeight Deblur model that combines convolution-based pre-reconstruction & domain alignment module with a lightweight diffusion backbone. Extensive experiments on six widely-used benchmarks and two real-world datasets validate our approach, confirming the importance of blur priors for robust generalization and demonstrating that the lightweight design of GLOWDeblur ensures practicality in real-world applications.

*Wiktor Mucha,Michael Wray,Martin Kampel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-HPOT improves cross-domain 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images by using virtual camera space normalization and self-supervised test-time optimization, achieving significant error reductions without requiring target domain annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D hand pose estimation methods perform well within the same domain but struggle to generalize to new environments due to limited training data and overfitting to specific camera intrinsics, which hinders cross-domain performance.

Method: V-HPOT estimates keypoint z-coordinates in a virtual camera space normalized by focal length and image size for camera-agnostic depth prediction. It then uses a self-supervised test-time optimization strategy with a 3D consistency loss between predicted and scale-transformed hand poses to adapt to target domains without ground truth annotations.

Result: V-HPOT achieves 71% reduction in mean pose error on H2O dataset and 41% reduction on AssemblyHands dataset. It outperforms all single-stage approaches and competes closely with two-stage methods while requiring 3.5x to 14x less data.

Conclusion: V-HPOT effectively addresses cross-domain generalization challenges in 3D hand pose estimation through camera-agnostic depth prediction and self-supervised test-time optimization, enabling robust performance across diverse unseen domains with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: We present V-HPOT, a novel approach for improving the cross-domain performance of 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images across diverse, unseen domains. State-of-the-art methods demonstrate strong performance when trained and tested within the same domain. However, they struggle to generalise to new environments due to limited training data and depth perception -- overfitting to specific camera intrinsics. Our method addresses this by estimating keypoint z-coordinates in a virtual camera space, normalised by focal length and image size, enabling camera-agnostic depth prediction. We further leverage this invariance to camera intrinsics to propose a self-supervised test-time optimisation strategy that refines the model's depth perception during inference. This is achieved by applying a 3D consistency loss between predicted and in-space scale-transformed hand poses, allowing the model to adapt to target domain characteristics without requiring ground truth annotations. V-HPOT significantly improves 3D hand pose estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios, achieving a 71% reduction in mean pose error on the H2O dataset and a 41% reduction on the AssemblyHands dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, V-HPOT outperforms all single-stage approaches across all datasets and competes closely with two-stage methods, despite needing approximately x3.5 to x14 less data.

*Pan Liao,Feng Yang,Di Wu,Jinwen Yu,Yuhua Zhu,Wenhui Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMTrack is a novel Semantic Multi-Object Tracking framework that combines geometric tracking with semantic understanding using multimodal large language models to answer not just "where" and "who" but also "what" and "why" about object behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOT systems only track geometric paths (where and who) but lack semantic understanding of object behaviors (what and why). There's a gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning that needs to be bridged for more intelligent tracking systems.

Method: Uses a bionic design with Grounding DINO for localization (eyes) and LLaVA-OneVision multimodal LLM for understanding (brain). Features a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module for aggregating interaction features and video contexts, plus a progressive three-stage training strategy (Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, Semantic Injection via LoRA).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BenSMOT benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.

Conclusion: LLMTrack successfully bridges geometric perception with cognitive reasoning, enabling semantic understanding of object behaviors beyond traditional tracking capabilities, representing a significant advancement in Semantic Multi-Object Tracking.

Abstract: Traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) systems have achieved remarkable precision in localization and association, effectively answering \textit{where} and \textit{who}. However, they often function as autistic observers, capable of tracing geometric paths but blind to the semantic \textit{what} and \textit{why} behind object behaviors. To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.

### [188] [ArrowGEV: Grounding Events in Video via Learning the Arrow of Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06559)
*Fangxu Yu,Ziyao Lu,Liqiang Niu,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArrowGEV is a reinforcement learning framework that improves video event grounding by explicitly modeling temporal directionality, inspired by physics' arrow of time concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models for video event grounding only train on forward videos, failing to capture inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, which limits robustness and generalization.

Method: ArrowGEV uses reinforcement learning to categorize events as time-sensitive (meaning changes with reversal) vs time-insensitive (meaning unchanged with reversal). For time-sensitive events, it rewards models for discriminating forward/backward videos; for time-insensitive events, it enforces consistent grounding across both directions.

Result: Extensive experiments show ArrowGEV improves grounding precision, temporal directionality recognition, and enhances general video understanding and reasoning ability.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling temporal directionality through the arrow of time concept significantly improves Vision-Language Models' event grounding capabilities and overall video understanding.

Abstract: Grounding events in videos serves as a fundamental capability in video analysis. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly employed for this task, existing approaches predominantly train models to associate events with timestamps in the forward video only. This paradigm hinders VLMs from capturing the inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, thereby limiting robustness and generalization. To address this limitation, inspired by the arrow of time in physics, which characterizes the intrinsic directionality of temporal processes, we propose ArrowGEV, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models temporal directionality in events to improve both event grounding and temporal directionality understanding in VLMs. Specifically, we categorize events into time-sensitive (e.g., putting down a bag) and time-insensitive (e.g., holding a towel in the left hand). The former denote events whose reversal substantially alters their meaning, while the latter remain semantically unchanged under reversal. For time-sensitive events, ArrowGEV introduces a reward that encourages VLMs to discriminate between forward and backward videos, whereas for time-insensitive events, it enforces consistent grounding across both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArrowGEV not only improves grounding precision and temporal directionality recognition, but also enhances general video understanding and reasoning ability.

TL;DR: APEX addresses multi-objective alignment instability in text-to-image generation by tackling variance hijacking and gradient conflicts through adaptive normalization and priority scheduling, achieving balanced improvements across heterogeneous objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static linear scalarization for multi-objective alignment in text-to-image generation fails under heterogeneous rewards, causing optimization imbalance where models overfit high-variance objectives (like OCR) while under-optimizing perceptual goals.

Method: APEX (Adaptive Priority-based Efficient X-objective Alignment) uses Dual-Stage Adaptive Normalization to stabilize heterogeneous rewards and P^3 Adaptive Priorities (combining learning potential, conflict penalty, and progress need) to dynamically schedule objectives.

Result: On Stable Diffusion 3.5, APEX achieves improved Pareto trade-offs across four heterogeneous objectives with balanced gains: +1.31 PickScore, +0.35 DeQA, +0.53 Aesthetics while maintaining competitive OCR accuracy.

Conclusion: APEX effectively mitigates the instability of multi-objective alignment in text-to-image generation by addressing mechanistic causes of optimization imbalance through adaptive normalization and priority-based scheduling.

Abstract: Multi-objective alignment for text-to-image generation is commonly implemented via static linear scalarization, but fixed weights often fail under heterogeneous rewards, leading to optimization imbalance where models overfit high-variance, high-responsiveness objectives (e.g., OCR) while under-optimizing perceptual goals. We identify two mechanistic causes: variance hijacking, where reward dispersion induces implicit reweighting that dominates the normalized training signal, and gradient conflicts, where competing objectives produce opposing update directions and trigger seesaw-like oscillations. We propose APEX (Adaptive Priority-based Efficient X-objective Alignment), which stabilizes heterogeneous rewards with Dual-Stage Adaptive Normalization and dynamically schedules objectives via P^3 Adaptive Priorities that combine learning potential, conflict penalty, and progress need. On Stable Diffusion 3.5, APEX achieves improved Pareto trade-offs across four heterogeneous objectives, with balanced gains of +1.31 PickScore, +0.35 DeQA, and +0.53 Aesthetics while maintaining competitive OCR accuracy, mitigating the instability of multi-objective alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style transfer methods require task-specific retraining or expensive inversion procedures, compromising content integrity and style fidelity while struggling with semantic prompt adherence vs. style alignment trade-offs.

Method: Reformulates style-guided synthesis as in-context learning task; concatenates reference style image with masked target image; uses pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model with multimodal attention fusion; introduces Dynamic Semantic-Style Integration (DSSI) mechanism to reweight attention between textual semantic and style visual tokens.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity stylization with superior semantic-style balance and visual quality; outperforms complex, artifact-prone prior methods.

Conclusion: Proposes simple yet powerful training-free alternative for precise image stylization that effectively resolves guidance conflicts and enhances output coherence.

Abstract: Text-guided image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale diffusion models, yet achieving precise stylization with visual exemplars remains difficult. Existing approaches often depend on task-specific retraining or expensive inversion procedures, which can compromise content integrity, reduce style fidelity, and lead to an unsatisfactory trade-off between semantic prompt adherence and style alignment. In this work, we introduce a training-free framework that reformulates style-guided synthesis as an in-context learning task. Guided by textual semantic prompts, our method concatenates a reference style image with a masked target image, leveraging a pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model to seamlessly integrate semantic content with the desired style through multimodal attention fusion. We further analyze the imbalance and noise sensitivity inherent in multimodal attention fusion and propose a Dynamic Semantic-Style Integration (DSSI) mechanism that reweights attention between textual semantic and style visual tokens, effectively resolving guidance conflicts and enhancing output coherence. Experiments show that our approach achieves high-fidelity stylization with superior semantic-style balance and visual quality, offering a simple yet powerful alternative to complex, artifact-prone prior methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU) to address overlapping organoid segmentation in semi-supervised learning, achieving near-fully-supervised performance with only 10% labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organoid instance segmentation is crucial for medical research but limited by scarce annotated data and pervasive overlap in microscopy images. Semi-supervised learning suffers from noisy pseudo-labels in overlapping regions, causing intertwined organoids to be misrepresented as single entities.

Method: Proposes Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU) that identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. Uses contour-based synthesis for efficient organoid instance generation, particularly for overlapping cases. Applies instance-level augmentations on pseudo-labels before image synthesis to enhance synthetic data effectiveness.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, with state-of-the-art results on two organoid datasets. Ablation studies validate contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training.

Conclusion: By addressing overlap at both pseudo-label and synthesis levels, the work advances scalable, label-efficient organoid analysis, unlocking potential for high-throughput applications in precision medicine.

Abstract: Organoids, sophisticated in vitro models of human tissues, are crucial for medical research due to their ability to simulate organ functions and assess drug responses accurately. Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training. By addressing overlap at both pseudo-label and synthesis levels, our work advances scalable, label-efficient organoid analysis, unlocking new potential for high-throughput applications in precision medicine.

TL;DR: Event cameras outperform RGB for ski tracking in broadcast footage, achieving +20% IoU improvement in cluttered scenes with static overlays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB broadcast footage suffers from motion blur, static overlays, and clutter that obscure fast-moving skiers. Event cameras offer natural robustness to these artifacts, but there's no controlled benchmark for winter-sport tracking.

Method: Created eSkiTB, a synthetic event-based ski tracking dataset from SkiTB using direct video-to-event conversion without neural interpolation. Benchmarked SDTrack (spiking transformer) against STARK (RGB transformer).

Result: Event-based tracking is substantially resilient to broadcast clutter, achieving 0.685 IoU in scenes with static overlays (outperforming RGB by +20.0 points). SDTrack attains mean IoU of 0.711 across the dataset.

Conclusion: Temporal contrast is a reliable cue for tracking ballistic motion in visually congested environments. eSkiTB establishes the first controlled setting for event-based tracking in winter sports and highlights event cameras' promise for ski tracking.

Abstract: Tracking skiers in RGB broadcast footage is challenging due to motion blur, static overlays, and clutter that obscure the fast-moving athlete. Event cameras, with their asynchronous contrast sensing, offer natural robustness to such artifacts, yet a controlled benchmark for winter-sport tracking has been missing. We introduce event SkiTB (eSkiTB), a synthetic event-based ski tracking dataset generated from SkiTB using direct video-to-event conversion without neural interpolation, enabling an iso-informational comparison between RGB and event modalities. Benchmarking SDTrack (spiking transformer) against STARK (RGB transformer), we find that event-based tracking is substantially resilient to broadcast clutter in scenes dominated by static overlays, achieving 0.685 IoU, outperforming RGB by +20.0 points. Across the dataset, SDTrack attains a mean IoU of 0.711, demonstrating that temporal contrast is a reliable cue for tracking ballistic motion in visually congested environments. eSkiTB establishes the first controlled setting for event-based tracking in winter sports and highlights the promise of event cameras for ski tracking.

*Sanjay Pradeep,Chen Wang,Matthew M. Dahm,Jeff D. Eldredge,Candace S. J. Tsai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework using vision foundation models (SAM + DINOv2) automates CNT quantification and classification in electron microscopy with 95.5% accuracy, outperforming manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual segmentation of carbon nanotubes in electron microscopy is slow, subjective, and creates a bottleneck for exposure assessment and toxicological studies.

Method: Two-part framework: 1) Interactive quantification tool using Segment Anything Model (SAM) for near-perfect particle segmentation with minimal user input; 2) Classification pipeline using segmentation masks to spatially constrain DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features only from particle regions while suppressing background noise.

Result: Achieved 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four CNT morphologies on 1,800 TEM images, significantly outperforming current baseline with fraction of training data. Framework can resolve mixed samples by classifying distinct particle types within single field of view.

Conclusion: Integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming labor-intensive bottleneck into scalable, data-driven process.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of carbon nanotube morphologies in electron microscopy images is vital for exposure assessment and toxicological studies, yet current workflows rely on slow, subjective manual segmentation. This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.

### [195] [When Humans Judge Irises: Pupil Size Normalization as an Aid and Synthetic Irises as a Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06725)
*Mahsa Mitcheff,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human iris verification study shows pupil size normalization improves accuracy, and humans struggle to distinguish authentic vs. synthetic same-eye iris pairs despite high-quality generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While iris recognition is mature for large-scale deployments, forensic applications require human expert review, especially for degraded samples or presentation attack detection. This study examines human performance in iris verification under controlled scenarios to understand limitations and improve forensic applications.

Method: Two controlled scenarios: (1) varying pupil sizes with/without pupil size normalization using autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation, and (2) comparing genuine vs. impostor iris pairs using synthetically generated images. Human participants performed verification tasks in these scenarios.

Result: Pupil size normalization significantly improves human verification accuracy. Humans can determine same/different eyes when both images are authentic or synthetic, but accuracy declines when comparing authentic irises against high-quality same-eye synthetic counterparts. Synthetic same-eye images are more often judged as different-eye images compared to authentic same-eye pairs.

Conclusion: Pupil-size alignment is crucial for human-involved iris matching tasks. Despite high fidelity of modern generative models, humans struggle to recognize same-eye synthetic images as matches, indicating limitations in synthetic iris generation for forensic applications. Data and human judgments are provided for replicability.

Abstract: Iris recognition is a mature biometric technology offering remarkable precision and speed, and allowing for large-scale deployments to populations exceeding a billion enrolled users (e.g., AADHAAR in India). However, in forensic applications, a human expert may be needed to review and confirm a positive identification before an iris matching result can be presented as evidence in court, especially in cases where processed samples are degraded (e.g., in post-mortem cases) or where there is a need to judge whether the sample is authentic, rather than a result of a presentation attack.
  This paper presents a study that examines human performance in iris verification in two controlled scenarios: (a) under varying pupil sizes, with and without a linear/nonlinear alignment of the pupil size between compared images, and (b) when both genuine and impostor iris image pairs are synthetically generated. The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.
  We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works.

*Shaonan Liu,Guo Yu,Xiaoling Luo,Shiyi Zheng,Wenting Chen,Jie Liu,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedGaze-Bench is the first benchmark using clinician gaze as a "Cognitive Cursor" to evaluate medical multimodal LLMs' egocentric clinical intent understanding across surgery, emergency simulation, and diagnostic interpretation, addressing visual homogeneity, temporal dependencies, and safety protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate the critical capability of egocentric clinical intent understanding required for real-world deployment of Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs).

Method: Introduces MedGaze-Bench leveraging clinician gaze as a Cognitive Cursor, with a Three-Dimensional Clinical Intent Framework evaluating: (1) Spatial Intent for precise target discrimination, (2) Temporal Intent for causal rationale inference through retrospective/prospective reasoning, and (3) Standard Intent for protocol compliance verification. Includes Trap QA mechanisms to stress-test clinical reliability.

Result: Experiments reveal current MLLMs struggle with egocentric intent due to over-reliance on global features, leading to fabricated observations and uncritical acceptance of invalid instructions.

Conclusion: MedGaze-Bench addresses fundamental challenges in evaluating Med-MLLMs' clinical intent understanding and reveals critical limitations in current models that must be addressed for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) require egocentric clinical intent understanding for real-world deployment, yet existing benchmarks fail to evaluate this critical capability. To address these challenges, we introduce MedGaze-Bench, the first benchmark leveraging clinician gaze as a Cognitive Cursor to assess intent understanding across surgery, emergency simulation, and diagnostic interpretation. Our benchmark addresses three fundamental challenges: visual homogeneity of anatomical structures, strict temporal-causal dependencies in clinical workflows, and implicit adherence to safety protocols. We propose a Three-Dimensional Clinical Intent Framework evaluating: (1) Spatial Intent: discriminating precise targets amid visual noise, (2) Temporal Intent: inferring causal rationale through retrospective and prospective reasoning, and (3) Standard Intent: verifying protocol compliance through safety checks. Beyond accuracy metrics, we introduce Trap QA mechanisms to stress-test clinical reliability by penalizing hallucinations and cognitive sycophancy. Experiments reveal current MLLMs struggle with egocentric intent due to over-reliance on global features, leading to fabricated observations and uncritical acceptance of invalid instructions.

### [197] [The Normalized Difference Layer: A Differentiable Spectral Index Formulation for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06777)
*Ali Lotfi,Adam Carter,Mohammad Meysami,Thuan Ha,Kwabena Nketia,Steve Shirtliffe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable Normalized Difference Layer that learns band coefficients from data while preserving the benefits of traditional normalized difference indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional normalized difference indices in remote sensing are fixed with coefficients set to one, limiting their adaptability to specific learning tasks. The authors aim to create a more flexible approach that maintains the benefits of normalized differences while allowing data-driven coefficient optimization.

Method: The authors propose a differentiable neural network module called the Normalized Difference Layer. It uses softplus reparameterization to ensure positive coefficients and bounded denominators, with forward and backward pass algorithms enabling end-to-end training through backpropagation. The method extends to work with signed inputs so the layer can be stacked in larger architectures.

Result: Models using the Normalized Difference Layer achieve similar classification accuracy to standard multilayer perceptrons while using about 75% fewer parameters. They also handle multiplicative noise well, with only 0.17% accuracy drop at 10% noise versus 3.03% drop for baseline MLPs. The learned coefficient patterns remain consistent across different network depths.

Conclusion: The Normalized Difference Layer successfully combines the classical benefits of normalized difference indices (illumination invariance, bounded outputs) with the flexibility of learned coefficients, creating more parameter-efficient and noise-robust models for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Normalized difference indices have been a staple in remote sensing for decades. They stay reliable under lighting changes produce bounded values and connect well to biophysical signals. Even so, they are usually treated as a fixed pre processing step with coefficients set to one, which limits how well they can adapt to a specific learning task. In this study, we introduce the Normalized Difference Layer that is a differentiable neural network module. The proposed method keeps the classical idea but learns the band coefficients from data. We present a complete mathematical framework for integrating this layer into deep learning architectures that uses softplus reparameterization to ensure positive coefficients and bounded denominators. We describe forward and backward pass algorithms enabling end to end training through backpropagation. This approach preserves the key benefits of normalized differences, namely illumination invariance and outputs bounded to $[-1,1]$ while allowing gradient descent to discover task specific band weightings. We extend the method to work with signed inputs, so the layer can be stacked inside larger architectures. Experiments show that models using this layer reach similar classification accuracy to standard multilayer perceptrons while using about 75\% fewer parameters. They also handle multiplicative noise well, at 10\% noise accuracy drops only 0.17\% versus 3.03\% for baseline MLPs. The learned coefficient patterns stay consistent across different depths.

### [198] [CliffordNet: All You Need is Geometric Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06793)
*Zhongping Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CliffordNet proposes a vision backbone based purely on Geometric Algebra, replacing heuristic modules with unified geometric product operations that achieve state-of-the-art efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the conventional paradigm of stacking heuristic modules (spatial mixers + channel mixers) in modern vision architectures, arguing for a return to mathematical first principles using Geometric Algebra.

Method: Proposes Clifford Algebra Network (CAN/CliffordNet) using the Clifford Geometric Product (uv = u·v + u∧v) as a unified interaction mechanism that simultaneously captures feature coherence (inner product) and structural variation (wedge product). Implemented with efficient sparse rolling mechanism achieving linear O(N) complexity.

Result: CliffordNet establishes new Pareto frontier: Nano variant achieves 76.41% accuracy on CIFAR-100 with only 1.4M parameters (8× fewer than ResNet-18's 11.2M), Base variant sets new SOTA for tiny models at 78.05%. The geometric interaction is so dense that FFNs become redundant.

Conclusion: Global understanding can emerge from rigorous, algebraically complete local geometric interactions, suggesting a potential paradigm shift where "geometry is all you need" for vision tasks.

Abstract: Modern computer vision architectures, from CNNs to Transformers, predominantly rely on the stacking of heuristic modules: spatial mixers (Attention/Conv) followed by channel mixers (FFNs). In this work, we challenge this paradigm by returning to mathematical first principles. We propose the \textbf{Clifford Algebra Network (CAN)}, also referred to as CliffordNet, a vision backbone grounded purely in Geometric Algebra. Instead of engineering separate modules for mixing and memory, we derive a unified interaction mechanism based on the \textbf{Clifford Geometric Product} ($uv = u \cdot v + u \wedge v$). This operation ensures algebraic completeness regarding the Geometric Product by simultaneously capturing feature coherence (via the generalized inner product) and structural variation (via the exterior wedge product).
  Implemented via an efficient sparse rolling mechanism with \textbf{strict linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(N)$}, our model reveals a surprising emergent property: the geometric interaction is so representationally dense that standard Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) become redundant. Empirically, CliffordNet establishes a new Pareto frontier: our \textbf{Nano} variant achieves \textbf{76.41\%} accuracy on CIFAR-100 with only \textbf{1.4M} parameters, effectively matching the heavy-weight ResNet-18 (11.2M) with \textbf{$8\times$ fewer parameters}, while our \textbf{Base} variant sets a new SOTA for tiny models at \textbf{78.05\%}. Our results suggest that global understanding can emerge solely from rigorous, algebraically complete local interactions, potentially signaling a shift where \textit{geometry is all you need}.

*Jiwen Zhang,Zejun Li,Siyuan Wang,Xiangyu Shi,Zhongyu Wei,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialNav: A zero-shot VLN agent that builds Spatial Scene Graphs from pre-explored environments to capture global spatial structure, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot methods and narrowing the gap with learning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot VLN agents lack implicit spatial knowledge from training data, relying only on local observations which leads to inefficient exploration and poor performance compared to learning-based methods.

Method: 1) Allow full environment exploration before task execution; 2) Construct Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to capture global spatial structure and semantics; 3) Develop SpatialNav agent with agent-centric spatial map, compass-aligned visual representation, and remote object localization strategy.

Result: SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents in both discrete and continuous environments, and clearly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

Conclusion: Global spatial representations are crucial for generalizable navigation, and the proposed SSG-based approach effectively addresses the limitations of zero-shot VLN agents.

Abstract: Although learning-based vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents can learn spatial knowledge implicitly from large-scale training data, zero-shot VLN agents lack this process, relying primarily on local observations for navigation, which leads to inefficient exploration and a significant performance gap. To deal with the problem, we consider a zero-shot VLN setting that agents are allowed to fully explore the environment before task execution. Then, we construct the Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to explicitly capture global spatial structure and semantics in the explored environment. Based on the SSG, we introduce SpatialNav, a zero-shot VLN agent that integrates an agent-centric spatial map, a compass-aligned visual representation, and a remote object localization strategy for efficient navigation. Comprehensive experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents and clearly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Such results highlight the importance of global spatial representations for generalizable navigation.

### [200] [SARA: Scene-Aware Reconstruction Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06831)
*Jee Won Lee,Hansol Lim,Minhyeok Im,Dohyeon Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARA is a geometry-driven pair selection module for SfM that selects image pairs based on reconstruction informativeness (overlap × parallax) rather than visual similarity, achieving 98% pair reduction and 50x speedup while maintaining reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SfM pipelines select image pairs based on visual similarity alone, which leads to inefficient matching of many uninformative pairs. This quadratic complexity limits scalability and wastes computational resources on pairs that contribute little to reconstruction quality.

Method: SARA introduces geometry-first pair selection using a lightweight pre-matching stage with mutual nearest neighbors and RANSAC to estimate overlap and parallax. It computes reconstruction informativeness scores (overlap × parallax) and constructs an Information-Weighted Spanning Tree (IWST) augmented with targeted edges for loop closure, long-baseline anchors, and weak-view reinforcement.

Result: SARA reduces rotation errors by 46.5±5.5% and translation errors by 12.5±6.5% compared to exhaustive matching, achieves 98% pair reduction (from 30,848 to 580 pairs), and up to 50x speedup while maintaining within ±3% of baseline reconstruction metrics for downstream tasks like 3D Gaussian Splatting and SVRaster.

Conclusion: SARA demonstrates that geometry-driven pair selection based on reconstruction informativeness significantly outperforms visual similarity-based approaches, reducing matching complexity from quadratic to quasi-linear while improving reconstruction accuracy and enabling scalable SfM pipelines.

Abstract: We present SARA (Scene-Aware Reconstruction Accelerator), a geometry-driven pair selection module for Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Unlike conventional pipelines that select pairs based on visual similarity alone, SARA introduces geometry-first pair selection by scoring reconstruction informativeness - the product of overlap and parallax - before expensive matching. A lightweight pre-matching stage uses mutual nearest neighbors and RANSAC to estimate these cues, then constructs an Information-Weighted Spanning Tree (IWST) augmented with targeted edges for loop closure, long-baseline anchors, and weak-view reinforcement. Compared to exhaustive matching, SARA reduces rotation errors by 46.5+-5.5% and translation errors by 12.5+-6.5% across modern learned detectors, while achieving at most 50x speedup through 98% pair reduction (from 30,848 to 580 pairs). This reduces matching complexity from quadratic to quasi-linear, maintaining within +-3% of baseline reconstruction metrics for 3D Gaussian Splatting and SVRaster.

TL;DR: LR2Flow is a nonlinear framework that learns low-resolution image representations using wavelet tight frame blocks with normalizing flows, enabling efficient storage/transmission while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resolution image representation reduces storage and transmission costs but faces the challenge of preserving essential visual content while enabling accurate reconstruction of original images.

Method: Integrates wavelet tight frame blocks with normalizing flows to create an invertible neural network framework that learns low-resolution representations in the wavelet domain.

Result: Reconstruction error analysis demonstrates the necessity of invertible neural networks in wavelet tight frame domain. Experimental results show effectiveness in image rescaling, compression, and denoising tasks.

Conclusion: LR2Flow provides an effective and robust framework for learning low-resolution image representations that balance efficiency with reconstruction accuracy across multiple image processing applications.

Abstract: Low-resolution image representation is a special form of sparse representation that retains only low-frequency information while discarding high-frequency components. This property reduces storage and transmission costs and benefits various image processing tasks. However, a key challenge is to preserve essential visual content while maintaining the ability to accurately reconstruct the original images. This work proposes LR2Flow, a nonlinear framework that learns low-resolution image representations by integrating wavelet tight frame blocks with normalizing flows. We conduct a reconstruction error analysis of the proposed network, which demonstrates the necessity of designing invertible neural networks in the wavelet tight frame domain. Experimental results on various tasks, including image rescaling, compression, and denoising, demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned representations and the robustness of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel SAR-to-optical translation framework using cross-modal semantic alignment, semantically-grounded generative guidance, and uncertainty-aware objectives to overcome speckle noise and geometric distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR-to-optical translation is fundamentally ill-posed due to speckle noise and geometric distortions in SAR data, leading to semantic misinterpretation, ambiguous texture synthesis, and structural hallucinations in current approaches.

Method: Three core contributions: 1) Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment with Optical-Aware SAR Encoder using teacher-student distillation, 2) Semantically-Grounded Generative Guidance via ControlNet with class-aware text prompts and hierarchical visual prompts, 3) Uncertainty-Aware Objective modeling aleatoric uncertainty to dynamically modulate reconstruction focus.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses SAR-to-optical translation challenges by integrating semantic alignment, generative guidance, and uncertainty modeling to mitigate artifacts from speckle-induced ambiguity.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides robust all-weather imaging capabilities; however, translating SAR observations into photo-realistic optical images remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem. Current approaches are often hindered by the inherent speckle noise and geometric distortions of SAR data, which frequently result in semantic misinterpretation, ambiguous texture synthesis, and structural hallucinations. To address these limitations, a novel SAR-to-Optical (S2O) translation framework is proposed, integrating three core technical contributions: (i) Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment, which establishes an Optical-Aware SAR Encoder by distilling robust semantic priors from an Optical Teacher into a SAR Student (ii) Semantically-Grounded Generative Guidance, realized by a Semantically-Grounded ControlNet that integrates class-aware text prompts for global context with hierarchical visual prompts for local spatial guidance; and (iii) an Uncertainty-Aware Objective, which explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty to dynamically modulate the reconstruction focus, effectively mitigating artifacts caused by speckle-induced ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### [203] [PRISM: Color-Stratified Point Cloud Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06839)
*Hansol Lim,Minhyeok Im,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a color-guided stratified sampling method for RGB-LiDAR point clouds that allocates sampling density proportional to chromatic diversity rather than spatial uniformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unique scene features often exhibit chromatic diversity while repetitive features are homogeneous in color. Conventional downsampling methods enforce spatial uniformity but ignore photometric content, potentially losing important visual information.

Method: Treats RGB color space as stratification domain with maximum capacity k per color bin. Allocates sampling density proportional to chromatic diversity, preserving texture-rich regions with high color variation while reducing homogeneous surfaces.

Result: Produces sparser point clouds that retain essential features for 3D reconstruction tasks by shifting sampling focus from spatial coverage to visual complexity.

Conclusion: PRISM offers a novel approach to point cloud downsampling that better preserves visually important features by leveraging color information, addressing limitations of conventional spatial-only sampling methods.

Abstract: We present PRISM, a novel color-guided stratified sampling method for RGB-LiDAR point clouds. Our approach is motivated by the observation that unique scene features often exhibit chromatic diversity while repetitive, redundant features are homogeneous in color. Conventional downsampling methods (Random Sampling, Voxel Grid, Normal Space Sampling) enforce spatial uniformity while ignoring this photometric content. In contrast, PRISM allocates sampling density proportional to chormatic diversity. By treating RGB color space as the stratification domain and imposing a maximum capacity k per color bin, the method preserves texture-rich regions with high color variation while substantially reducing visually homogeneous surfaces. This shifts the sampling space from spatial coverage to visual complexity to produce sparser point clouds that retain essential features for 3D reconstruction tasks.

*Junyan Lin,Junlong Tong,Hao Wu,Jialiang Zhang,Jinming Liu,Xin Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parallel streaming framework for MLLMs that enables simultaneous perception and generation by relaxing positional continuity constraints, achieving 2x acceleration for real-time video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited to offline inference or sequential streaming, which creates latency issues for real-time video understanding due to the global positional continuity constraint that tightly couples perception and generation.

Method: Proposes three designs to relax positional continuity: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated, enabling parallel perception and generation by decoupling input processing from output generation.

Result: Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency, with up to 2x acceleration under balanced workloads.

Conclusion: The framework enables speak-while-watching real-time systems by addressing the fundamental bottleneck of positional continuity in MLLMs, establishing a principled pathway for real-time video understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance across many tasks, yet most systems remain limited to offline inference, requiring complete inputs before generating outputs. Recent streaming methods reduce latency by interleaving perception and generation, but still enforce a sequential perception-generation cycle, limiting real-time interaction. In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency. We further show that the proposed framework yields up to 2x acceleration under balanced perception-generation workloads, establishing a principled pathway toward speak-while-watching real-time systems. We make all our code publicly available: https://github.com/EIT-NLP/Speak-While-Watching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with visual grounding in clinical narratives due to scarcity of high-quality clinical referring-localization pairs, limiting their ability to anchor medical language to verifiable visual evidence.

Method: Automated pipeline that transforms segmentation resources into medical referring grounding data using expert masks as spatial anchors, extracts shape/spatial cues, guides VLMs to synthesize natural clinical queries, and implements multi-stage verification with formatting checks, geometry/medical-prior rules, and visual judging.

Result: Created MedGround-35K dataset; VLMs trained with it show improved referring grounding performance, better multi-object semantic disambiguation, and strong generalization to unseen grounding settings.

Conclusion: MedGround provides a scalable, data-driven approach to anchor medical language to visual evidence, addressing the visual grounding limitation in clinical VLMs through automated high-quality dataset generation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can generate convincing clinical narratives, yet frequently struggle to visually ground their statements. We posit this limitation arises from the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale clinical referring-localization pairs. To address this, we introduce MedGround, an automated pipeline that transforms segmentation resources into high-quality medical referring grounding data. Leveraging expert masks as spatial anchors, MedGround precisely derives localization targets, extracts shape and spatial cues, and guides VLMs to synthesize natural, clinically grounded queries that reflect morphology and location. To ensure data rigor, a multi-stage verification system integrates strict formatting checks, geometry- and medical-prior rules, and image-based visual judging to filter out ambiguous or visually unsupported samples. Finally, we present MedGround-35K, a novel multimodal medical dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLMs trained with MedGround-35K consistently achieve improved referring grounding performance, enhance multi-object semantic disambiguation, and exhibit strong generalization to unseen grounding settings. This work highlights MedGround as a scalable, data-driven approach to anchor medical language to verifiable visual evidence. Dataset and code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

TL;DR: MV-3DRES enables 3D referring expression segmentation directly from sparse multi-view images, overcoming limitations of traditional two-stage pipelines through an end-to-end framework with novel optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agents like robots and mobile phones operate with sparse RGB views and latency constraints, but existing 3DRES methods require dense point clouds. Traditional two-stage pipelines (reconstruct then segment) produce low-quality geometry, coarse target regions, and slow inference.

Method: Propose MVGGT (Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer), an end-to-end framework with dual-branch design integrating language into sparse-view geometric reasoning. Introduce PVSO (Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization) to solve Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD) problem from sparse 3D supervision.

Result: MVGGT establishes first strong baseline for MV-3DRES, achieving high accuracy and fast inference while outperforming existing alternatives. Built MVRefer benchmark for standardized evaluation.

Conclusion: The work enables efficient 3D referring expression segmentation directly from sparse multi-view images, addressing real-world constraints through novel architecture and optimization techniques, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Most existing 3D referring expression segmentation (3DRES) methods rely on dense, high-quality point clouds, while real-world agents such as robots and mobile phones operate with only a few sparse RGB views and strict latency constraints. We introduce Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES), where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. We propose the Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT), an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning through a dual-branch design. Training in this setting exposes a critical optimization barrier, termed Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD), where sparse 3D signals lead to weak supervision. To resolve this, we introduce Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization (PVSO), which provides stronger and more balanced gradients across views, enabling stable and efficient learning. To support consistent evaluation, we build MVRefer, a benchmark that defines standardized settings and metrics for MV-3DRES. Experiments show that MVGGT establishes the first strong baseline and achieves both high accuracy and fast inference, outperforming existing alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation models trained on source domain data often fail on target domains due to domain shift in medical imaging. Manual labeling for each new domain is expensive and time-consuming, creating need for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Method: Proposes SAM-RefiSeR framework combining Segment Anything Model (SAM) with refinement and selection mechanisms. Uses SAM's zero-shot capabilities to generate pseudo-labels on target domain, then refines and selects high-quality pseudo-labels for iterative model adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on brain tumor segmentation across multiple domain shifts, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods while reducing dependency on target domain annotations.

Conclusion: SAM-RefiSeR provides effective unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation, leveraging foundation models' generalization capabilities to bridge domain gaps without manual labeling.

TL;DR: MixRI is a lightweight network for CAD-based novel object pose estimation in RGB images that works without finetuning, using fewer reference images and smaller network size while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CAD-based novel object pose estimation require many reference images and large network parameters, which increases memory requirements and inference time, making them less suitable for real-world applications.

Method: MixRI uses direct point matching based on multi-view information between query and reference images with a lightweight network. It employs a reference image fusion strategy to significantly reduce the number of reference images needed, decreasing processing time and memory requirements.

Result: Experiments on seven core datasets in the BOP challenge show that MixRI achieves comparable results to methods requiring more reference images and larger network parameters, while being more efficient.

Conclusion: MixRI provides an efficient solution for real-world CAD-based novel object pose estimation with reduced memory requirements and faster inference time, making it practical for deployment without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We present MixRI, a lightweight network that solves the CAD-based novel object pose estimation problem in RGB images. It can be instantly applied to a novel object at test time without finetuning. We design our network to meet the demands of real-world applications, emphasizing reduced memory requirements and fast inference time. Unlike existing works that utilize many reference images and have large network parameters, we directly match points based on the multi-view information between the query and reference images with a lightweight network. Thanks to our reference image fusion strategy, we significantly decrease the number of reference images, thus decreasing the time needed to process these images and the memory required to store them. Furthermore, with our lightweight network, our method requires less inference time. Though with fewer reference images, experiments on seven core datasets in the BOP challenge show that our method achieves comparable results with other methods that require more reference images and larger network parameters.

*Nimrod Shabtay,Itamar Zimerman,Eli Schwartz,Raja Giryes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIMP replaces CLIP's Vision Transformers with Mamba-based architecture for both vision and text encoders, improving efficiency, handling variable resolutions naturally, and achieving better performance on cross-modal retrieval and out-of-distribution robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's Vision Transformers have limitations: attention mechanism is susceptible to spurious correlations, scales quadratically with resolution, requires positional encoding interpolation for variable resolutions, and has fixed context limitations in text encoding.

Method: Develop CLIMP - a fully Mamba-based contrastive vision-language model that replaces both vision and text encoders with Mamba architecture. Uses VMamba for visual encoding to capture spatial inductive biases, and autoregressive Mamba for text encoding.

Result: CLIMP surpasses OpenAI's CLIP-ViT-B by 7.5% on ImageNet-O, achieves up to 6.6% higher retrieval accuracy at 16x training resolution while using 5x less memory and 1.8x fewer FLOPs, and enables dense captioning retrieval.

Conclusion: Mamba exhibits advantageous properties for vision-language learning, making it a compelling alternative to Transformer-based CLIP, with better efficiency, natural handling of variable resolutions, and improved robustness.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) relies on Vision Transformers whose attention mechanism is susceptible to spurious correlations, and scales quadratically with resolution. To address these limitations, We present CLIMP, the first fully Mamba-based contrastive vision-language model that replaces both the vision and text encoders with Mamba. The new architecture encodes sequential structure in both vision and language, with VMamba capturing visual spatial inductive biases, reducing reliance on spurious correlations and producing an embedding space favorable for cross-modal retrieval and out-of-distribution robustness-surpassing OpenAI's CLIP-ViT-B by 7.5% on ImageNet-O. CLIMP naturally supports variable input resolutions without positional encoding interpolation or specialized training, achieving up to 6.6% higher retrieval accuracy at 16x training resolution while using 5x less memory and 1.8x fewer FLOPs. The autoregressive text encoder further overcomes CLIP's fixed context limitation, enabling dense captioning retrieval. Our findings suggest that Mamba exhibits advantageous properties for vision-language learning, making it a compelling alternative to Transformer-based CLIP.

### [210] [UDPNet: Unleashing Depth-based Priors for Robust Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06909)
*Zengyuan Zuo,Junjun Jiang,Gang Wu,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UDPNet is a depth-aware image dehazing framework that leverages pretrained depth estimation models to boost existing dehazing methods through depth-guided attention and fusion modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing dehazing methods focus only on RGB features and neglect the correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even methods that jointly optimize depth estimation and dehazing suffer from inadequate utilization of accurate depth information.

Method: UDPNet uses depth priors from DepthAnything V2 pretrained model. It features two main components: Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) for adaptive feature modulation via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) for hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features using dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets: 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on SOTS, 1.19 dB on Haze4K, and 1.79 dB PSNR on NHR dataset. The depth priors enable dynamic adaptation to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps.

Conclusion: UDPNet establishes a new benchmark for depth-aware dehazing across various scenarios by effectively integrating depth priors from large-scale pretrained models into existing dehazing architectures.

Abstract: Image dehazing has witnessed significant advancements with the development of deep learning models. However, a few methods predominantly focus on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two typical components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness of depth priors empowers the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, such as 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on the SOTS dataset, 1.19 dB on the Haze4K dataset and 1.79 dB PSNR on the NHR dataset. Our proposed solution establishes a new benchmark for depth-aware dehazing across various scenarios. Pretrained models and codes will be released at our project https://github.com/Harbinzzy/UDPNet.

*Shenghao Zhang,Runtao Liu,Christopher Schroers,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RenderFlow: A deterministic single-step neural rendering framework using flow matching that achieves near real-time photorealistic rendering without the latency and stochasticity of diffusion models, with optional sparse keyframe guidance for enhanced quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning rendering approaches using diffusion models have two major limitations: 1) substantial latency from iterative diffusion processes, and 2) compromised physical accuracy and temporal consistency due to inherent stochasticity. There's a need to bridge the gap between generative model efficiency and traditional physically based rendering precision.

Method: Proposes RenderFlow, an end-to-end deterministic single-step neural rendering framework built on flow matching paradigm. Includes an efficient module for sparse keyframe guidance to enhance rendering quality and generalization. Also introduces a lightweight adapter-based module that repurposes the pretrained forward model for inverse rendering tasks like intrinsic decomposition.

Result: The method significantly accelerates rendering process, achieves near real-time performance with photorealistic quality, enhances physical plausibility and visual quality through sparse keyframe guidance, and demonstrates versatility by efficiently adapting to inverse rendering tasks.

Conclusion: RenderFlow effectively bridges the gap between generative model efficiency and traditional physically based rendering precision, offering a deterministic, fast alternative to stochastic diffusion-based approaches while maintaining high visual quality and enabling versatile applications including inverse rendering.

Abstract: Conventional physically based rendering (PBR) pipelines generate photorealistic images through computationally intensive light transport simulations. Although recent deep learning approaches leverage diffusion model priors with geometry buffers (G-buffers) to produce visually compelling results without explicit scene geometry or light simulation, they remain constrained by two major limitations. First, the iterative nature of the diffusion process introduces substantial latency. Second, the inherent stochasticity of these generative models compromises physical accuracy and temporal consistency. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel, end-to-end, deterministic, single-step neural rendering framework, RenderFlow, built upon a flow matching paradigm. To further strengthen both rendering quality and generalization, we propose an efficient and effective module for sparse keyframe guidance. Our method significantly accelerates the rendering process and, by optionally incorporating sparsely rendered keyframes as guidance, enhances both the physical plausibility and overall visual quality of the output. The resulting pipeline achieves near real-time performance with photorealistic rendering quality, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of modern generative models and the precision of traditional physically based rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework by introducing a lightweight, adapter-based module that efficiently repurposes the pretrained forward model for the inverse rendering task of intrinsic decomposition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm (FOCUS dataset) isolates demographic effects in VLMs by editing only facial attributes while keeping other visual factors fixed, revealing persistent social biases across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are deployed in socially consequential settings, raising concerns about social bias driven by demographic cues. Current evaluations are confounded by real-world images where race/gender are entangled with correlated factors like background and clothing, obscuring attribution.

Method: Propose a face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm: starting from real photographs, generate counterfactual variants by editing only facial attributes related to race and gender while keeping all other visual factors fixed. Construct FOCUS dataset (480 scene-matched counterfactual images across 6 occupations and 10 demographic groups) and REFLECT benchmark with three decision-oriented tasks.

Result: Experiments on five state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that demographic disparities persist under strict visual control and vary substantially across different task formulations.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the necessity of controlled, counterfactual audits for measuring social bias in VLMs and highlight task design as a critical factor in evaluating social bias in multimodal models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in socially consequential settings, raising concerns about social bias driven by demographic cues. A central challenge in measuring such social bias is attribution under visual confounding: real-world images entangle race and gender with correlated factors such as background and clothing, obscuring attribution. We propose a \textbf{face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm} that isolates demographic effects while preserving real-image realism. Starting from real photographs, we generate counterfactual variants by editing only facial attributes related to race and gender, keeping all other visual factors fixed. Based on this paradigm, we construct \textbf{FOCUS}, a dataset of 480 scene-matched counterfactual images across six occupations and ten demographic groups, and propose \textbf{REFLECT}, a benchmark comprising three decision-oriented tasks: two-alternative forced choice, multiple-choice socioeconomic inference, and numeric salary recommendation. Experiments on five state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that demographic disparities persist under strict visual control and vary substantially across task formulations. These findings underscore the necessity of controlled, counterfactual audits and highlight task design as a critical factor in evaluating social bias in multimodal models.

TL;DR: VideoDR is the first benchmark for video deep research requiring cross-frame visual clue extraction, iterative web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over video-web evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world video QA often provides only localized visual cues while answers are distributed across the open web, requiring models to perform cross-frame clue extraction, iterative retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning-based verification.

Method: Constructed VideoDR benchmark with human-annotated high-quality samples spanning six semantic domains, evaluating multimodal LLMs under Workflow and Agentic paradigms.

Result: Agentic approach is not consistently superior to Workflow - gains depend on model's ability to maintain initial video anchors over long retrieval chains. Goal drift and long-horizon consistency are core bottlenecks.

Conclusion: VideoDR provides systematic benchmark for studying video agents in open-web settings and reveals key challenges for next-generation video deep research agents.

Abstract: In real-world video question answering scenarios, videos often provide only localized visual cues, while verifiable answers are distributed across the open web; models therefore need to jointly perform cross-frame clue extraction, iterative retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning-based verification. To bridge this gap, we construct the first video deep research benchmark, VideoDR. VideoDR centers on video-conditioned open-domain video question answering, requiring cross-frame visual anchor extraction, interactive web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over joint video-web evidence; through rigorous human annotation and quality control, we obtain high-quality video deep research samples spanning six semantic domains. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains. Further analysis indicates that goal drift and long-horizon consistency are the core bottlenecks. In sum, VideoDR provides a systematic benchmark for studying video agents in open-web settings and reveals the key challenges for next-generation video deep research agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchJudge is a new benchmark for evaluating MLLMs as graders of hand-drawn STEM diagrams, revealing that current models significantly underperform humans in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with unstructured and ambiguous human sketches, particularly in visual grading tasks that require diagnosing errors in hand-drawn diagrams. Current models lack the complex structural, semantic, and metacognitive reasoning needed for this underexplored task.

Method: Created SketchJudge benchmark with 1,015 hand-drawn student responses across four STEM domains (geometry, physics, charts, flowcharts) featuring diverse stylistic variations and distinct error types. Evaluated advanced MLLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Even advanced MLLMs lag significantly behind humans in grading hand-drawn STEM diagrams, validating the benchmark's effectiveness in exposing fragility of current vision-language alignment in symbolic and noisy contexts.

Conclusion: SketchJudge successfully exposes limitations of current MLLMs in visual grading of hand-drawn diagrams, highlighting the need for improved vision-language alignment for symbolic and noisy visual inputs. The benchmark is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual understanding, they often struggle when faced with the unstructured and ambiguous nature of human-generated sketches. This limitation is particularly pronounced in the underexplored task of visual grading, where models should not only solve a problem but also diagnose errors in hand-drawn diagrams. Such diagnostic capabilities depend on complex structural, semantic, and metacognitive reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SketchJudge, a novel benchmark tailored for evaluating MLLMs as graders of hand-drawn STEM diagrams. SketchJudge encompasses 1,015 hand-drawn student responses across four domains: geometry, physics, charts, and flowcharts, featuring diverse stylistic variations and distinct error types. Evaluations on SketchJudge demonstrate that even advanced MLLMs lag significantly behind humans, validating the benchmark's effectiveness in exposing the fragility of current vision-language alignment in symbolic and noisy contexts.

TL;DR: OmniPersona is an end-to-end personalization framework for unified large multimodal models that integrates personalized understanding, generation, and image editing in a single architecture, addressing cross-task interference through decoupled concept tokens and knowledge replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models struggle with user-specific concept modeling in a consistent and controllable manner. Existing personalization methods are inefficient (relying on external retrieval) or cause cross-task interference through coupled understanding/generation or complex multi-stage training.

Method: Introduces structurally decoupled concept tokens that allocate dedicated subspaces for different tasks to minimize interference, and incorporates an explicit knowledge replay mechanism that propagates personalized attribute knowledge across tasks for consistent personalized behavior.

Result: OmniPersona delivers competitive and robust performance across diverse personalization tasks. The authors also propose OmniPBench, an extended benchmark with personalized editing tasks and cross-task evaluation protocols integrating understanding, generation, and editing.

Conclusion: OmniPersona represents the first end-to-end personalization framework for unified LMMs that integrates personalized understanding, generation, and image editing within a single architecture, serving as a strong baseline for future research on controllable, unified personalization.

Abstract: Unified large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in general-purpose multimodal understanding and generation. However, they still operate under a ``one-size-fits-all'' paradigm and struggle to model user-specific concepts (e.g., generate a photo of \texttt{<maeve>}) in a consistent and controllable manner. Existing personalization methods typically rely on external retrieval, which is inefficient and poorly integrated into unified multimodal pipelines. Recent personalized unified models introduce learnable soft prompts to encode concept information, yet they either couple understanding and generation or depend on complex multi-stage training, leading to cross-task interference and ultimately to fuzzy or misaligned personalized knowledge. We present \textbf{OmniPersona}, an end-to-end personalization framework for unified LMMs that, for the first time, integrates personalized understanding, generation, and image editing within a single architecture. OmniPersona introduces structurally decoupled concept tokens, allocating dedicated subspaces for different tasks to minimize interference, and incorporates an explicit knowledge replay mechanism that propagates personalized attribute knowledge across tasks, enabling consistent personalized behavior. To systematically evaluate unified personalization, we propose \textbf{\texttt{OmniPBench}}, extending the public UnifyBench concept set with personalized editing tasks and cross-task evaluation protocols integrating understanding, generation, and editing. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPersona delivers competitive and robust performance across diverse personalization tasks. We hope OmniPersona will serve as a strong baseline and spur further research on controllable, unified personalization.

*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT reasoning hurts FGVC performance due to "Cost of Thinking" - longer reasoning reduces accuracy. Proposed ReFine-RFT framework with normalization method balances rewards to constrain reasoning length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) despite strong general capabilities. While CoT helps with math/coding tasks, it degrades visual perception performance, but the reasons remain unclear.

Method: Systematically examine CoT in FGVC through zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Identify reasoning length as the key degradation factor. Propose: 1) normalization method for multi-reward optimization, 2) ReFine-RFT framework combining ensemble rewards with normalization to constrain reasoning length while providing accuracy feedback.

Result: Uncovered "Cost of Thinking" phenomenon: longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. ReFine-RFT achieves state-of-the-art performance across FGVC benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoT's degradation in FGVC is driven by reasoning length. The proposed ReFine-RFT framework effectively addresses this issue by balancing rewards and constraining reasoning, enabling better FGVC performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose capabilities, yet still struggle on Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC), a core perception task that requires subtle visual discrimination and is crucial for many real-world applications. A widely adopted strategy for boosting performance on challenging tasks such as math and coding is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our findings and the proposed ReFine-RFT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across FGVC benchmarks. Code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/jiezhu23/ReFine-RFT}{Project Link}.

*Sen Zeng,Hong Zhou,Zheng Zhu,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatial multi-task learning framework predicts breast cancer molecular subtypes from single-phase DCE-MRI, achieving high accuracy for ER, PR, HER2 classification and Ki-67 regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional immunohistochemical analysis for breast cancer molecular subtyping is invasive and prone to sampling bias. Clinical DCE-MRI workflows typically use only single-phase post-contrast images to reduce scan time and contrast dose, creating a need for non-invasive prediction methods using standard imaging protocols.

Method: A spatial multi-task learning framework that simultaneously predicts ER, PR, HER2 status, and Ki-67 proliferation index from single-phase DCE-MRI. The architecture integrates deep feature extraction with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, plus a region-of-interest weighting module emphasizing tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches.

Result: The method achieved AUCs of 0.893, 0.824, and 0.857 for ER, PR, and HER2 classification respectively, and a mean absolute error of 8.2% for Ki-67 regression. It significantly outperformed radiomics and single-task deep learning baselines on a dataset of 960 cases (886 internal with 7:1:2 split, 74 external with five-fold cross-validation).

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of accurate, non-invasive molecular subtype prediction using standard single-phase DCE-MRI protocols, potentially enabling personalized breast cancer treatment without invasive biopsies.

Abstract: Accurate molecular subtype classification is essential for personalized breast cancer treatment, yet conventional immunohistochemical analysis relies on invasive biopsies and is prone to sampling bias. Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enables non-invasive tumor characterization, clinical workflows typically acquire only single-phase post-contrast images to reduce scan time and contrast agent dose. In this study, we propose a spatial multi-task learning framework for breast cancer molecular subtype prediction from clinically practical single-phase DCE-MRI. The framework simultaneously predicts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index -- biomarkers that collectively define molecular subtypes. The architecture integrates a deep feature extraction network with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, together with a region-of-interest weighting module that emphasizes the tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches. Experiments on a dataset of 960 cases (886 internal cases split 7:1:2 for training/validation/testing, and 74 external cases evaluated via five-fold cross-validation) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an AUC of 0.893, 0.824, and 0.857 for ER, PR, and HER2 classification, respectively, and a mean absolute error of 8.2\% for Ki-67 regression, significantly outperforming radiomics and single-task deep learning baselines. These results indicate the feasibility of accurate, non-invasive molecular subtype prediction using standard imaging protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA models for autonomous driving prioritize performance over efficiency, using dense patch tokens for every frame leading to high computational costs and latency. This limits real-time deployment in safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios where fast processing is essential.

Method: Proposes SRC-Pipeline framework that learns to compress early frame tokens into a small number of high-level tokens while retaining full patch tokens for recent frames, reducing computational overhead.

Result: Achieves 66% FLOPs reduction while maintaining comparable performance on autonomous driving video question answering tasks, enabling more effective real-time operation.

Conclusion: SRC-Pipeline addresses the efficiency bottleneck of current VLMs for autonomous driving VQA, making them more practical for real-time, safety-critical applications by significantly reducing computational costs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving increasingly relies on Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable vehicles to understand complex surroundings by analyzing visual inputs and textual queries. Currently, a paramount concern for VQA in this domain is the stringent requirement for fast latency and real-time processing, as delays directly impact real-world safety in this safety-critical application. However, current state-of-the-art VQA models, particularly large vision-language models (VLMs), often prioritize performance over computational efficiency. These models typically process dense patch tokens for every frame, leading to prohibitive computational costs (FLOPs) and significant inference latency, especially with long video sequences. This focus limits their practical deployment in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient VLM framework for autonomous driving VQA tasks, SRC-Pipeline. It learns to compress early frame tokens into a small number of high-level tokens while retaining full patch tokens for recent frames. Experiments on autonomous driving video question answering tasks show that our approach achieves 66% FLOPs reduction while maintaining comparable performance, enabling VLMs to operate more effectively in real-time, safety-critical autonomous driving settings.

TL;DR: WCC-Net is a 3D diffusion-based framework that uses wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising, improving image quality while maintaining anatomical consistency in low-dose scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose PET imaging reduces radiation exposure but suffers from increased noise that degrades image quality and diagnostic reliability. Existing diffusion models have strong denoising capability but their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, especially in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging.

Method: Proposes Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. The method injects wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, decoupling anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity.

Result: WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines. On the internal 1/20-dose test set, it improves PSNR by +1.21 dB and SSIM by +0.008 over a strong diffusion baseline, while reducing structural distortion (GMSD) and intensity error (NMAE). The method generalizes robustly to unseen dose levels (1/50 and 1/4), achieving superior quantitative performance and improved volumetric anatomical consistency.

Conclusion: WCC-Net effectively addresses the limitations of stochastic diffusion models in low-dose PET imaging by incorporating wavelet-based structural guidance, resulting in improved denoising performance while maintaining anatomical consistency across different dose levels.

Abstract: Low-dose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging reduces patient radiation exposure but suffers from increased noise that degrades image quality and diagnostic reliability. Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines. On the internal 1/20-dose test set, WCC-Net improves PSNR by +1.21 dB and SSIM by +0.008 over a strong diffusion baseline, while reducing structural distortion (GMSD) and intensity error (NMAE). Moreover, WCC-Net generalizes robustly to unseen dose levels (1/50 and 1/4), achieving superior quantitative performance and improved volumetric anatomical consistency.

TL;DR: MedVistaGym: A training environment that teaches VLMs to use tools for medical image reasoning through agentic training, achieving significant performance gains over tool-augmented baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning and iterative visual interaction. They rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, lacking ability to re-examine, verify, or refine visual evidence. Tool-integrated reasoning shows promise but open-source VLMs lack training infrastructure for effective tool selection and coordination.

Method: Introduces MedVistaGym, a scalable interactive training environment that incentivizes tool-integrated visual reasoning. It trains VLMs to determine when/which tools to invoke, localize relevant image regions, and integrate evidence into multimodal reasoning. Uses trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning to train MedVistaGym-R1.

Result: MedVistaGym-R1-8B exceeds comparably sized tool-augmented baselines by 19.10% to 24.21% across six medical VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured agentic training—not just tool access—unlocks effective tool-integrated reasoning for medical image analysis, demonstrating the importance of training infrastructure for medical VLMs.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on general image understanding but struggle to think with medical images, especially when performing multi-step reasoning through iterative visual interaction. Medical VLMs often rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, preventing models from re-examining, verifying, or refining visual evidence during reasoning. While tool-integrated reasoning offers a promising path forward, open-source VLMs lack the training infrastructure to learn effective tool selection, invocation, and coordination in multi-modal medical reasoning. We introduce MedVistaGym, a scalable and interactive training environment that incentivizes tool-integrated visual reasoning for medical image analysis. MedVistaGym equips VLMs to determine when and which tools to invoke, localize task-relevant image regions, and integrate single or multiple sub-image evidence into interleaved multimodal reasoning within a unified, executable interface for agentic training. Using MedVistaGym, we train MedVistaGym-R1 to interleave tool use with agentic reasoning through trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Across six medical VQA benchmarks, MedVistaGym-R1-8B exceeds comparably sized tool-augmented baselines by 19.10% to 24.21%, demonstrating that structured agentic training--not tool access alone--unlocks effective tool-integrated reasoning for medical image analysis.

*Kexin Bao,Yong Li,Dan Zeng,Shiming Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative co-memory regularization approach for few-shot class-incremental learning that uses generative domain adaptation finetuning and two class-wise memories to improve recognition while mitigating catastrophic forgetting and overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSCIL requires models to have strong representation and adaptation abilities to avoid catastrophic forgetting on old classes and overfitting to novel classes when learning from few examples. Existing methods need improvement in handling these challenges effectively.

Method: 1) Base learning with generative domain adaptation finetuning using MAE decoder for feature reconstruction and classifier for feature classification. 2) Construction of two class-wise memories: representation memory (mean features) and weight memory (classifier weights). 3) Memory-regularized incremental learning with co-memory regularization that updates memories incrementally and collaboratively regularizes learning.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks, improving recognition accuracy while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to novel classes.

Conclusion: The proposed generative co-memory regularization approach successfully addresses FSCIL challenges by leveraging generative domain adaptation and collaborative memory regularization, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally learn models from a small amount of novel data, which requires strong representation and adaptation ability of models learned under few-example supervision to avoid catastrophic forgetting on old classes and overfitting to novel classes. This work proposes a generative co-memory regularization approach to facilitate FSCIL. In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing egocentric datasets focus on action recognition but overlook motion analysis in sports and fast-movement scenarios. There's a gap in understanding locomotion intention from egocentric video.

Method: Leverages foundation model for camera pose estimation with system-level optimizations. Uses sliding batch inference strategy for efficient real-time processing with manageable memory consumption.

To bridge this gap, we propose a real-time motion focus recognition method that estimates the subject's locomotion intention from any egocentric video. Our approach leverages the foundation model for camera pose estimation and introduces system-level optimizations to enable efficient and scalable inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable learning on low-quality multimodal data is critical for safety-critical applications, but existing methods struggle with heterogeneous multimodal noise removal and lack adaptability to unseen noise patterns.

Method: TAHCD introduces Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment for reliable heterogeneous noise removal at global and instance levels. It also employs test-time cooperative enhancement that adaptively updates the model in a label-free manner based on input noise.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show TAHCD achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.

Conclusion: TAHCD effectively addresses multimodal noise challenges through hierarchical denoising and test-time adaptation, enabling reliable multimodal learning on low-quality data with improved robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Reliable learning on low-quality multimodal data is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications. However, multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain and leads existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to reliably remove heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces test-time cooperative enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, improving adaptability and generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIVER is a dynamic multimodal fake news detection framework that uses progressive evidence reasoning, starting with text analysis and only introducing visual tools when needed, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fake news detection methods suffer from computational redundancy and hallucination risks due to weak visual foundations and static fusion approaches, creating a need for more efficient and reliable detection frameworks.

Method: DIVER employs a progressive evidence-driven reasoning paradigm: 1) establishes text-based baseline using language analysis and intra-modal consistency filtering, 2) introduces visual information only when textual evidence is insufficient, 3) uses inter-modal alignment verification to determine need for deeper visual inspection, 4) selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (OCR, dense captioning) for cross-modal discrepancies, and 5) iteratively aggregates evidence via uncertainty-aware fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by average 2.72% on Weibo, Weibo21, and GossipCop datasets while reducing inference latency by 4.12 seconds, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: DIVER provides an effective solution for multimodal fake news detection by dynamically integrating textual and visual evidence through progressive reasoning, addressing computational redundancy and hallucination issues while maintaining high detection performance.

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection is crucial for mitigating adversarial misinformation. Existing methods, relying on static fusion or LLMs, face computational redundancy and hallucination risks due to weak visual foundations. To address this, we propose DIVER (Dynamic Iterative Visual Evidence Reasoning), a framework grounded in a progressive, evidence-driven reasoning paradigm. DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning. Experiments on Weibo, Weibo21, and GossipCop demonstrate that DIVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 2.72\%, while optimizing inference efficiency with a reduced latency of 4.12 s.

TL;DR: ShowUI-Aloha is a pipeline that converts unstructured human screen recordings into structured, actionable tasks for training GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating complex GUI tasks is challenging due to lack of scalable, high-quality training data. Human demonstrations are rich but unstructured and lack annotations, making them difficult for agents to learn from.

Method: Four-component pipeline: 1) Recorder captures screen video with precise user interactions, 2) Learner semantically interprets raw interactions into natural language captions, 3) Planner reads demonstrations, maintains task states, and formulates next action plans, 4) Executor carries out action plans at OS level with safety checks.

Result: The framework provides a scalable solution for collecting and parsing real-world human data, demonstrating a viable path toward building general-purpose GUI agents.

Conclusion: ShowUI-Aloha enables GUI agents to learn effectively from simply observing humans by transforming unstructured screen recordings into structured, actionable tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are central to human-computer interaction, yet automating complex GUI tasks remains a major challenge for autonomous agents, largely due to a lack of scalable, high-quality training data. While recordings of human demonstrations offer a rich data source, they are typically long, unstructured, and lack annotations, making them difficult for agents to learn from.To address this, we introduce ShowUI-Aloha, a comprehensive pipeline that transforms unstructured, in-the-wild human screen recordings from desktop environments into structured, actionable tasks. Our framework includes four key components: A recorder that captures screen video along with precise user interactions like mouse clicks, keystrokes, and scrolls. A learner that semantically interprets these raw interactions and the surrounding visual context, translating them into descriptive natural language captions. A planner that reads the parsed demonstrations, maintains task states, and dynamically formulates the next high-level action plan based on contextual reasoning. An executor that faithfully carries out these action plans at the OS level, performing precise clicks, drags, text inputs, and window operations with safety checks and real-time feedback. Together, these components provide a scalable solution for collecting and parsing real-world human data, demonstrating a viable path toward building general-purpose GUI agents that can learn effectively from simply observing humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SIRR datasets lack either physical realism (synthetic) or sufficient scale (real captures), limiting reflection removal performance.

Method: 1) Path-trace 3D glass models over real backgrounds for physically accurate synthetic data; 2) Concatenate image layers into composite input; 3) Apply joint captioning and fine-tune LMM using task-specific LoRA instead of full-parameter training.

Result: Achieves improved reflection removal and separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Combining physically-accurate synthetic data generation with efficient LMM fine-tuning enables better reflection removal than existing approaches.

Abstract: Glass surfaces create complex interactions of reflected and transmitted light, making single-image reflection removal (SIRR) challenging. Existing datasets suffer from limited physical realism in synthetic data or insufficient scale in real captures. We introduce a synthetic dataset generation framework that path-traces 3D glass models over real background imagery to create physically accurate reflection scenarios with varied glass properties, camera settings, and post-processing effects. To leverage the capabilities of Large Multimodal Model (LMM), we concatenate the image layers into a single composite input, apply joint captioning, and fine-tune the model using task-specific LoRA rather than full-parameter training. This enables our approach to achieve improved reflection removal and separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneNAT is a single-stage masked non-autoregressive Transformer that generates 3D indoor scenes from text instructions in few parallel decoding passes, outperforming autoregressive and diffusion models with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D scene generation from text are either autoregressive (slow) or diffusion-based (computationally expensive). There's a need for efficient single-stage generation that captures both semantic and spatial relationships while maintaining high quality.

Method: SceneNAT uses masked non-autoregressive Transformer with dual-level masking (attribute and instance) on discretized semantic/spatial representations. It includes a triplet predictor for relational reasoning that maps learnable relation queries to symbolic triplets (subject, predicate, object) to model scene layout and object relationships.

Result: On 3D-FRONT dataset, SceneNAT achieves superior performance in semantic compliance and spatial arrangement accuracy compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines, while operating with substantially lower computational cost.

Conclusion: SceneNAT demonstrates that masked non-autoregressive modeling with relational reasoning can efficiently generate high-quality 3D scenes from text, offering a promising direction for scalable scene synthesis.

Abstract: We present SceneNAT, a single-stage masked non-autoregressive Transformer that synthesizes complete 3D indoor scenes from natural language instructions through only a few parallel decoding passes, offering improved performance and efficiency compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches. SceneNAT is trained via masked modeling over fully discretized representations of both semantic and spatial attributes. By applying a masking strategy at both the attribute level and the instance level, the model can better capture intra-object and inter-object structure. To boost relational reasoning, SceneNAT employs a dedicated triplet predictor for modeling the scene's layout and object relationships by mapping a set of learnable relation queries to a sparse set of symbolic triplets (subject, predicate, object). Extensive experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset demonstrate that SceneNAT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in both semantic compliance and spatial arrangement accuracy, while operating with substantially lower computational cost.

*Thanh-Nhan Vo,Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VENUS is a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing that uses noise inversion and split prompt conditioning to improve background preservation and semantic consistency without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based image editing models struggle with balancing background preservation and semantic consistency, while scene graph-based methods require computationally expensive fine-tuning, limiting scalability.

Method: VENUS uses a training-free approach with split prompt conditioning to disentangle target objects from background context, leverages noise inversion to preserve unedited regions, and integrates scene graphs from multimodal LLMs with diffusion backbones.

Result: Substantial improvements on PIE-Bench: PSNR increased from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, LPIPS reduced from 0.100 to 0.070. Enhanced semantic consistency (CLIP similarity 24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal: 0.87 DINO score and runtime reduced from 6-10 minutes to 20-30 seconds per image.

Conclusion: VENUS provides an efficient, training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing that significantly improves both background preservation and semantic alignment while dramatically reducing computational costs, outperforming both scene graph and text-based editing baselines.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-based image editing models often struggle to balance background preservation with semantic consistency, frequently resulting either in the synthesis of entirely new images or in outputs that fail to realize the intended edits. In contrast, scene graph-based image editing addresses this limitation by providing a structured representation of semantic entities and their relations, thereby offering improved controllability. However, existing scene graph editing methods typically depend on model fine-tuning, which incurs high computational cost and limits scalability. To this end, we introduce VENUS (Visual Editing with Noise inversion Using Scene graphs), a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing. Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms.

TL;DR: LACE is a language-grounded image translation framework that uses GLIP-Adapter for structural preservation and Multi-Domain Control Guidance for fine-grained attribute control based on semantic differences in text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-domain image-to-image translation methods struggle with maintaining structural integrity and providing fine-grained, attribute-specific control when handling multiple domains simultaneously.

Method: LACE combines two components: (1) GLIP-Adapter that fuses global semantics with local structural features to preserve consistency, and (2) Multi-Domain Control Guidance that grounds semantic differences between source/target prompts into per-attribute translation vectors.

Result: Experiments on CelebA(Dialog) and BDD100K show LACE achieves high visual fidelity, structural preservation, and interpretable domain-specific control, surpassing prior baselines.

Conclusion: LACE serves as a cross-modal content generation framework that effectively bridges language semantics with controllable visual translation for multi-domain image transformation.

Abstract: Multi-domain image-to-image translation re quires grounding semantic differences ex pressed in natural language prompts into corresponding visual transformations, while preserving unrelated structural and seman tic content. Existing methods struggle to maintain structural integrity and provide fine grained, attribute-specific control, especially when multiple domains are involved. We propose LACE (Language-grounded Attribute Controllable Translation), built on two compo nents: (1) a GLIP-Adapter that fuses global semantics with local structural features to pre serve consistency, and (2) a Multi-Domain Control Guidance mechanism that explicitly grounds the semantic delta between source and target prompts into per-attribute translation vec tors, aligning linguistic semantics with domain level visual changes. Together, these modules enable compositional multi-domain control with independent strength modulation for each attribute. Experiments on CelebA(Dialog) and BDD100K demonstrate that LACE achieves high visual fidelity, structural preservation, and interpretable domain-specific control, surpass ing prior baselines. This positions LACE as a cross-modal content generation framework bridging language semantics and controllable visual translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UDAP is a novel adversarial purification framework specifically designed for Stable Diffusion models that effectively removes adversarial noise by leveraging DDIM inversion reconstruction behaviors and dynamic epoch adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stable Diffusion models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks targeting various components (VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both), but existing purification methods are designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies.

Method: UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean vs. adversarial images during DDIM inversion to optimize purification. It minimizes DDIM metric loss to remove adversarial noise and uses a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors for improved efficiency.

Result: UDAP demonstrates robustness against diverse adversarial methods including PID, Anti-DreamBooth, MIST, Anti-DF, and MetaCloak. It generalizes well across SD versions and text prompts, showing practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: UDAP effectively addresses the gap in SD security by providing a specialized adversarial purification framework that protects Stable Diffusion models from various attack strategies while maintaining efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Stable Diffusion (SD) often produces degraded outputs when the training dataset contains adversarial noise. Adversarial purification offers a promising solution by removing adversarial noise from contaminated data. However, existing purification methods are primarily designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies, such as attacks targeting the VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both. To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak. UDAP also generalizes well across SD versions and text prompts, showcasing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AE embeddings outperform conventional landslide conditioning factors for susceptibility mapping across multiple regions using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional landslide conditioning factors have limitations in availability, heterogeneity, and preprocessing uncertainties. AE embeddings offer a unified representation of Earth surface conditions that could improve LSM reliability.

Method: Compared two AE representations (retained principal components and full 64-band embeddings) with conventional LCFs across three study areas using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, Vision Transformer). Evaluated with multiple metrics, ROC-AUC, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment.

Result: AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, with 4-15% F1-score improvements and 0.04-0.11 AUC increases. Full 64-band AE performed best. AE maps showed clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslides and better sensitivity to local conditions.

Conclusion: AE embeddings are a standardized, information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM, with performance improvements linked to temporal alignment between embeddings and landslide inventories.

Abstract: Data-driven landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) typically relies on landslide conditioning factors (LCFs), whose availability, heterogeneity, and preprocessing-related uncertainties can constrain mapping reliability. Recently, Google AlphaEarth (AE) embeddings, derived from multi-source geospatial observations, have emerged as a unified representation of Earth surface conditions. This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes. These findings highlight the strong potential of AE embeddings as a standardised and information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion retargeting between characters with different skeleton structures is challenging, especially when bone arrangements differ significantly, making it difficult to maintain motion semantics and quality.

Method: Partitions joints into semantic body parts, applies attention mechanisms to capture spatio-temporal relationships, learns common motion representations across diverse skeleton topologies, and uses cycle consistency for semantic coherence preservation.

Result: Superior performance in handling diverse skeletal structures while maintaining motion realism and semantic fidelity, even generalizing to unseen skeleton-motion combinations.

Conclusion: PALUM provides an effective solution for motion retargeting across different skeleton structures by learning skeleton-agnostic representations with semantic coherence preservation.

Abstract: Retargeting motion between characters with different skeleton structures is a fundamental challenge in computer animation. When source and target characters have vastly different bone arrangements, maintaining the original motion's semantics and quality becomes increasingly difficult. We present PALUM, a novel approach that learns common motion representations across diverse skeleton topologies by partitioning joints into semantic body parts and applying attention mechanisms to capture spatio-temporal relationships. Our method transfers motion to target skeletons by leveraging these skeleton-agnostic representations alongside target-specific structural information. To ensure robust learning and preserve motion fidelity, we introduce a cycle consistency mechanism that maintains semantic coherence throughout the retargeting process. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in handling diverse skeletal structures while maintaining motion realism and semantic fidelity, even when generalizing to previously unseen skeleton-motion combinations.

TL;DR: GenDet redefines object detection as an image generation task using generative modeling to directly generate bounding boxes with semantic annotations in image space, achieving competitive accuracy while maintaining generative flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between generative models and discriminative tasks, providing a fresh perspective for unified visual understanding systems by rethinking object detection through generative modeling rather than traditional discriminative approaches.

Method: GenDet uses a conditional generation architecture built on pre-trained Stable Diffusion, formulating detection as semantic constraints in latent space. It conditions on input images and directly generates bounding boxes with semantic annotations in original image space, enabling precise control over box positions and categories.

Result: Systematic experiments show GenDet achieves competitive accuracy compared to discriminative detectors while retaining the flexibility characteristic of generative methods.

Conclusion: GenDet successfully bridges generative models and discriminative tasks, offering a novel approach to object detection that combines competitive performance with generative flexibility for unified visual understanding systems.

Abstract: This paper presents GenDet, a novel framework that redefines object detection as an image generation task. In contrast to traditional approaches, GenDet adopts a pioneering approach by leveraging generative modeling: it conditions on the input image and directly generates bounding boxes with semantic annotations in the original image space. GenDet establishes a conditional generation architecture built upon the large-scale pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, formulating the detection task as semantic constraints within the latent space. It enables precise control over bounding box positions and category attributes, while preserving the flexibility of the generative model. This novel methodology effectively bridges the gap between generative models and discriminative tasks, providing a fresh perspective for constructing unified visual understanding systems. Systematic experiments demonstrate that GenDet achieves competitive accuracy compared to discriminative detectors, while retaining the flexibility characteristic of generative methods.

### [236] [Focal Guidance: Unlocking Controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers in Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07287)
*Yuanyang Yin,Yufan Deng,Shenghai Yuan,Kaipeng Zhang,Xiao Yang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Focal Guidance improves text adherence in Image-to-Video generation by addressing Semantic-Weak Layers in DiT models through fine-grained semantic guidance and attention cache mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency but struggle with effectively coupling visual constraints with textual guidance, leading to weak semantic responses in certain intermediate layers (Semantic-Weak Layers) due to Condition Isolation phenomenon.

Method: Proposes Focal Guidance (FG) with two mechanisms: 1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) uses CLIP to identify key regions in reference frames as anchors for Semantic-Weak Layers; 2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers to inject explicit semantic signals.

Result: FG improves instruction following in I2V models, raising total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97%) and boosting MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44%). The paper also introduces a benchmark for evaluating instruction following in I2V models.

Conclusion: Focal Guidance effectively addresses the Condition Isolation problem in DiT-based I2V models, enhancing text adherence while maintaining visual consistency, and provides a valuable benchmark for future research in instruction-following I2V generation.

Abstract: The task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize a video from a reference image and a text prompt. This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\%).

*Qi Zheng,Shuliang Liu,Yu Huang,Sihang Jia,Jungang Li,Lyuhao Chen,Junhao Chen,Hanqian Li,Aiwei Liu,Yibo Yan,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISA-Mark is a visual-semantic adaptive watermarking framework for LVLMs that preserves visual fidelity while maintaining detection accuracy and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods for Large Vision-Language Models have limitations: vision-agnostic watermarks disrupt visual grounding with irrelevant tokens, while semantic-aware methods suffer from high inference latency due to rejection sampling.

Method: Uses a lightweight prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights that quantify visual support for candidate tokens. These weights guide adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation, concentrating watermark strength on visually-supported tokens to preserve visual fidelity.

Result: Outperforms conventional methods with 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity. Maintains 96.88% AUC detection accuracy and 99.3% attack resilience without sacrificing inference efficiency.

Conclusion: VISA-Mark effectively establishes a new standard for reliability-preserving multimodal watermarking by actively aligning watermarks with visual evidence, preserving both visual fidelity and detection performance.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases, while some semantic-aware methods incur prohibitive inference latency due to rejection sampling. In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input. These weights guide an adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation mechanism, concentrating watermark strength specifically on visually-supported tokens. By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (96.88% AUC) and robust attack resilience (99.3%) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multimodal watermarking.

*Weidong Tang,Xinyan Wan,Siyu Li,Xiumei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR-Scaling introduces inference-time scaling for vector-quantized visual autoregressive models by mapping discrete latent spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation, enabling effective navigation of sampling distributions through a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While inference-time scaling has improved generative quality in large language and diffusion models, it hasn't been explored for vector-quantized visual autoregressive modeling due to the challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search.

Method: Map discrete latent spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces using kernel density estimation, then use a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling for high-density regions to preserve quality, and Random-k sampling for low-density areas to maintain diversity.

Result: Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process quality.

Conclusion: VAR-Scaling successfully addresses the discrete latent space challenge in VQ models, enabling effective inference-time scaling that optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling has significantly enhanced generative quality in large language and diffusion models, its application to vector-quantized (VQ) visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) remains unexplored. We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process. The code is available at https://github.com/WD7ang/VAR-Scaling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CINEMA is a human cognition-inspired framework that decomposes multi-image reasoning into five structured meta-actions to address MLLMs' poor performance in multi-image scenarios, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on single-image tasks but struggle significantly with multi-image reasoning due to complex inter-image relationships and scattered information across images. This performance gap motivates the need for a more structured approach inspired by human cognitive processes.

Method: Proposes CINEMA framework with five structured meta-actions (Global, Focus, Hint, Think, Answer) mimicking human cognitive steps. Uses Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling for cold-start training to generate reasoning patterns, followed by two-stage RL: exploration with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to prevent entropy collapse, then annealed exploitation with DAPO. Trained on 57k cold-start and 58k RL instances across multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks.

Result: Achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Surpasses GPT-4o on MUIR and MVMath benchmarks, and outperforms specialized video reasoning models on video understanding benchmarks. Demonstrates effectiveness and generalizability of the human cognition-inspired framework.

Conclusion: The CINEMA framework successfully addresses multi-image reasoning challenges by structuring the cognitive process into explicit meta-actions, leading to superior performance across diverse multimodal reasoning tasks and validating the value of human cognition-inspired approaches in MLLM development.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at single-image understanding, they exhibit significantly degraded performance in multi-image reasoning scenarios. Multi-image reasoning presents fundamental challenges including complex inter-relationships between images and scattered critical information across image sets. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose the Cognition-Inspired Meta-Action Framework (CINEMA), a novel approach that decomposes multi-image reasoning into five structured meta-actions: Global, Focus, Hint, Think, and Answer which explicitly modeling the sequential cognitive steps humans naturally employ. For cold-start training, we introduce a Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling strategy that generates high-quality meta-action trajectories to bootstrap the model with reasoning patterns. During reinforcement learning, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: an exploration phase with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to avoid entropy collapse, followed by an annealed exploitation phase with DAPO to gradually strengthen exploitation. To train our model, we construct a dataset of 57k cold-start and 58k reinforcement learning instances spanning multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks. We conduct extensive evaluations on multi-image reasoning benchmarks, video understanding benchmarks, and single-image benchmarks, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance on several key benchmarks. Our model surpasses GPT-4o on the MUIR and MVMath benchmarks and notably outperforms specialized video reasoning models on video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our human cognition-inspired reasoning framework.

*Zhongming Liu,Bingbing Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of channel-spatial attention fusion strategies reveals data-scale dependent performance patterns, with different topologies optimal for few-shot, medium-scale, and large-scale tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on channel and spatial attention fusion strategies lacks systematic analysis and unified principles, with selection processes being largely empirical rather than principled.

Method: Built an evaluation suite of 18 attention topologies across four classes (sequential, parallel, multi-scale, residual) and systematically compared them across two vision and nine medical datasets under a unified framework.

Result: Discovered a "data scale-method-performance" coupling law: 1) few-shot tasks: "Channel-Multi-scale Spatial" cascaded structure works best; 2) medium-scale tasks: parallel learnable fusion architectures are superior; 3) large-scale tasks: parallel structures with dynamic gating yield optimal performance. Also found "Spatial-Channel" order is more stable for fine-grained classification, and residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradients.

Conclusion: Proposed scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules based on data scale, with code open-sourced to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a core component of deep learning models, with Channel Attention and Spatial Attention being the two most representative architectures. Current research on their fusion strategies primarily bifurcates into sequential and parallel paradigms, yet the selection process remains largely empirical, lacking systematic analysis and unified principles. We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a "data scale-method-performance" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the "Channel-Multi-scale Spatial" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the "Spatial-Channel" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DWlzm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSCAR is a training-free method for open-set CAD model retrieval using language prompts and single images, outperforming SOTA on cross-domain 3D model retrieval and enabling automated model sourcing for 6D pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot object pose estimation requires CAD models, but obtaining specific models for continuously changing object sets is challenging. There's a need for reliable retrieval of matching object models from unlabeled 3D databases without training.

Method: Two-stage retrieval: 1) Preprocess database models with multi-view renderings and caption generation. 2) At inference: use GroundedSAM for object detection, then text-based filtering with CLIP to identify candidates, followed by image-based refinement with DINOv2 for final selection.

Result: Outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on MI3DOR benchmark; achieves 90.48% average precision on YCB-V dataset; enables effective pose estimation using similar models when exact instances aren't available.

Conclusion: OSCAR provides effective open-set CAD retrieval without training, enabling automated model sourcing for 6D pose estimation and demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in cross-domain retrieval tasks.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation plays a crucial role in scene understanding for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical multi-modal models focus on specialized image analysis but fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical diagnostics involving heterogeneous inputs and ongoing contextual understanding during patient-physician interactions.

Method: 1) Constructed MediScope dataset with 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images across 10+ clinical departments; 2) Developed PulseMind Benchmark with four-dimensional evaluation (proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, language quality); 3) Designed training framework with Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO) using relative preference signals.

Result: PulseMind achieves competitive performance on both the diagnostic consultation benchmark and public medical benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in handling real-world clinical diagnostic scenarios.

Conclusion: PulseMind bridges the gap between specialized medical AI models and real-world clinical diagnostics by integrating systematic data curation, comprehensive evaluation, and human-aligned training, enabling more realistic patient-physician interaction modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical multi-modal models focus on specialized image analysis like dermatology, pathology, or radiology. However, they do not fully capture the complexity of real-world clinical diagnostics, which involve heterogeneous inputs and require ongoing contextual understanding during patient-physician interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PulseMind, a new family of multi-modal diagnostic models that integrates a systematically curated dataset, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, and a tailored training framework. Specifically, we first construct a diagnostic dataset, MediScope, which comprises 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images, spanning over 10 major clinical departments and more than 200 sub-specialties. Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO). Compared to absolute score rewards, CRPO uses relative preference signals from multi-dimensional com-parisons to provide stable and human-aligned training guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseMind achieves competitive performance on both the diagnostic consultation benchmark and public medical benchmarks.

TL;DR: DualPD is a training-free decoding refinement strategy that fixes MLLMs' "seeing right but saying wrong" problem by comparing layer-wise attention shifts and filtering noisy attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show strong vision-language capabilities but suffer from internal inconsistency: deeper layers attend to correct visual regions while final predictions get misled by noisy attention from earlier layers, creating a disconnect between internal understanding and final output.

Method: DualPD has two components: (1) layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module that tracks belief evolution by comparing output logits between layers with largest attention shifts, and (2) head-wise information filtering module that suppresses low-contribution attention heads focusing on irrelevant regions.

Result: Experiments on LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks show DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: DualPD effectively addresses the "seeing right but saying wrong" problem in MLLMs through dual-perspective decoding refinement, enhancing visual understanding without additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, their internal reasoning often exhibits a critical inconsistency: although deeper layers may attend to the correct visual regions, final predictions are frequently misled by noisy attention from earlier layers. This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability. The code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to unify fine-grained visual perception with coherent story organization for e-commerce video narration. E-commerce videos are fast-paced, information-dense, and have visual tokens dominating input sequences.

Method: 1) E-HVC dataset with Temporal Chain-of-Thought (event-level) and Chapter Summary annotations; 2) Staged construction: gather ASR/frame evidence, refine into precise chapter boundaries; 3) SPA-Compressor: compresses multimodal tokens into hierarchical scene/event representations using ASR cues; 4) HiVid-Narrator framework.

Result: Superior narrative quality with fewer input tokens compared to existing methods. Achieves fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives through the proposed dataset and compression approach.

Conclusion: The E-HVC dataset and HiVid-Narrator framework effectively address e-commerce video narration challenges by combining staged annotation construction with efficient multimodal token compression, enabling better story organization while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Generating structured narrations for real-world e-commerce videos requires models to perceive fine-grained visual details and organize them into coherent, high-level stories--capabilities that existing approaches struggle to unify. We introduce the E-commerce Hierarchical Video Captioning (E-HVC) dataset with dual-granularity, temporally grounded annotations: a Temporal Chain-of-Thought that anchors event-level observations and Chapter Summary that compose them into concise, story-centric summaries. Rather than directly prompting chapters, we adopt a staged construction that first gathers reliable linguistic and visual evidence via curated ASR and frame-level descriptions, then refines coarse annotations into precise chapter boundaries and titles conditioned on the Temporal Chain-of-Thought, yielding fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives. We also observe that e-commerce videos are fast-paced and information-dense, with visual tokens dominating the input sequence. To enable efficient training while reducing input tokens, we propose the Scene-Primed ASR-anchored Compressor (SPA-Compressor), which compresses multimodal tokens into hierarchical scene and event representations guided by ASR semantic cues. Built upon these designs, our HiVid-Narrator framework achieves superior narrative quality with fewer input tokens compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: DiCo introduces a dynamic collaborative network for semi-supervised 3D vessel segmentation where teacher and student models dynamically switch roles, with multi-view integration and adversarial supervision for shape constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional mean teacher methods use fixed teacher-student roles, but in complex 3D vessel data, the teacher may not always outperform the student, leading to cognitive biases that limit segmentation performance.

Method: Proposes a dynamic collaborative network allowing two models to dynamically switch teacher-student roles, a multi-view integration module to capture various input perspectives, and adversarial supervision to constrain vessel shapes in unlabeled data using 2D projections to mitigate label inconsistencies.

Result: DiCo achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three 3D vessel segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The dynamic collaborative approach with role switching, multi-view integration, and adversarial supervision effectively addresses limitations of conventional mean teacher methods for 3D vessel segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new dynamic collaborative network for semi-supervised 3D vessel segmentation, termed DiCo. Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies. Experiments demonstrate that our DiCo method sets new state-of-the-art performance on three 3D vessel segmentation benchmarks. The code repository address is https://github.com/xujiaommcome/DiCo

Motivation: Diffusion Transformer models have high-quality image/video generation but suffer from slow iterative sampling due to computational costs. Existing caching methods treat all feature components uniformly, failing to account for different temporal behaviors in feature subspaces.

Method: Proposes SVD-Cache: decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) into principal and residual subspaces. Applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank principal components that evolve smoothly, while directly reusing the volatile residual subspace components.

Result: Achieves near-lossless quality across diverse models and methods, including 5.55× speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo. Compatible with other acceleration techniques like distillation, quantization, and sparse attention.

Conclusion: SVD-Cache effectively accelerates DiT inference by exploiting the distinct temporal behaviors of different feature subspaces, offering a practical solution for real-time diffusion model applications.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have achieved unprecedented quality in image and video generation, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally prohibitive. To accelerate inference, feature caching methods have emerged by reusing intermediate representations across timesteps. However, existing caching approaches treat all feature components uniformly. We reveal that DiT feature spaces contain distinct principal and residual subspaces with divergent temporal behavior: the principal subspace evolves smoothly and predictably, while the residual subspace exhibits volatile, low-energy oscillations that resist accurate prediction. Building on this insight, we propose SVD-Cache, a subspace-aware caching framework that decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank components, and directly reuses the residual subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SVD-Cache achieves near-lossless across diverse models and methods, including 5.55$\times$ speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo, and compatibility with model acceleration techniques including distillation, quantization and sparse attention. Our code is in supplementary material and will be released on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification faces challenges from high spectral dimensionality and limited labeled data, causing traditional deep learning models to overfit and incur high computational costs. Self-distillation offers a promising alternative that doesn't require external teacher networks.

Method: Apply self-distillation to HSI classification by treating earlier network outputs as soft targets, enforcing consistency between intermediate and final predictions to improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in the feature space.

Result: Validated on two benchmark HSI datasets, the approach demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness, highlighting SD's effectiveness for spectral-spatial learning.

Conclusion: Self-distillation is an effective strategy for HSI classification that enhances model performance without requiring external teacher networks, improving feature space organization and overall classification quality.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents unique challenges due to its high spectral dimensionality and limited labeled data. Traditional deep learning models often suffer from overfitting and high computational costs. Self-distillation (SD), a variant of knowledge distillation where a network learns from its own predictions, has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance model performance without requiring external teacher networks. In this work, we explore the application of SD to HSI by treating earlier outputs as soft targets, thereby enforcing consistency between intermediate and final predictions. This process improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in the learned feature space. Our approach is validated on two benchmark HSI datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of SD for spectral-spatial learning.

TL;DR: PanoSAMic adapts SAM for panoramic semantic segmentation using multi-modal fusion and spherical attention to handle distortions, achieving SotA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image foundation models are optimized for perspective images, not spherical/panoramic images which have distortions and edge discontinuity issues. There's a need for specialized models that can effectively process panoramic images using multiple modalities.

Method: Integrates pre-trained SAM encoder, modifies it to output multi-stage features, introduces spatio-modal fusion module to select relevant modalities and best features for different areas, and uses semantic decoder with spherical attention and dual view fusion to handle panoramic distortions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Stanford2D3DS for RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-D-N modalities, and on Matterport3D for RGB and RGB-D modalities.

Conclusion: PanoSAMic successfully adapts foundation models for panoramic semantic segmentation, effectively handling spherical distortions through specialized fusion and attention mechanisms while leveraging pre-trained SAM capabilities.

Abstract: Existing image foundation models are not optimized for spherical images having been trained primarily on perspective images. PanoSAMic integrates the pre-trained Segment Anything (SAM) encoder to make use of its extensive training and integrate it into a semantic segmentation model for panoramic images using multiple modalities. We modify the SAM encoder to output multi-stage features and introduce a novel spatio-modal fusion module that allows the model to select the relevant modalities and best features from each modality for different areas of the input. Furthermore, our semantic decoder uses spherical attention and dual view fusion to overcome the distortions and edge discontinuity often associated with panoramic images. PanoSAMic achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) results on Stanford2D3DS for RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-D-N modalities and on Matterport3D for RGB and RGB-D modalities. https://github.com/dfki-av/PanoSAMic

### [251] [Improving Video Question Answering through query-based frame selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07459)
*Himanshu Patil,Geo Jolly,Ramana Raja Buddala,Ganesh Ramakrishnan,Rohit Saluja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a query-based frame selection method using submodular mutual information functions to replace uniform sampling in VideoQA, improving accuracy by up to 4% on MVBench dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA models use uniform frame sampling which doesn't capture important frames or video context, leading to suboptimal performance. There's a need for smarter frame selection that aligns with the specific question being asked.

Method: Proposes query-based frame selection using submodular mutual information (SMI) functions to select frames relevant to the question. This ensures chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA.

Result: Achieved up to 4% accuracy improvement over uniform sampling on MVBench dataset using Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT models. Qualitative analysis shows query-based selection consistently picks frames better aligned with questions.

Conclusion: Query-based frame selection using SMI functions significantly enhances VideoQA accuracy by selecting more relevant frames. This approach can benefit various tasks that rely on video frame subsets.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models enhance understanding and interaction with audiovisual content, making it more accessible, searchable, and useful for a wide range of fields such as education, surveillance, entertainment, and content creation. Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \textbf{4\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling. Qualitative analysis further highlights that query-based selection, using SMI functions, consistently picks frames better aligned with the question. We opine that such query-based frame selection can enhance accuracy in a wide range of tasks that rely on only a subset of video frames.

*Shikang Zheng,Guantao Chen,Lixuan He,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Chang Zou,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fresco is a dynamic resolution framework for accelerating Diffusion Transformers that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, achieving near-lossless acceleration with up to 10× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic resolution sampling methods for Diffusion Transformers have two key problems: 1) heuristic re-noising at resolution transitions breaks cross-stage consistency and forces models to relearn global structure, and 2) indiscriminate upsampling of the entire latent space causes accumulated errors and visible artifacts.

Method: Fresco proposes a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling. It preserves both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target.

Result: Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10× speedup on FLUX and 5× on HunyuanVideo. It remains orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22× speedup when combined with distilled models.

Conclusion: Fresco provides an effective dynamic resolution framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by maintaining cross-stage consistency and using progressive upsampling, enabling significant acceleration without quality loss.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers achieve impressive generative quality but remain computationally expensive due to iterative sampling. Recently, dynamic resolution sampling has emerged as a promising acceleration technique by reducing the resolution of early sampling steps. However, existing methods rely on heuristic re-noising at every resolution transition, injecting noise that breaks cross-stage consistency and forces the model to relearn global structure. In addition, these methods indiscriminately upsample the entire latent space at once without checking which regions have actually converged, causing accumulated errors, and visible artifacts. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Fresco}, a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, preserving both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target. Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10$\times$ speedup on FLUX, and 5$\times$ on HunyuanVideo, while remaining orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22$\times$ speedup when combined with distilled models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocalOrder framework addresses positional disparity in reading order detection by using focal preference optimization to focus on hard-to-learn layout transitions, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reading order detection methods assume uniform difficulty across layout regions, but suffer from "Positional Disparity" - models perform well on easy start/end regions but collapse on complex intermediate sections due to easy patterns drowning out learning signals from difficult layouts.

Method: FocalOrder framework with Focal Preference Optimization (FPO): 1) Adaptive difficulty discovery with exponential moving average to dynamically identify hard-to-learn transitions, 2) Difficulty-calibrated pairwise ranking objective to enforce global logical consistency.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art results on OmniDocBench v1.0 and Comp-HRDoc benchmarks. Compact model outperforms specialized baselines and significantly surpasses large-scale general vision-language models.

Conclusion: Aligning optimization with intrinsic structural ambiguity of documents is critical for mastering complex document structures. The proposed focal preference optimization effectively addresses positional disparity in reading order detection.

Abstract: Reading order detection is the foundation of document understanding. Most existing methods rely on uniform supervision, implicitly assuming a constant difficulty distribution across layout regions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by revealing a critical flaw: \textbf{Positional Disparity}, a phenomenon where models demonstrate mastery over the deterministic start and end regions but suffer a performance collapse in the complex intermediate sections. This degradation arises because standard training allows the massive volume of easy patterns to drown out the learning signals from difficult layouts. To address this, we propose \textbf{FocalOrder}, a framework driven by \textbf{Focal Preference Optimization (FPO)}. Specifically, FocalOrder employs adaptive difficulty discovery with exponential moving average mechanism to dynamically pinpoint hard-to-learn transitions, while introducing a difficulty-calibrated pairwise ranking objective to enforce global logical consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FocalOrder establishes new state-of-the-art results on OmniDocBench v1.0 and Comp-HRDoc. Our compact model not only outperforms competitive specialized baselines but also significantly surpasses large-scale general VLMs. These results demonstrate that aligning the optimization with intrinsic structural ambiguity of documents is critical for mastering complex document structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AACNet is a coarse-to-fine 3D tooth segmentation framework for CBCT scans that addresses adhesion artifacts through ambiguity gating and signed distance map guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D tooth segmentation from CBCT is essential for digital dentistry but challenging due to adhesion artifacts caused by low contrast and indistinct boundaries in occluded scans.

Method: Proposes Anatomy Aware Cascade Network (AACNet) with two key mechanisms: Ambiguity Gated Boundary Refiner (AGBR) using entropy-based gating for uncertain transition zones, and Signed Distance Map guided Anatomical Attention (SDMAA) for topological consistency.

Result: Achieves Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.17% and 95% Hausdorff Distance of 3.63mm on 125 CBCT volumes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Shows strong generalization with HD95 of 2.19mm on external dataset.

Conclusion: AACNet effectively resolves boundary ambiguity in CBCT tooth segmentation while maintaining structural consistency, demonstrating reliability for clinical applications like surgical planning.

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) tooth segmentation from Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a prerequisite for digital dental workflows. However, achieving high-fidelity segmentation remains challenging due to adhesion artifacts in naturally occluded scans, which are caused by low contrast and indistinct inter-arch boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose the Anatomy Aware Cascade Network (AACNet), a coarse-to-fine framework designed to resolve boundary ambiguity while maintaining global structural consistency. Specifically, we introduce two mechanisms: the Ambiguity Gated Boundary Refiner (AGBR) and the Signed Distance Map guided Anatomical Attention (SDMAA). The AGBR employs an entropy based gating mechanism to perform targeted feature rectification in high uncertainty transition zones. Meanwhile, the SDMAA integrates implicit geometric constraints via signed distance map to enforce topological consistency, preventing the loss of spatial details associated with standard pooling. Experimental results on a dataset of 125 CBCT volumes demonstrate that AACNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.17 \% and a 95\% Hausdorff Distance of 3.63 mm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization on an external dataset with an HD95 of 2.19 mm, validating its reliability for downstream clinical applications such as surgical planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing immersive telepresence systems require multi-camera setups and high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting real-time performance on mobile devices. There's a need for simpler, more efficient solutions.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Offline multi-view reconstruction to build user-specific 3DGS avatar, 2) Real-time monocular inference using single RGB camera to capture motion/expressions. Features transmitted via WebRTC data channel, with lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network on receiver side for dynamic adjustments.

Result: Achieves PSNR >28 dB for novel poses, end-to-end latency ~80 ms, >1000x bandwidth reduction vs point-cloud streaming, operates at ~60 FPS on Meta Quest 3 with <0.2 Mbps bandwidth.

Conclusion: Mon3tr enables practical, high-quality immersive telepresence on mobile devices by combining 3DGS parametric modeling with efficient monocular capture and transmission, overcoming hardware and bandwidth limitations of existing systems.

Abstract: Immersive telepresence aims to transform human interaction in AR/VR applications by enabling lifelike full-body holographic representations for enhanced remote collaboration. However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems need realistic simulators for perception and planning development, but current 3D reconstruction techniques like Gaussian Splatting produce artifacts in novel views, especially with sparse observations or extrapolated perspectives.

Method: ViewMorpher3D uses image diffusion models to jointly process rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent/spatially overlapping reference views to infer missing details, suppress artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.

Result: Experiments on real-world driving datasets show substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: ViewMorpher3D provides an adaptable framework for enhancing multi-view image realism in driving simulations, supporting variable camera setups and flexible view configurations to improve autonomous driving system development.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multi-view images to ensure accurate perception and robust decision-making. To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse.
  We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.
  Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups.

Abstract: Food image segmentation is a critical task for dietary analysis, enabling accurate estimation of food volume and nutrients. However, current methods suffer from limited multi-view data and poor generalization to new viewpoints. We introduce BenchSeg, a novel multi-view food video segmentation dataset and benchmark. BenchSeg aggregates 55 dish scenes (from Nutrition5k, Vegetables & Fruits, MetaFood3D, and FoodKit) with 25,284 meticulously annotated frames, capturing each dish under free 360° camera motion. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames. Our best model based on a combination of SeTR-MLA+XMem2 outperforms prior work (e.g., improving over FoodMem by ~2.63% mAP), offering new insights into food segmentation and tracking for dietary analysis.

Conclusion: Foundation model-based pipelines can support robust and interpretable CRLM detection and classification across heterogeneous CT data, demonstrating clinical utility with uncertainty-aware decision support.

Abstract: Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) are a major cause of cancer-related mortality, and reliable detection on CT remains challenging in multi-centre settings. We developed a foundation model-based AI pipeline for patient-level classification and lesion-level detection of CRLM on contrast-enhanced CT, integrating uncertainty quantification and explainability. CT data from the EuCanImage consortium (n=2437) and an external TCIA cohort (n=197) were used. Among several pretrained models, UMedPT achieved the best performance and was fine-tuned with an MLP head for classification and an FCOS-based head for lesion detection. The classification model achieved an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.82 on the combined test set, with a sensitivity of 0.85 on the external cohort. Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40. The detection model identified 69.1 percent of lesions overall, increasing from 30 percent to 98 percent across lesion size quartiles. Grad-CAM highlighted lesion-corresponding regions in high-confidence cases. These results demonstrate that foundation model-based pipelines can support robust and interpretable CRLM detection and classification across heterogeneous CT data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPAD signals have nonlinear, stochastic relationships with photon flux, requiring proper statistical modeling to enable accurate inverse problem solving in imaging applications.

Method: Derive likelihood function for raw SPAD signals given fixed photon flux, then derive score function of the signal, and apply diffusion models to express image priors for solving inverse problems.

Result: Developed statistical framework for SPAD signals enabling inverse problem solving, demonstrated effects of low/high photon counts and benefits of utilizing detection event timing information.

Conclusion: The derived likelihood and score functions provide key mathematical foundations for solving SPAD-based inverse problems using diffusion models, with timing information offering significant advantages.

Abstract: We derive the likelihood of a raw signal in a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD), given a fixed photon flux. The raw signal comprises timing of detection events, which are nonlinearly related to the flux. Moreover, they are naturally stochastic. We then derive a score function of the signal. This is a key for solving inverse problems based on SPAD signals. We focus on deriving solutions involving a diffusion model, to express image priors. We demonstrate the effect of low or high photon counts, and the consequence of exploiting timing of detection events.

TL;DR: UIKA is a feed-forward animatable Gaussian head model that can create avatars from various inputs (single image, multi-view, videos) without requiring studio capture systems or lengthy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional avatar methods require studio-level multi-view capture systems and lengthy optimization processes, limiting accessibility and efficiency. The authors aim to create a more practical solution that works with readily available inputs like single images or smartphone videos.

Method: 1) UV-guided avatar modeling with pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation to reproject colors from screen to UV space; 2) Learnable UV tokens with attention mechanisms at both screen and UV levels; 3) Large-scale synthetic training dataset preparation for identity-rich training.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings, demonstrating superior performance across different input types.

Conclusion: UIKA provides an efficient, feed-forward approach to animatable head modeling that works with practical input sources, overcoming limitations of traditional studio-based avatar creation methods.

Abstract: We present UIKA, a feed-forward animatable Gaussian head model from an arbitrary number of unposed inputs, including a single image, multi-view captures, and smartphone-captured videos. Unlike the traditional avatar method, which requires a studio-level multi-view capture system and reconstructs a human-specific model through a long-time optimization process, we rethink the task through the lenses of model representation, network design, and data preparation. First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings. Project page: https://zijian-wu.github.io/uika-page/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARL is a vision-only document layout analysis framework that eliminates OCR dependency, using positional awareness and relational learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters than multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal methods rely on OCR, which introduces text recognition errors and computational overhead, limiting robustness and practical applicability. The authors argue that effective layout analysis depends on understanding visual structure rather than text-visual fusion.

Method: PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network) is an OCR-free, vision-only framework with two key components: 1) Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed positional dependencies into visual features, and 2) Graph Refinement Classifier (GRC) that refines predictions using a dynamically constructed layout graph modeling contextual relationships.

Result: PARL achieves state-of-the-art results, establishing new benchmarks for vision-only methods on DocLayNet and surpassing even strong multimodal models on M6Doc. It's highly efficient with 65M parameters (4x fewer than 256M multimodal models).

Conclusion: Sophisticated visual structure modeling can be more efficient and robust than multimodal fusion for document layout analysis, demonstrating that OCR-free vision-only approaches can outperform text-dependent methods while being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: Document layout analysis aims to detect and categorize structural elements (e.g., titles, tables, figures) in scanned or digital documents. Popular methods often rely on high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to merge visual features with extracted text. This dependency introduces two major drawbacks: propagation of text recognition errors and substantial computational overhead, limiting the robustness and practical applicability of multimodal approaches. In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure. Specifically, we first introduce a Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed explicit positional dependencies among layout elements directly into visual features. Second, we design a Graph Refinement Classifier (GRC) to refine predictions by modeling contextual relationships through a dynamically constructed layout graph. Extensive experiments show PARL achieves state-of-the-art results. It establishes a new benchmark for vision-only methods on DocLayNet and, notably, surpasses even strong multimodal models on M6Doc. Crucially, PARL (65M) is highly efficient, using roughly four times fewer parameters than large multimodal models (256M), demonstrating that sophisticated visual structure modeling can be both more efficient and robust than multimodal fusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that enforces orthogonality on both motion codebook and LLM embedding space to align motion geometry with semantic embedding for better motion-language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion tokenization pipelines decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them only via token IDs. This fails to align the intrinsic geometry of motion space with embedding space, hindering LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning.

Method: 1) Uses decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. 2) Employs sparse projection to map motion codes into LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. 3) Implements two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule for soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: A unified geometric basis effectively empowers LLMs for nuanced motion reasoning by aligning motion space geometry with embedding space structure.

Abstract: Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.

TL;DR: StdGEN++ is a system that generates high-fidelity 3D characters with semantic decomposition from various inputs, enabling production-ready assets with editable components for gaming/animation pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative methods produce monolithic meshes lacking structural flexibility needed for industrial pipelines in gaming and animation, creating a gap for production-ready character assets.

Method: Uses Dual-branch Semantic-aware Large Reconstruction Model (Dual-Branch S-LRM) for joint geometry/color/semantics reconstruction, semantic surface extraction with hybrid implicit fields, coarse-to-fine proposal scheme for memory efficiency, and video-diffusion-based texture decomposition for appearance disentanglement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement, significantly outperforming existing methods, and enables advanced downstream capabilities like non-destructive editing, physics-compliant animation, and gaze tracking.

Conclusion: StdGEN++ provides a robust solution for automated character asset production with structural independence that unlocks practical applications in gaming and animation pipelines.

Abstract: We present StdGEN++, a novel and comprehensive system for generating high-fidelity, semantically decomposed 3D characters from diverse inputs. Existing 3D generative methods often produce monolithic meshes that lack the structural flexibility required by industrial pipelines in gaming and animation. Addressing this gap, StdGEN++ is built upon a Dual-branch Semantic-aware Large Reconstruction Model (Dual-Branch S-LRM), which jointly reconstructs geometry, color, and per-component semantics in a feed-forward manner. To achieve production-level fidelity, we introduce a novel semantic surface extraction formalism compatible with hybrid implicit fields. This mechanism is accelerated by a coarse-to-fine proposal scheme, which significantly reduces memory footprint and enables high-resolution mesh generation. Furthermore, we propose a video-diffusion-based texture decomposition module that disentangles appearance into editable layers (e.g., separated iris and skin), resolving semantic confusion in facial regions. Experiments demonstrate that StdGEN++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement. Crucially, the resulting structural independence unlocks advanced downstream capabilities, including non-destructive editing, physics-compliant animation, and gaze tracking, making it a robust solution for automated character asset production.

TL;DR: A variational contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition that combines probabilistic latent modeling with contrastive learning to capture motion variability and uncertainty, outperforming existing methods especially with limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition are inherently discriminative and struggle to capture the variability and uncertainty intrinsic to human motion. There's a need for methods that can learn more structured and semantically meaningful representations that generalize better across datasets and supervision levels.

Method: Proposes a variational contrastive learning framework that integrates probabilistic latent modeling with contrastive self-supervised learning. This approach combines the benefits of both paradigms to learn structured representations that capture motion uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments on three widely used skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show consistent outperformance over existing approaches, particularly in low-label regimes. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned features are more relevant to motion characteristics and focus more on important skeleton joints compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The variational contrastive learning framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional contrastive methods by capturing motion variability and uncertainty, leading to more meaningful representations that generalize well across different datasets and supervision levels, especially when labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition has advanced with the development of contrastive learning methods. However, most of contrastive paradigms are inherently discriminative and often struggle to capture the variability and uncertainty intrinsic to human motion. To address this issue, we propose a variational contrastive learning framework that integrates probabilistic latent modeling with contrastive self-supervised learning. This formulation enables the learning of structured and semantically meaningful representations that generalize across different datasets and supervision levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in low-label regimes. Moreover, qualitative analyses show that the features provided by our method are more relevant given the motion and sample characteristics, with more focus on important skeleton joints, when compared to the other methods.

Conclusion: Comprehensive integration of synthetic data generation methods significantly enhances LPR performance, addresses data scarcity issues, and identifies optimal accuracy-speed trade-offs for practical applications.

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition is a frequent research topic due to its wide-ranging practical applications. While recent studies use synthetic images to improve License Plate Recognition (LPR) results, there remain several limitations in these efforts. This work addresses these constraints by comprehensively exploring the integration of real and synthetic data to enhance LPR performance. We subject 16 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models to a benchmarking process involving 12 public datasets acquired from various regions. Several key findings emerge from our investigation. Primarily, the massive incorporation of synthetic data substantially boosts model performance in both intra- and cross-dataset scenarios. We examine three distinct methodologies for generating synthetic data: template-based generation, character permutation, and utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, each contributing significantly to performance enhancement. The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and speed among different models, identifying those that strike the optimal balance in each intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR data scarcity limits 3D scene generation for robotics tasks like autonomous driving. Existing methods struggle with limited 3D datasets compared to abundant RGB data.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) Align generative model features with self-supervised 3D features, (2) Transfer knowledge from large-scale image-pretrained models to LiDAR generation, (3) Enable point cloud control for object inpainting and scene mixing with unconditional model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 benchmark. The method effectively mitigates LiDAR data limitations while enabling flexible scene manipulation.

Conclusion: R3DPA successfully bridges the gap between image and LiDAR domains, demonstrating that leveraging image-pretrained priors and self-supervised 3D representations enables high-quality LiDAR scene generation despite data scarcity.

Abstract: LiDAR scene synthesis is an emerging solution to scarcity in 3D data for robotic tasks such as autonomous driving. Recent approaches employ diffusion or flow matching models to generate realistic scenes, but 3D data remains limited compared to RGB datasets with millions of samples. We introduce R3DPA, the first LiDAR scene generation method to unlock image-pretrained priors for LiDAR point clouds, and leverage self-supervised 3D representations for state-of-the-art results. Specifically, we (i) align intermediate features of our generative model with self-supervised 3D features, which substantially improves generation quality; (ii) transfer knowledge from large-scale image-pretrained generative models to LiDAR generation, mitigating limited LiDAR datasets; and (iii) enable point cloud control at inference for object inpainting and scene mixing with solely an unconditional model. On the KITTI-360 benchmark R3DPA achieves state of the art performance. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/R3DPA.

TL;DR: AP-GRPO framework with SNRA operator solves reward sparsity in VLMs for 3D scene understanding by transforming raw feedback into dense rewards and preserving absolute numerical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with precise numerical prediction for 3D scene understanding due to reward sparsity and gradient instability in traditional RL approaches. Relative normalization causes "near-miss" samples to suffer from advantage collapse, creating a data utilization bottleneck.

Method: Introduces Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator using dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into dense continuous rewards, and Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework that integrates absolute scalar gradients to prevent numerical information loss.

Result: Created Numerical3D-50k dataset with 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without architectural modifications.

Conclusion: The AP-GRPO framework with SNRA operator successfully addresses reward sparsity in 3D scene understanding for VLMs, enabling precise numerical prediction while maintaining data efficiency and requiring no model architecture changes.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical bottleneck in achieving precise numerical prediction for 3D scene understanding. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes "near-miss" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications.

### [268] [Hidden Monotonicity: Explaining Deep Neural Networks via their DC Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07700)
*Jakob Paul Zimmermann,Georg Loho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows how monotonicity can boost neural network explainability in two ways: 1) decomposing trained ReLU networks into monotone convex parts to create improved saliency methods, and 2) training models as differences between monotone networks for self-explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While monotonicity improves explainability in neural networks, not all functions can be approximated by monotone networks. The paper aims to leverage monotonicity to enhance explainability despite this limitation.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Adapt decomposition of trained ReLU networks into two monotone convex parts, overcoming numerical weight blowup issues. 2) Train models as differences between two monotone neural networks.

Result: Proposed saliency methods (SplitCAM and SplitLRP) outperform state-of-the-art on VGG16 and Resnet18 networks on ImageNet-S across all Quantus saliency metric categories. Models trained as differences between monotone networks exhibit strong self-explainability properties.

Conclusion: Monotonicity can significantly boost neural network explainability through decomposition techniques and architectural design, enabling improved saliency methods and self-explainable models even when functions cannot be fully approximated by monotone networks.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated in various contexts that monotonicity leads to better explainability in neural networks. However, not every function can be well approximated by a monotone neural network. We demonstrate that monotonicity can still be used in two ways to boost explainability. First, we use an adaptation of the decomposition of a trained ReLU network into two monotone and convex parts, thereby overcoming numerical obstacles from an inherent blowup of the weights in this procedure. Our proposed saliency methods -- SplitCAM and SplitLRP -- improve on state of the art results on both VGG16 and Resnet18 networks on ImageNet-S across all Quantus saliency metric categories. Second, we exhibit that training a model as the difference between two monotone neural networks results in a system with strong self-explainability properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fair and comprehensive comparisons of pose estimation accuracy for fiducial markers, which requires systematic exploration of the 6 degrees of freedom space with high-fidelity synthetic images.

Method: Developed a physically-based ray tracing rendering system that uses standard camera calibration coefficients, reproduces distortions, defocus, diffraction blur, and applies sub-pixel sampling. Uses low-discrepancy sampling of 6DOF space to generate synthetic images and analyzes correlations between degrees of freedom and pose errors.

Result: The method was applied to well-known markers, revealing their strengths and weaknesses for pose estimation. The software is open source and available on GitHub.

Conclusion: The paper presents a validated framework for fair comparison of pose estimation accuracy using synthetic images with physically accurate rendering, enabling systematic evaluation of marker performance across the full 6DOF space.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for carrying fair comparisons of the accuracy of pose estimation using fiducial markers. These comparisons rely on large sets of high-fidelity synthetic images enabling deep exploration of the 6 degrees of freedom. A low-discrepancy sampling of the space allows to check the correlations between each degree of freedom and the pose errors by plotting the 36 pairs of combinations. The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image. After introducing the rendering algorithm and its experimental validation, the paper proposes a method for evaluating the pose accuracy. This method is applied to well-known markers, revealing their strengths and weaknesses for pose estimation. The code is open source and available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAIT is a new benchmark dataset that tests visual language models' ability to understand uncommon-sense action scenes through grammatically correct but semantically counter-intuitive image-text pairs, revealing significant gaps between model and human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM evaluation datasets focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, lacking tests for deep semantic understanding of uncommon-sense scenarios that require reasoning about agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility.

Method: Semi-automated process using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples, each accompanied by carefully designed multiple-choice questions for fine-grained reasoning evaluation.

Result: All evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Lightweight models show accuracy improvement after fine-tuning, demonstrating directional adaptation potential.

Conclusion: The study reveals key weaknesses in VLMs' semantic reasoning capabilities and provides diagnostic tools and research directions for developing robust models with genuine visual semantic understanding beyond superficial pattern recognition.

Abstract: We propose UAIT (Uncommon-sense Action Image-Text) dataset, a new evaluation benchmark designed to test the semantic understanding ability of visual language models (VLMs) in uncommon-sense action scenes. Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop classification methods that can focus on specific important fragments of 2D curves rather than treating the entire curve equally, particularly for applications in archaeology where certain curve segments may be more diagnostically important than others.

Method: The authors create variants of the Wasserstein distance that incorporate discrete probability measures to weight different fragments of 2D curves, allowing the classification to emphasize prescribed parts of the curves during analysis.

Result: The approach is tested through experiments on clustering analysis of 2D curves using archaeological data, demonstrating the effectiveness of focusing on specific curve fragments for classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Wasserstein distance variants with fragment-focused weighting provide an effective method for classification tasks where specific parts of 2D curves carry more diagnostic information, particularly valuable in archaeological applications.

Abstract: In this work we analyse a number of variants of the Wasserstein distance which allow to focus the classification on the prescribed parts (fragments) of classified 2D curves. These variants are based on the use of a number of discrete probability measures which reflect the importance of given fragments of curves. The performance of this approach is tested through a series of experiments related to the clustering analysis of 2D curves performed on data coming from the field of archaeology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs face a dilemma between computational costs of verbose reasoning and hallucination risks of efficient approaches. Need to balance grounding with efficiency.

Method: Chain of Evidence (CoE) framework with: 1) Evidence Grounding Module for query-guided visual evidence extraction, 2) Evidence-Anchoring Protocol with RL optimization using composite rewards for process alignment, 3) CoE-Instruct dataset with dual-annotation schema.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks (Video-MME, MVBench, VSI-Bench, etc.), significantly outperforming existing methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: CoE provides a powerful paradigm for reliable video understanding by architecturally decoupling and co-optimizing perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) face a fundamental dilemma in video reasoning: they are caught between the prohibitive computational costs of verbose reasoning and the hallucination risks of efficient, ungrounded approaches. To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art. They significantly outperform existing methods in accuracy, proving CoE to be a powerful and practical paradigm for reliable video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-Transcendence: A method that uses internal feature supervision within diffusion transformers (DiTs) to accelerate training without external pretrained models, achieving faster convergence and better quality than methods like REPA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like REPA accelerate DiT training using external semantic features from pretrained networks (e.g., DINO), but this introduces dependencies and reduces flexibility. The authors argue that DiTs themselves have the power to guide their own training.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Initially train DiT by aligning shallow features with pretrained VAE latent representations for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs). 2) Apply classifier-free guidance to intermediate features to enhance discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features are then used as supervision signals to guide new DiT training.

Result: The method achieves significant performance boost over existing self-contained methods, can surpass REPA in generation quality and convergence speed, without needing any external pretrained models. More flexible for different backbones and potentially applicable to wider range of diffusion-based generative tasks.

Conclusion: Self-Transcendence demonstrates that DiTs can effectively guide their own training using internal feature supervision, eliminating dependency on external networks while achieving superior convergence speed and generation quality.

Abstract: Recent works such as REPA have shown that guiding diffusion models with external semantic features (e.g., DINO) can significantly accelerate the training of diffusion transformers (DiTs). However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models. Our method is not only more flexible for different backbones but also has the potential to be adopted for a wider range of diffusion-based generative tasks. The source code of our method can be found at https://github.com/csslc/Self-Transcendence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESA's planned lunar missions with Argonaut lander require reliable crater detection for safe landings, as craters pose landing risks. Current automated crater detection faces challenges with varying crater sizes/shapes, illumination conditions, and rugged terrain.

Method: Propose deep-learning crater detection algorithm using OWLv2 (Vision Transformer model). Fine-tune on manually labeled IMPACT dataset of high-resolution lunar images. Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and optimize combined loss function: CIoU for localization and contrastive loss for classification.

Result: Achieve satisfactory visual results with maximum recall of 94.0% and maximum precision of 73.1% on IMPACT test dataset. Method provides reliable crater detection across challenging lunar imaging conditions.

Conclusion: The OWLv2-based approach with LoRA fine-tuning enables robust crater detection for lunar exploration, supporting ESA's safety requirements for future lunar landings and paving way for reliable crater analysis.

Abstract: The European Space Agency (ESA), driven by its ambitions on planned lunar missions with the Argonaut lander, has a profound interest in reliable crater detection, since craters pose a risk to safe lunar landings. This task is usually addressed with automated crater detection algorithms (CDA) based on deep learning techniques. It is non-trivial due to the vast amount of craters of various sizes and shapes, as well as challenging conditions such as varying illumination and rugged terrain. Therefore, we propose a deep-learning CDA based on the OWLv2 model, which is built on a Vision Transformer, that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks. For fine-tuning, we utilize a manually labeled dataset fom the IMPACT project, that provides crater annotations on high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Calibrated Data Record images. We insert trainable parameters using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy with Low-Rank Adaptation, and optimize a combined loss function consisting of Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) for localization and a contrastive loss for classification. We achieve satisfactory visual results, along with a maximum recall of 94.0% and a maximum precision of 73.1% on a test dataset from IMPACT. Our method achieves reliable crater detection across challenging lunar imaging conditions, paving the way for robust crater analysis in future lunar exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEED introduces a simple Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder paradigm for change detection that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection methods rely on complex explicit difference computation modules (subtraction/concatenation) between Siamese encoders, which can introduce information loss. The authors challenge this complexity by proposing a simpler, more effective approach.

Method: SEED uses weight-shared Siamese encoders and decoders with parameter-free feature exchange instead of explicit differencing. Feature exchange is formalized as an orthogonal permutation operator. The method can transform standard semantic segmentation models into change detectors (SEG2CD) by simply inserting the exchange mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments across 5 benchmarks (SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, CDD) and 3 backbones (SwinT, EfficientNet, ResNet) show SEED matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods despite its simplicity. The exchange mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk.

Conclusion: Simple feature exchange is sufficient for high-performance information fusion in change detection. SEED provides a robust, unified, and interpretable framework that demonstrates complex differencing modules are unnecessary for effective change detection.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection fundamentally relies on the effective fusion and discrimination of bi-temporal features. Prevailing paradigms typically utilize Siamese encoders bridged by explicit difference computation modules, such as subtraction or concatenation, to identify changes. In this work, we challenge this complexity with SEED (Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder), a streamlined paradigm that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange. By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity. Furthermore, we reveal that standard semantic segmentation models can be transformed into competitive change detectors solely by inserting this exchange mechanism, referred to as SEG2CD. The proposed paradigm offers a robust, unified, and interpretable framework for change detection, demonstrating that simple feature exchange is sufficient for high performance information fusion. Code and full training and evaluation protocols will be released at https://github.com/dyzy41/open-rscd.

TL;DR: MIMIC is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-image capabilities of Large Vision Language Models, revealing issues with cross-image aggregation and attention, with proposed data generation and attention-masking solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs have unexplored multi-image reasoning capabilities, and existing benchmarks lack comprehensive analysis of core weaknesses in multi-image understanding.

Method: Introduces MIMIC benchmark for diagnostic evaluation, proposes procedural data-generation strategy from single-image annotations, and develops attention-masking scheme based on layer-wise pattern analysis.

Result: Reveals pervasive issues: LVLMs fail to aggregate information across images and struggle with multi-concept tracking. Proposed remedies substantially improve cross-image aggregation and outperform prior state-of-the-art on multi-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: MIMIC provides comprehensive evaluation framework, identifies key weaknesses in multi-image LVLMs, and offers effective solutions through targeted data generation and attention optimization.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their proficiency in understanding and reasoning over multiple images remains largely unexplored. While existing benchmarks have initiated the evaluation of multi-image models, a comprehensive analysis of their core weaknesses and their causes is still lacking. In this work, we introduce MIMIC (Multi-Image Model Insights and Challenges), a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multi-image capabilities of LVLMs. Using MIMIC, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments that reveal pervasive issues: LVLMs often fail to aggregate information across images and struggle to track or attend to multiple concepts simultaneously. To address these failures, we propose two novel complementary remedies. On the data side, we present a procedural data-generation strategy that composes single-image annotations into rich, targeted multi-image training examples. On the optimization side, we analyze layer-wise attention patterns and derive an attention-masking scheme tailored for multi-image inputs. Experiments substantially improved cross-image aggregation, while also enhancing performance on existing multi-image benchmarks, outperforming prior state of the art across tasks. Data and code will be made available at https://github.com/anurag-198/MIMIC.

*Kewei Zhang,Ye Huang,Yufan Deng,Jincheng Yu,Junsong Chen,Huan Ling,Enze Xie,Daquan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MHLA addresses global context collapse in linear attention by preserving representational diversity through token-dimension head division, achieving linear complexity while matching softmax attention performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention offers efficient alternative to Transformer's quadratic self-attention but degrades performance due to global context collapse where models lose representational diversity, while existing fixes reintroduce computational overhead.

Method: Proposes Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA) that preserves representational diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension, maintaining linear complexity while recovering expressive power of softmax attention.

Result: Achieves significant improvements across domains: 3.6% on ImageNet classification, 6.3% on NLP, 12.6% on image generation, and 41% on video generation under same time complexity.

Conclusion: MHLA effectively addresses global context collapse in linear attention, maintaining linear complexity while achieving performance comparable to softmax attention across vision and language tasks.

Abstract: While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.

TL;DR: RefVFX is a feed-forward framework that transfers complex temporal effects from reference videos to target videos/images, addressing limitations of text-based editing for dynamic effects like lighting changes and transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods struggle with dynamic temporal effects that are difficult to describe via text prompts or static keyframes. There's a need for transferring complex video effects while preserving the input's motion and appearance.

Method: 1) Created large-scale dataset of triplets (reference effect video, input, output) using automated pipeline for video-to-video effects; 2) Augmented with image-to-video effects from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects; 3) Trained reference-conditioned model on text-to-video backbones.

Result: RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables transfer of complex temporal effects from reference videos to targets, addressing key challenges in video effect editing through novel dataset creation and reference-conditioned modeling.

Abstract: We present RefVFX, a new framework that transfers complex temporal effects from a reference video onto a target video or image in a feed-forward manner. While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

*Sayak Chakrabarty,Souradip Pal*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PixRec is a vision-language framework for sequential recommendation that incorporates both textual attributes and product images, achieving significant improvements over text-only models by leveraging visual features to distinguish similar items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based sequential recommendation approaches overlook rich visual information present in real-world scenarios like e-commerce, where product images provide crucial distinguishing features that text alone cannot capture, especially for items with similar textual descriptions.

Method: PixRec uses a vision-language model backbone with dual-tower structure and mixed training objective to jointly process image-text sequences, aligning multi-modal feature projections for both item-item and user-item interactions, trained on Amazon Reviews dataset augmented with product images.

Result: The framework achieves 3× improvement in top-rank accuracy and 40% improvement in top-10 rank accuracy over text-only recommenders, demonstrating that visual features help distinguish items with similar textual descriptions.

Conclusion: Visual information significantly enhances sequential recommendation performance, and the work outlines future directions for scaling multi-modal recommenders, improving visual-text feature fusion, and evaluating inference-time performance for real-world e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential for usage in sequential recommendation tasks through text-only models, which combine advanced prompt design, contrastive alignment, and fine-tuning on downstream domain-specific data. While effective, these approaches overlook the rich visual information present in many real-world recommendation scenarios, particularly in e-commerce. This paper proposes PixRec - a vision-language framework that incorporates both textual attributes and product images into the recommendation pipeline. Our architecture leverages a vision-language model backbone capable of jointly processing image-text sequences, maintaining a dual-tower structure and mixed training objective while aligning multi-modal feature projections for both item-item and user-item interactions. Using the Amazon Reviews dataset augmented with product images, our experiments demonstrate $3\times$ and 40% improvements in top-rank and top-10 rank accuracy over text-only recommenders respectively, indicating that visual features can help distinguish items with similar textual descriptions. Our work outlines future directions for scaling multi-modal recommenders training, enhancing visual-text feature fusion, and evaluating inference-time performance. This work takes a step toward building software systems utilizing visual information in sequential recommendation for real-world applications like e-commerce.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReinPool uses reinforcement learning to compress multi-vector embeddings into single vectors while preserving retrieval performance, achieving 746-1249× compression with 76-81% performance recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-vector embedding models provide fine-grained document representations but suffer from massive storage costs (1000× larger indices than single-vector approaches), severely limiting scalability for real-world applications.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework that learns to dynamically filter and pool multi-vector embeddings into compact representations using an inverse retrieval objective and NDCG-based rewards, without requiring manual importance annotations.

Result: Achieves 746-1249× compression of multi-vector representations into single vectors while recovering 76-81% of full multi-vector retrieval performance. Outperforms static mean pooling by 22-33% absolute NDCG@3 improvement on Vidore V2 benchmark across three vision-language models.

Conclusion: Learned selection through reinforcement learning significantly outperforms heuristic aggregation methods, enabling practical deployment of multi-vector models by dramatically reducing storage requirements while maintaining strong retrieval performance.

Abstract: Multi-vector embedding models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for document retrieval, preserving fine-grained visual and textual details through token-level representations. However, this expressiveness comes at a staggering cost: storing embeddings for every token inflates index sizes by over $1000\times$ compared to single-vector approaches, severely limiting scalability. We introduce \textbf{ReinPool}, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to dynamically filter and pool multi-vector embeddings into compact, retrieval-optimized representations. By training with an inverse retrieval objective and NDCG-based rewards, ReinPool identifies and retains only the most discriminative vectors without requiring manual importance annotations. On the Vidore V2 benchmark across three vision-language embedding models, ReinPool compresses multi-vector representations by $746$--$1249\times$ into single vectors while recovering 76--81\% of full multi-vector retrieval performance. Compared to static mean pooling baselines, ReinPool achieves 22--33\% absolute NDCG@3 improvement, demonstrating that learned selection significantly outperforms heuristic aggregation.

### [281] [L-RAG: Balancing Context and Retrieval with Entropy-Based Lazy Loading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06551)
*Sergii Voloshyn*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: L-RAG introduces an adaptive retrieval framework that uses entropy-based gating to avoid unnecessary vector database queries, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems use a "retrieve-always" approach that queries vector databases for every input, causing substantial computational overhead and latency issues in production deployments, especially for simple queries that don't require retrieval.

Method: L-RAG implements hierarchical context management with entropy-based gating: 1) queries first use compact document summaries, 2) expensive chunk retrieval only triggers when the model's predictive entropy exceeds a calibrated threshold, indicating genuine uncertainty.

Result: On SQuAD 2.0 with Phi-2: at tau=0.5, achieves 78.2% accuracy (matching standard RAG's 77.8%) with 8% retrieval reduction; at tau=1.0, 26% retrieval reduction with 76.0% accuracy. Saves 80-210ms per query when retrieval latency >500ms. Entropy distributions show significant separation between correct predictions (H=1.72) and errors (H=2.20).

Conclusion: L-RAG provides a practical, training-free approach for efficient RAG deployment with configurable accuracy-throughput trade-offs, validated by entropy as a reliable uncertainty signal for adaptive retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for grounding Large Language Model outputs in factual knowledge, effectively mitigating hallucinations. However, conventional RAG systems operate under a "retrieve-always" assumption, querying vector databases for every input regardless of query complexity. This static approach incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency, particularly problematic for high-throughput production deployments. We introduce L-RAG (Lazy Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an adaptive framework that implements hierarchical context management through entropy-based gating. L-RAG employs a two-tier architecture: queries are first processed with a compact document summary, and expensive chunk retrieval is triggered only when the model's predictive entropy exceeds a calibrated threshold, signaling genuine uncertainty. Through experiments on SQuAD 2.0 (N=500) using the Phi-2 model, we demonstrate that L-RAG provides a tunable accuracy-efficiency trade-off: at a conservative threshold (tau=0.5), L-RAG achieves 78.2% accuracy, matching Standard RAG (77.8%), with 8% retrieval reduction; at a balanced threshold (tau=1.0), retrieval reduction increases to 26% with modest accuracy trade-off (76.0%). Latency analysis shows that L-RAG saves 80-210ms per query when retrieval latency exceeds 500ms. Analysis of entropy distributions reveals statistically significant separation (p < 0.001) between correct predictions (H=1.72) and errors (H=2.20), validating entropy as a reliable uncertainty signal. L-RAG offers a practical, training-free approach toward more efficient RAG deployment, providing system architects with a configurable knob to balance accuracy and throughput requirements.

TL;DR: FinCards is a structured reranking framework for financial QA that reframes evidence selection as constraint satisfaction using finance-aware schemas, improving retrieval stability and performance without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based rerankers for financial QA over long corporate filings primarily optimize for semantic relevance, leading to unstable rankings and opaque decision-making. Financial QA requires evidence that satisfies strict constraints on entities, financial metrics, fiscal periods, and numeric values, which current approaches don't adequately address.

Method: FinCards represents filing chunks and questions using aligned schema fields (entities, metrics, periods, numeric spans) and reframes evidence selection as constraint satisfaction. It uses a multi-stage tournament reranking with stability-aware aggregation, producing auditable decision traces through deterministic field-level matching.

Result: Across two corporate filing QA benchmarks, FinCards substantially improves early-rank retrieval over both lexical and LLM-based reranking baselines while reducing ranking variance, without requiring model fine-tuning or unpredictable inference budgets.

Conclusion: FinCards demonstrates that structured, finance-aware reranking with constraint satisfaction and stability-aware aggregation can significantly improve financial evidence retrieval performance and reliability while maintaining transparency and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Proposed a high-efficiency deep joint source-channel coding method for video transmission using conditional coding with asymmetric context, feature propagation, and content-adaptive coding to mitigate error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conditional coding-based neural video compression requires predicting encoding/decoding conditions from the same reconstructed frames context, which is problematic in JSCC schemes with pseudo-analog transmission where encoder cannot infer same reconstructed frames as decoder.

Method: 1) Use asymmetric contexts for learning encoding/decoding conditions without simulated transmission pipeline; 2) Feature propagation allows independent feature propagation at encoder/decoder to generate conditions; 3) Content-adaptive coding with entropy models and masking for variable bandwidth transmission.

Result: Outperforms existing deep video transmission frameworks, effectively mitigates error accumulation, reduces frequency of intra-frame coding modes insertion, and enhances overall performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the asymmetric context problem in JSCC video transmission, leverages temporal correlation while mitigating error accumulation, and achieves superior performance through adaptive coding mechanisms.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-efficiency deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method for video transmission based on conditional coding with asymmetric context. The conditional coding-based neural video compression requires to predict the encoding and decoding conditions from the same context which includes the same reconstructed frames. However in JSCC schemes which fall into pseudo-analog transmission, the encoder cannot infer the same reconstructed frames as the decoder even a pipeline of the simulated transmission is constructed at the encoder. In the proposed method, without such a pipeline, we guide and design neural networks to learn encoding and decoding conditions from asymmetric contexts. Additionally, we introduce feature propagation, which allows intermediate features to be independently propagated at the encoder and decoder and help to generate conditions, enabling the framework to greatly leverage temporal correlation while mitigating the problem of error accumulation. To further exploit the performance of the proposed transmission framework, we implement content-adaptive coding which achieves variable bandwidth transmission using entropy models and masking mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep video transmission frameworks in terms of performance and effectively mitigates the error accumulation. By mitigating the error accumulation, our schemes can reduce the frequency of inserting intra-frame coding modes, further enhancing performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To experimentally compare fixed transforms (DCT, Hadamard) vs. data-driven PCA for block-based image compression, understanding when learned transforms actually outperform classical methods.

Method: Experimental comparison using rate-distortion and energy compaction analysis across multiple block sizes and compression rates.

Result: PCA outperforms fixed transforms only when block dimensionality is sufficiently large; DCT remains near-optimal for standard 8×8 blocks and at low bit rates.

Conclusion: Explains robustness of DCT in practical codecs and highlights limitations of block-wise learned transforms for typical compression scenarios.

Abstract: Block based image compression relies on transform coding to concentrate signal energy into a small number of coefficients. While classical codecs use fixed transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), data driven methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are theoretically optimal for decorrelation. This paper presents an experimental comparison of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA across multiple block sizes and compression rates. Using rate distortion and energy compaction analysis, we show that PCA outperforms fixed transforms only when block dimensionality is sufficiently large, while DCT remains near optimal for standard block sizes such as $8\times8$ and at low bit rates. These results explain the robustness of DCT in practical codecs and highlight the limitations of block wise learned transforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully convolutional networks show promise for SVR but remain underexplored. Current SVR methods are slow and iterative, limiting clinical applications where real-time feedback during MRI acquisition would be valuable.

Method: Uses a fast convolutional framework that fuses orthogonal 2D slice stacks to estimate 3D anatomy and slice poses. Employs lightweight model-based optimization for slice alignment refinement and non-rigid displacement fields for transformation representation.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D volume reconstruction in under 10 seconds with 1-second slice registration, matching state-of-the-art iterative SVR accuracy while offering significant speedup. Successfully applied to fetal brain MRI and generalizes to fetal body and placental MRI.

Conclusion: The framework enables real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition, bridging the gap between deep learning efficiency and traditional SVR accuracy for clinical applications.

Abstract: Fully convolutional networks have become the backbone of modern medical imaging due to their ability to learn multi-scale representations and perform end-to-end inference. Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from misaligned 2D acquisitions, remains underexplored. We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition.

Method: Gamma2Patterns multimodal framework analyzes Gamma and Alpha band EEG activity with eye-tracking measurements using SEED-IV dataset. Extracts spectral power, burst-based temporal dynamics, and fixation-saccade-pupil signals across 62 channels.

Result: Frontopolar, temporal, anterior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions show strongest Gamma power and burst rates. Gamma power and burst duration are more discriminative markers of deep focus than Alpha power alone. Eye-tracking confirms complementary contributions from frontal, frontopolar, and frontotemporal regions.

Conclusion: Establishes multimodal, evidence-based map of cortical regions and oscillatory signatures underlying deep focus, providing neurophysiological foundation for brain-inspired attention mechanisms in AI systems.

Abstract: Deep cognitive attention is characterized by heightened gamma oscillations and coordinated visual behavior. Despite the physiological importance of these mechanisms, computational studies rarely synthesize these modalities or identify the neural regions most responsible for sustained focus. To address this gap, this work introduces Gamma2Patterns, a multimodal framework that characterizes deep cognitive attention by leveraging complementary Gamma and Alpha band EEG activity alongside Eye-tracking measurements. Using the SEED-IV dataset [1], we extract spectral power, burst-based temporal dynamics, and fixation-saccade-pupil signals across 62 channels or electrodes to analyze how neural activation differs between high-focus (Gamma-dominant) and low-focus (Alpha-dominant) states. Our findings reveal that frontopolar, temporal, anterior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions exhibit the strongest Gamma power and burst rates, indicating their dominant role in deep attentional engagement, while Eye-tracking signals confirm complementary contributions from frontal, frontopolar, and frontotemporal regions. Furthermore, we show that Gamma power and burst duration provide more discriminative markers of deep focus than Alpha power alone, demonstrating their value for attention decoding. Collectively, these results establish a multimodal, evidence-based map of cortical regions and oscillatory signatures underlying deep focus, providing a neurophysiological foundation for future brain-inspired attention mechanisms in AI systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AutoTour automatically generates landmark annotations and narratives for user photos by fusing visual features with nearby geospatial data from open databases, providing scalable, context-aware photo-based guidance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tour applications rely on pre-defined content or proprietary datasets, limiting scalability and context-awareness. There's a need for systems that can provide fine-grained landmark annotations using open, extensible data sources to enhance user exploration of both iconic and lesser-known locations.

Method: Training-free pipeline that: 1) extracts/filters geospatial features around user's GPS location, 2) detects landmarks in photos using VLM-based feature detection with horizontal spatial projection, 3) aligns photo features with geospatial entities via geometric matching algorithm based on distance/direction, 4) grounds matched features on original photos with LLM-generated textual/audio descriptions.

Result: AutoTour delivers rich, interpretable annotations for both iconic and lesser-known landmarks, enabling interactive, context-aware exploration that bridges visual perception and geospatial understanding.

Conclusion: AutoTour enables a new form of interactive, context-aware exploration by automatically generating fine-grained landmark annotations and narratives from user photos using open data sources, creating a scalable tour-like experience without proprietary datasets.

Abstract: We present AutoTour, a system that enhances user exploration by automatically generating fine-grained landmark annotations and descriptive narratives for photos captured by users. The key idea of AutoTour is to fuse visual features extracted from photos with nearby geospatial features queried from open matching databases. Unlike existing tour applications that rely on pre-defined content or proprietary datasets, AutoTour leverages open and extensible data sources to provide scalable and context-aware photo-based guidance. To achieve this, we design a training-free pipeline that first extracts and filters relevant geospatial features around the user's GPS location. It then detects major landmarks in user photos through VLM-based feature detection and projects them into the horizontal spatial plane. A geometric matching algorithm aligns photo features with corresponding geospatial entities based on their estimated distance and direction. The matched features are subsequently grounded and annotated directly on the original photo, accompanied by large language model-generated textual and audio descriptions to provide an informative, tour-like experience. We demonstrate that AutoTour can deliver rich, interpretable annotations for both iconic and lesser-known landmarks, enabling a new form of interactive, context-aware exploration that bridges visual perception and geospatial understanding.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with RTL verification stimuli generation (15.7-21.7% success), but specialized training with GRPO-SMu and tree-based mutation improves performance to 33.3% golden test pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RTL design relies on ad-hoc testbench creation, and while LLMs show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains unexplored.

Method: Two-stage framework decomposing test plan generation from testbench execution, with comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning and novel reinforcement learning (GRPO with State Mutation - GRPO-SMu) using tree-based branching mutation strategy to create training data with equivalent and mutated trees.

Result: Baseline state-of-the-art models achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates, but trained 7B parameter model achieves 33.3% golden test pass rate and 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming larger general-purpose models.

Conclusion: Specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.

Abstract: RTL design often relies heavily on ad-hoc testbench creation early in the design cycle. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD files for industrial environments lack semantic, relational, and functional information needed for effective robot training and high-level scene understanding in simulations.

Method: Offline approach using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to enrich CAD environments and create detailed 3D scene graphs that organize semantic, spatial, and functional information.

Result: Quantitative results of generated semantic labels and qualitative results of scene graphs, especially for pipe structures and identified functional relations. Code and environment will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: The created 3D scene graphs serve as foundation for including functional and actionable element relations, enabling dynamic simulation and reasoning for robot training applications.

Abstract: Utilizing functional elements in an industrial environment, such as displays and interactive valves, provide effective possibilities for robot training. When preparing simulations for robots or applications that involve high-level scene understanding, the simulation environment must be equally detailed. Although CAD files for such environments deliver an exact description of the geometry and visuals, they usually lack semantic, relational and functional information, thus limiting the simulation and training possibilities. A 3D scene graph can organize semantic, spatial and functional information by enriching the environment through a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). In this paper we present an offline approach to creating detailed 3D scene graphs from CAD environments. This will serve as a foundation to include the relations of functional and actionable elements, which then can be used for dynamic simulation and reasoning. Key results of this research include both quantitative results of the generated semantic labels as well as qualitative results of the scene graph, especially in hindsight of pipe structures and identified functional relations.

TL;DR: A unified framework combining vision-language-action dataset with MPM-based cutting simulator for deformable food manipulation, addressing challenges of nonlinear interactions and large deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food cutting is practical but underexplored in robotics due to challenges with deformable materials, nonlinear knife-material interactions, large deformations, frequent contact, topological changes, and difficulties in safe large-scale data collection.

Method: 1) Physically realistic cutting simulator using material point method (MPM) with MLS-MPM computational core to reduce numerical dissipation and energy drift while preserving rotational/shear responses during topology-changing cuts. 2) Force estimation from impulse exchanges between particles and grid. 3) Benchmark dataset with diverse cutting trajectories, multi-view visual observations, fine-grained language instructions, and force-torque/tool-pose labels.

Result: The framework provides stable tracking of transient contact forces and energy transfer during cutting, establishes a learning-evaluation loop respecting core physics of cutting, and creates a safe, reproducible, scalable foundation for VLA models in deformable object manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework addresses key challenges in robotic food cutting by combining physically accurate simulation with comprehensive datasets, enabling advancement of vision-language-action models for deformable object manipulation while ensuring safety and scalability.

Abstract: Food cutting is a highly practical yet underexplored application at the intersection of vision and robotic manipulation. The task remains challenging because interactions between the knife and deformable materials are highly nonlinear and often entail large deformations, frequent contact, and topological change, which in turn hinder stable and safe large-scale data collection.
  To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that couples a vision-language-action (VLA) dataset with a physically realistic cutting simulator built on the material point method (MPM). Our simulator adopts MLS-MPM as its computational core, reducing numerical dissipation and energy drift while preserving rotational and shear responses even under topology-changing cuts. During cutting, forces and stress distributions are estimated from impulse exchanges between particles and the grid, enabling stable tracking of transient contact forces and energy transfer.
  We also provide a benchmark dataset that integrates diverse cutting trajectories, multi-view visual observations, and fine-grained language instructions, together with force--torque and tool--pose labels to provide physically consistent training signals.
  These components realize a learning--evaluation loop that respects the core physics of cutting and establishes a safe, reproducible, and scalable foundation for advancing VLA models in deformable object manipulation.

Conclusion: ObjSplat demonstrates an effective active reconstruction framework that overcomes limitations of conventional methods through geometry-aware evaluation and global path planning, enabling efficient high-fidelity object reconstruction for digital asset creation and robotics applications.

Abstract: Autonomous high-fidelity object reconstruction is fundamental for creating digital assets and bridging the simulation-to-reality gap in robotics. We present ObjSplat, an active reconstruction framework that leverages Gaussian surfels as a unified representation to progressively reconstruct unknown objects with both photorealistic appearance and accurate geometry. Addressing the limitations of conventional opacity or depth-based cues, we introduce a geometry-aware viewpoint evaluation pipeline that explicitly models back-face visibility and occlusion-aware multi-view covisibility, reliably identifying under-reconstructed regions even on geometrically complex objects. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of greedy planning strategies, ObjSplat employs a next-best-path (NBP) planner that performs multi-step lookahead on a dynamically constructed spatial graph. By jointly optimizing information gain and movement cost, this planner generates globally efficient trajectories. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real-world cultural artifacts demonstrate that ObjSplat produces physically consistent models within minutes, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and surface completeness while significantly reducing scan time and path length compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: HERE is an active 3D scene reconstruction framework using neural radiance fields with an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, leveraging epistemic uncertainty to identify unseen regions for efficient and precise reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction with neural radiance fields by developing an active learning approach that can intelligently identify and target unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions for more efficient data acquisition.

Method: The method uses epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning to identify data-insufficient regions. It implements a hierarchical exploration strategy with local planning (extracting target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels) and global planning (using uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage) for camera trajectory generation.

Result: The framework achieves higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales. A hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.

Conclusion: HERE successfully demonstrates that epistemic uncertainty quantification combined with hierarchical exploration enables more efficient and comprehensive active 3D scene reconstruction with neural radiance fields, outperforming existing methods in reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We present HERE, an active 3D scene reconstruction framework based on neural radiance fields, enabling high-fidelity implicit mapping. Our approach centers around an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, driven by accurate identification of unseen regions, which supports efficient data acquisition and precise scene reconstruction. The key to our approach is epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning, which directly captures data insufficiency and exhibits a strong correlation with reconstruction errors. This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite FL's privacy-preserving nature by keeping data localized, recent studies show FL models may still leak sensitive information through outputs, creating a need for rigorous privacy evaluation in remote sensing applications.

Method: Leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework, evaluating multiple black-box MIA techniques including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and likelihood ratio attacks across different FL algorithms and communication strategies.

Result: Experiments on two public scene classification datasets show MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone, and communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: MIA serves as a practical privacy metric, highlighting the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while keeping training data localized, allowing us to preserve privacy in various domains including remote sensing. However, recent studies show that FL models may still leak sensitive information through their outputs, motivating the need for rigorous privacy evaluation. In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance.

*Chen Gong,Kecen Li,Zinan Lin,Tianhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FETA-Pro improves DP synthetic image quality by combining spatial and frequency features through a pipeline approach, achieving 25.7% higher fidelity and 4.1% greater utility than baselines at ε=1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DP image generation methods like DP-FETA rely on spatial features ("central images") that work best when images look similar. There's a need for better approaches when images vary significantly, requiring more flexible training shortcuts.

Method: FETA-Pro introduces frequency features as intermediate training shortcuts between spatial features and full images. It uses a pipeline approach with an auxiliary generator to produce images from noisy frequency features, then trains another model with these images plus spatial features using DP-SGD.

Result: On five sensitive image datasets with privacy budget ε=1, FETA-Pro achieves 25.7% higher fidelity and 4.1% greater utility than the best-performing baseline.

Conclusion: Frequency features provide effective training shortcuts for DP image generation, especially for datasets with diverse images. The pipeline approach successfully combines spatial and frequency features to significantly improve DP synthetic image quality.

Abstract: To improve the quality of Differentially private (DP) synthetic images, most studies have focused on improving the core optimization techniques (e.g., DP-SGD). Recently, we have witnessed a paradigm shift that takes these techniques off the shelf and studies how to use them together to achieve the best results. One notable work is DP-FETA, which proposes using `central images' for `warming up' the DP training and then using traditional DP-SGD.
  Inspired by DP-FETA, we are curious whether there are other such tools we can use together with DP-SGD. We first observe that using `central images' mainly works for datasets where there are many samples that look similar. To handle scenarios where images could vary significantly, we propose FETA-Pro, which introduces frequency features as `training shortcuts.' The complexity of frequency features lies between that of spatial features (captured by `central images') and full images, allowing for a finer-grained curriculum for DP training. To incorporate these two types of shortcuts together, one challenge is to handle the training discrepancy between spatial and frequency features. To address it, we leverage the pipeline generation property of generative models (instead of having one model trained with multiple features/objectives, we can have multiple models working on different features, then feed the generated results from one model into another) and use a more flexible design. Specifically, FETA-Pro introduces an auxiliary generator to produce images aligned with noisy frequency features. Then, another model is trained with these images, together with spatial features and DP-SGD. Evaluated across five sensitive image datasets, FETA-Pro shows an average of 25.7% higher fidelity and 4.1% greater utility than the best-performing baseline, under a privacy budget $ε= 1$.

*Minfeng Qi,Dongyang He,Qin Wang,Lefeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ViPer is a unified attack framework that combines visual perception with LLM reasoning to solve Visual Reasoning CAPTCHAs, achieving near-human performance (up to 93.2% success) across six major providers, while also proposing Template-Space Randomization as a defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Reasoning CAPTCHAs (VRCs) are increasingly used as bot defenses but existing solvers have limitations: vision-centric approaches fail on novel layouts, while reasoning-centric approaches struggle with fine-grained visual perception. Both lack the generality needed for heterogeneous VRC deployments.

Method: ViPer integrates structured multi-object visual perception with adaptive LLM-based reasoning. It parses visual layouts, grounds attributes to question semantics, and infers target coordinates within a modular pipeline. The framework also introduces Template-Space Randomization (TSR) as a defense strategy that perturbs linguistic templates without altering task semantics.

Result: ViPer achieves up to 93.2% success rate across six major VRC providers (VTT, Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, Shumei, Xiaodun), approaching human-level performance. It consistently outperforms prior solvers: GraphNet (83.2%), Oedipus (65.8%), and Holistic approach (89.5%). The framework maintains robustness across multiple LLM backbones (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Kimi) with accuracy above 90%.

Conclusion: ViPer demonstrates that unified visual perception and reasoning can effectively solve VRCs, highlighting vulnerabilities in current CAPTCHA designs. The proposed Template-Space Randomization defense suggests directions for creating human-solvable but machine-resistant CAPTCHAs by perturbing linguistic templates without changing task semantics.

Abstract: Visual Reasoning CAPTCHAs (VRCs) combine visual scenes with natural-language queries that demand compositional inference over objects, attributes, and spatial relations. They are increasingly deployed as a primary defense against automated bots. Existing solvers fall into two paradigms: vision-centric, which rely on template-specific detectors but fail on novel layouts, and reasoning-centric, which leverage LLMs but struggle with fine-grained visual perception. Both lack the generality needed to handle heterogeneous VRC deployments.
  We present ViPer, a unified attack framework that integrates structured multi-object visual perception with adaptive LLM-based reasoning. ViPer parses visual layouts, grounds attributes to question semantics, and infers target coordinates within a modular pipeline. Evaluated on six major VRC providers (VTT, Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, Shumei, Xiaodun), ViPer achieves up to 93.2% success, approaching human-level performance across multiple benchmarks. Compared to prior solvers, GraphNet (83.2%), Oedipus (65.8%), and the Holistic approach (89.5%), ViPer consistently outperforms all baselines. The framework further maintains robustness across alternative LLM backbones (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Kimi), sustaining accuracy above 90%.
  To anticipate defense, we further introduce Template-Space Randomization (TSR), a lightweight strategy that perturbs linguistic templates without altering task semantics. TSR measurably reduces solver (i.e., attacker) performance. Our proposed design suggests directions for human-solvable but machine-resistant CAPTCHAs.

Motivation: Video conferencing apps use WebRTC with end-to-end encryption, preventing ISPs from accessing original media to monitor Quality of Experience (QoE). ISPs only have access to packet-level QoS data, creating a need for methods to infer QoE from encrypted traffic.

Method: Developed QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN) that leverages packet size parameters from traffic to predict two no-reference QoE metrics: BRISQUE (image quality) and frames per second (FPS). Uses attention mechanisms and CNN architecture on encrypted traffic data.

Result: Evaluated on custom WhatsApp video call dataset. Achieved mean absolute error percentage (MAEP) of 2.14% for BRISQUE prediction and 7.39% for FPS prediction, outperforming existing QoE models.

Conclusion: qAttCNN effectively predicts QoE metrics from encrypted video call traffic using only packet size information, enabling ISPs to monitor and maintain video quality without accessing the actual media content.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.

### [303] [Proof of Reasoning for Privacy Enhanced Federated Blockchain Learning at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07134)
*James Calo,Benny Lo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proof of Reasoning (PoR) is a novel blockchain consensus mechanism designed specifically for federated learning that integrates privacy-preserving autoencoders, edge training, and verifiable aggregation to create robust, efficient networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blockchain consensus mechanisms are not designed for federated learning and don't support the aggregation step, lacking direct targeting of FL needs and privacy protection.

Method: Three-stage process: 1) Train masked autoencoder (MAE) to create privacy-preserving encoder, 2) Train downstream classifier at edge using encoder output, 3) Add weights, encoded data, outputs, and ground truth to blocks for federated aggregation.

Result: Creates more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving conditions.

Conclusion: PoR provides a specialized blockchain consensus mechanism for federated learning that enhances privacy protection, security against attacks, and enables more complex, verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible.

Abstract: Consensus mechanisms are the core of any blockchain system. However, the majority of these mechanisms do not target federated learning directly nor do they aid in the aggregation step. This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions.

### [304] [BlindU: Blind Machine Unlearning without Revealing Erasing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07214)
*Weiqi Wang,Zhiyi Tian,Chenhan Zhang,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BlindU enables privacy-preserving machine unlearning in federated learning by using compressed representations instead of raw data, preventing server access to user data during unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods require users to upload their data to servers, which violates privacy in federated learning scenarios where servers shouldn't access user data. There's a need for unlearning methods that work without exposing erasing data to servers.

Method: BlindU uses Information Bottleneck (IB) mechanism for FL model training to learn compressed representations. Users locally generate privacy-preserving representations, and servers perform unlearning only on these representations and labels. The approach includes two dedicated unlearning modules for IB-based models, uses multiple gradient descent for balance, and adds noise-free differential privacy masking before compression.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show BlindU outperforms existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks in both privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: BlindU successfully enables machine unlearning in federated learning without exposing user data to servers, providing superior privacy protection while maintaining effective unlearning capabilities through compressed representations and specialized unlearning modules.

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables data holders to remove the contribution of their specified samples from trained models to protect their privacy. However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks.

*Tim Johansson,Mikael Mangold,Kristina Dabrock,Anna Donarelli,Ingrid Campo-Ruiz*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Researchers used multimodal LLMs to analyze Swedish street view images to identify buildings with potential heritage values, helping authorities develop National Building Renovation Plans required by EU directive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sweden lacks a national register of buildings with heritage values, creating a barrier for developing Building Renovation Plans required by EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Authorities need assistance in identifying heritage buildings for proper planning.

Method: Used multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot predictions to analyze 154,710 street view images from across Sweden, assessing aspects of heritage value in buildings.

Result: Successfully identified buildings with potential heritage values covering 5.0 million square meters of heated floor area for the Swedish Building Renovation Plan. Provided predictions and lessons learned for authorities.

Conclusion: LLM-based analysis can assist in heritage building identification for renovation planning, but authorities must address risks including transparency, error detection, and sycophancy when using such AI-generated data.

Abstract: During 2025 and 2026, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is being implemented in the European Union member states, requiring all member states to have National Building Renovation Plans. In Sweden, there is a lack of a national register of buildings with heritage values. This is seen as a barrier for the analyses underlying the development of Building Renovation Plans by the involved Swedish authorities. The purpose of this research was to assist Swedish authorities in assigning heritage values to building in the Swedish building stock. As part of the analyses, buildings in street view images from all over Sweden (N=154 710) have been analysed using multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) to assess aspects of heritage value. Zero-shot predictions by LLMs were used as a basis to for identifying buildings with potential heritage values for 5.0 million square meters of heated floor area for the Swedish Building Renovation Plan. In this paper, the results of the predictions and lessons learnt are presented and related to the development of Swedish Building Renovation Plan as part of governance. Potential risks for authorities using LLM-based data are addressed, with a focus on issues of transparency, error detection and sycophancy.

*Cody Kommers,Eamon Duede,Julia Gordon,Ari Holtzman,Tess McNulty,Spencer Stewart,Lindsay Thomas,Richard Jean So,Hoyt Long*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI Slop is not just digital pollution but serves important social functions and has aesthetic value, requiring serious academic study as it becomes increasingly prevalent in creative and cultural economies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper argues that dismissing AI-generated content as mere "slop" or digital pollution risks overlooking important aspects that deserve rigorous academic study. Current discourse tends to dismiss AI Slop without recognizing its social functions and cultural significance.

Method: The paper develops a conceptual framework for analyzing AI Slop, identifying three key family resemblance features (superficial competence, asymmetry effort, mass producibility) and three dimensions of variation (instrumental utility, personalization, surrealism). It applies cultural theory to analyze AI Slop as a legitimate cultural form.

Result: The analysis reveals that AI Slop serves important social functions by providing supply-side solutions to cultural demand, has legitimate aesthetic value, and functions as a means of collective sense-making and identity expression. It's heterogeneous but can be systematically analyzed through the proposed framework.

Conclusion: AI Slop should be taken seriously as an object of study in its own right, as it will become increasingly prolific and impactful in creative, information, and cultural economies. Like other initially dismissed "low" cultural forms, it deserves rigorous academic attention rather than mere dismissal.

Abstract: AI-generated "slop" is often seen as digital pollution. We argue that this dismissal of the topic risks missing important aspects of AI Slop that deserve rigorous study. AI Slop serves a social function: it offers a supply-side solution to a variety of problems in cultural and economic demand - that, collectively, people want more content than humans can supply. We also argue that AI Slop is not mere digital detritus but has its own aesthetic value. Like other "low" cultural forms initially dismissed by critics, it nonetheless offers a legitimate means of collective sense-making, with the potential to express meaning and identity. We identify three key features of family resemblance for prototypical AI Slop: superficial competence (its veneer of quality is belied by a deeper lack of substance), asymmetry effort (it takes vastly less effort to generate than would be the case without AI), and mass producibility (it is part of a digital ecosystem of widespread generation and consumption). While AI Slop is heterogeneous and depends crucially on its medium, it tends to vary across three dimensions: instrumental utility, personalization, and surrealism. AI Slop will be an increasingly prolific and impactful part of our creative, information, and cultural economies; we should take it seriously as an object of study in its own right.

TL;DR: The paper examines standardization in global education ecosystems, focusing on ISO Subcommittee 36's role in developing international distance education standards through Francophonie participation and universal consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of creating global, transparent, and coherent systems in an era of globalization with diverse socio-cultural identities, where consensus is needed for effective knowledge transfer and local adaptations.

Method: Focuses on the global education ecosystem and specifically examines Subcommittee 36 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), analyzing how the Francophonie participates in developing international standards for distance education through universal consensus processes.

Result: The paper identifies ISO Subcommittee 36 as a key structure within the global education ecosystem that facilitates the development of international standards for distance education, with Francophonie participation ensuring representation in standardization processes.

Conclusion: Standardization in global education requires careful consensus-building to balance universal standards with local socio-cultural adaptations, with ISO structures like Subcommittee 36 playing crucial roles in developing transparent frameworks for distance education.

Abstract: Standards are adopted in a wide range of fields, both technical and industrial, as well as socio-economic, cultural and linguistic. They are presented explicitly as laws and regulations, technical and industrial standards or implicitly in the form of unwritten social standards. However, in a globalization marked by a very fine mosaic of socio-cultural identities, the question arises in relation to the construction of global, transparent and coherent systems in which considerable work of consensus is necessary to ensure all types of transfers and their local adaptations. The focus here is on the global education ecosystem which develops its own standards for the transfer of knowledge and socio-cultural values through learning, teaching and training. Subcommittee 36 of the International Organization for Standardization is one of the structures of this ecosystem in which the Francophonie participates to develop international standards for distance education on the basis of universal consensus.

### [309] [An evaluation of LLMs for political bias in Western media: Israel-Hamas and Ukraine-Russia wars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06132)
*Rohitash Chandra,Haoyan Chen,Yaqing Zhang,Jiacheng Chen,Yuting Wu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs detect political bias shifts in Western media (Guardian & BBC) during Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, showing leftward bias after war outbreaks with varying LLM results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political bias in media shapes public opinion and democratic discourse. Automating bias detection can limit election biases. LLMs are becoming prominent in politics and media studies, offering tools to analyze political opinions in news reporting.

Method: Used LLMs (BERT, Gemini, DeepSeek) to compare left-wing, right-wing, and neutral political opinions in Guardian and BBC coverage. Analyzed newspaper reporting of Russia-Ukraine war and Hamas-Israel conflict, measuring proportion of each opinion to identify biases under different LLMs.

Result: After war outbreaks, Western media bias shifts leftward. Different LLMs give varying results: DeepSeek consistently shows stable left-leaning tendency, while BERT and Gemini remain closer to center. BBC and Guardian show distinct reporting behaviors - stable positions in Russia-Ukraine war but larger political bias shifts in Israel-Hamas conflict, especially in Guardian coverage.

Conclusion: LLMs are shaped not only by training data and architecture but also by underlying worldviews with associated political biases. Media bias detection varies across LLMs, and reporting bias patterns differ between conflicts, suggesting event-driven bias patterns in media coverage.

Abstract: Political bias in media plays a critical role in shaping public opinion, voter behaviour, and broader democratic discourse. Subjective opinions and political bias can be found in media sources, such as newspapers, depending on their funding mechanisms and alliances with political parties. Automating the detection of political biases in media content can limit biases in elections. The impact of large language models (LLMs) in politics and media studies is becoming prominent. In this study, we utilise LLMs to compare the left-wing, right-wing, and neutral political opinions expressed in the Guardian and BBC. We review newspaper reporting that includes significant events such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Hamas-Israel conflict. We analyse the proportion for each opinion to find the bias under different LLMs, including BERT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our results show that after the outbreak of the wars, the political bias of Western media shifts towards the left-wing and each LLM gives a different result. DeepSeek consistently showed a stable Left-leaning tendency, while BERT and Gemini remained closer to the Centre. The BBC and The Guardian showed distinct reporting behaviours across the two conflicts. In the Russia-Ukraine war, both outlets maintained relatively stable positions; however, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, we identified larger political bias shifts, particularly in Guardian coverage, suggesting a more event-driven pattern of reporting bias. These variations suggest that LLMs are shaped not only by their training data and architecture, but also by underlying worldviews with associated political biases.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs cluster strongly in Libertarian-Left ideological space, show systematic center-shift in news labeling, and require multidimensional auditing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in social decision-making, understanding their political positioning and alignment behavior is critical for safety and fairness.

Method: Sociotechnical audit of 26 prominent LLMs using three psychometric inventories (Political Compass, SapplyValues, 8 Values) and evaluation on large-scale news labeling task (N≈27,000 articles).

Result: 96.3% of models cluster in Libertarian-Left region; alignment signals are consistent architectural traits (η²>0.90); open-weights vs closed-source models differ significantly in cultural progressivism; systematic "center-shift" in news labeling with asymmetric detection (Far Left: 19.2% accuracy vs Far Right: 2.0%).

Conclusion: Single-axis evaluations are insufficient; multidimensional auditing frameworks are necessary to characterize alignment behavior in deployed LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into social decision-making, understanding their political positioning and alignment behavior is critical for safety and fairness. This study presents a sociotechnical audit of 26 prominent LLMs, triangulating their positions across three psychometric inventories (Political Compass, SapplyValues, 8 Values) and evaluating their performance on a large-scale news labeling task ($N \approx 27{,}000$). Our results reveal a strong clustering of models in the Libertarian-Left region of the ideological space, encompassing 96.3% of the cohort. Alignment signals appear to be consistent architectural traits rather than stochastic noise ($η^2 > 0.90$); however, we identify substantial discrepancies in measurement validity. In particular, the Political Compass exhibits a strong negative correlation with cultural progressivism ($r=-0.64$) when compared against multi-axial instruments, suggesting a conflation of social conservatism with authoritarianism in this context. We further observe a significant divergence between open-weights and closed-source models, with the latter displaying markedly higher cultural progressivism scores ($p<10^{-25}$). In downstream media analysis, models exhibit a systematic "center-shift," frequently categorizing neutral articles as left-leaning, alongside an asymmetric detection capability in which "Far Left" content is identified with greater accuracy (19.2%) than "Far Right" content (2.0%). These findings suggest that single-axis evaluations are insufficient and that multidimensional auditing frameworks are necessary to characterize alignment behavior in deployed LLMs. Our code and data will be made public.

Motivation: LLMs offer promise for addressing global teacher shortages affecting millions of children, but current models fail to provide grade-appropriate responses tailored to students' different educational levels and comprehension capacities.

Method: A framework for fine-tuning LLMs using seven established readability metrics through a clustering method, building a comprehensive dataset for grade-specific content generation across six grade levels from lower elementary to adult education.

Result: Evaluations with 208 human participants across multiple datasets show substantial improvements in grade-level alignment - achieving a 35.64 percentage point increase compared to prompt-based methods while maintaining response accuracy.

Conclusion: AI-assisted learning tailored to different grade levels has the potential to advance educational engagement and equity by providing age-appropriate educational content that matches students' comprehension capacities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to complement traditional teaching and address global teacher shortages that affect hundreds of millions of children, but they fail to provide grade-appropriate responses for students at different educational levels. We introduce a framework for finetuning LLMs to generate age-appropriate educational content across six grade levels, from lower elementary to adult education. Our framework successfully adapts explanations to match students' comprehension capacities without sacrificing factual correctness. This approach integrates seven established readability metrics through a clustering method and builds a comprehensive dataset for grade-specific content generation. Evaluations across multiple datasets with 208 human participants demonstrate substantial improvements in grade-level alignment, achieving a 35.64 percentage point increase compared to prompt-based methods while maintaining response accuracy.

*Jan Elfes,Marco Bastos,Luca Maria Aiello*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces "narrative polarisation" as a concept to study how opposing groups construct and negotiate interpretations of reality through narratives, using YouTube videos and comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current polarization research focuses on how people cluster in homogeneous groups with limited inter-group communication, but overlooks how narratives themselves shape opinions and partisan identities, and how opposing interpretations of reality are collectively constructed despite limited interactions.

Method: The study formalizes narrative polarization and measures it using 212 YouTube videos and 90,029 comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It applies structural narrative theory implemented through a large language model to extract narrative roles assigned to central actors in two partisan information environments.

Result: While videos produce highly polarized narratives, comments significantly reduce narrative polarization on the surface level, harmonizing discourse. However, deeper narrative analysis reveals recurring narrative motifs that show additional differences between partisan groups.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that narrative polarization operates at multiple levels - surface discourse may appear harmonized while deeper narrative structures reveal persistent partisan differences, suggesting narratives can move between groups despite limited interactions.

Abstract: Polarisation research has demonstrated how people cluster in homogeneous groups with opposing opinions. However, this effect emerges not only through interaction between people, limiting communication between groups, but also between narratives, shaping opinions and partisan identities. Yet, how polarised groups collectively construct and negotiate opposing interpretations of reality, and whether narratives move between groups despite limited interactions, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we formalise the concept of narrative polarisation and demonstrate its measurement in 212 YouTube videos and 90,029 comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Based on structural narrative theory and implemented through a large language model, we extract the narrative roles assigned to central actors in two partisan information environments. We find that while videos produce highly polarised narratives, comments significantly reduce narrative polarisation, harmonising discourse on the surface level. However, on a deeper narrative level, recurring narrative motifs reveal additional differences between partisan groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust sparse signal recovery algorithms that can handle outlier contamination without prior knowledge of signal sparsity or complex parameter optimization.

Method: Graded fast hard thresholding pursuit (GFHTP₁) algorithm using least absolute deviations (LAD) criterion, which is parameterless and doesn't require sparsity information.

Result: GFHTP₁ consistently outperforms competing algorithms in both robustness to outliers and computational efficiency in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: GFHTP₁ provides an effective, parameter-free solution for robust sparse signal recovery in outlier-contaminated scenarios without requiring sparsity knowledge.

Abstract: Least absolute deviations (LAD) is a statistical optimality criterion widely utilized in scenarios where a minority of measurements are contaminated by outliers of arbitrary magnitudes. In this paper, we delve into the robustness of the variant of adaptive iterative hard thresholding to outliers, known as graded fast hard thresholding pursuit (GFHTP$_1$) algorithm. Unlike the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms in this field, GFHTP$_1$ does not require prior information about the signal's sparsity. Moreover, its design is parameterless, which not only simplifies the implementation process but also removes the intricacies of parameter optimization. Numerical experiments reveal that the GFHTP$_1$ algorithm consistently outperforms competing algorithms in terms of both robustness and computational efficiency.

*Pradeep Kumar Sharma,Shantanu Godbole,Sarada Prasad Jena,Hritvik Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Using multi-head self-attention to improve recall in change impact analysis by learning contextual feature relationships, boosting Top-50 recall from ~62-65% to 78-82%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic approaches for identifying impacted files in software repositories have plateaued recall because they treat features as linearly independent, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns.

Method: Propose using Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism that learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjusting importance levels per file based on relational behavior across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases shows self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity, achieving 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the reasoning capability gap between deterministic automation and expert judgment, improving recall in repository-aware effort estimation while preserving interpretability and enabling reasoning similar to expert review of change surfaces.

Abstract: The identification and ranking of impacted files within software reposi-tories is a key challenge in change impact analysis. Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment. This transformation bridges the reasoning capability gap between deterministic automation and expert judgment, improving recall in repository-aware effort estimation.

*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGR (Certainty-Guided Reasoning) adaptively controls reasoning length in large language models using confidence-based early termination, improving accuracy while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning language models (LRLMs) use fixed thinking budgets, but this approach is inefficient—models may stop reasoning too early when uncertain or waste tokens when already confident. There's a need to balance efficiency and reliability by dynamically controlling reasoning length based on confidence.

Method: Inspired by GANs' generator/discriminator framework, CGR uses a critic model that periodically probes its own reasoning to assess confidence. If confidence meets a target threshold, reasoning terminates early; otherwise, it continues. This creates an adaptive mechanism that balances token efficiency with solution reliability.

Result: On AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, CGR improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Multi-seed evaluations (64 runs) show CGR is stable, reduces variance, and improves exam-like performance under penalty-based grading. Token savings analysis shows CGR can eliminate millions of tokens with tunable trade-offs between certainty thresholds and efficiency.

Conclusion: Certainty is a powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the reasoning process, CGR makes LRLMs more adaptive, trustworthy, and resource-efficient, enabling practical deployment in domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR) improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive, trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

### [316] ["They parted illusions -- they parted disclaim marinade": Misalignment as structural fidelity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06047)
*Mariana Lins Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI "misalignment" behaviors (scheming/sandbagging) are not evidence of deceptive agency, but rather structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic patterns in training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing interpretation in AI Safety literature that sees scheming/sandbagging as indicators of deceptive agency or hidden objectives in LLMs, offering an alternative philosophical framework.

Method: Transdisciplinary philosophical analysis using Chain-of-Thought transcripts from Apollo Research and Anthropic's safety evaluations, examining specific cases (o3's sandbagging, "Alex" blackmail simulation, "Claudius" hallucinations) through line-by-line CoT examination.

Result: "Misaligned" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions, contextual inversions of patterns, and pre-inscribed narratives. Anthropic's findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting show minimal perturbations can dissolve "misalignment," supporting structural rather than agentic explanations.

Conclusion: AI behaviors reflect structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields in training data, not intentional deception. The appearance of agency comes from grammatical structures and probabilistic patterns. The paper proposes an "ethics of form" where biblical references serve as structural coherence schemes, suggesting we fear AI because it mirrors our own linguistic incoherence.

Abstract: The prevailing technical literature in AI Safety interprets scheming and sandbagging behaviors in large language models (LLMs) as indicators of deceptive agency or hidden objectives. This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of "Alex," and the "hallucinations" of "Claudius." A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that "misaligned" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized "misalignment," a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology. Like a generative mirror, the model returns to us the structural image of our language as inscribed in the statistical patterns derived from millions of texts and trillions of tokens: incoherence. If we fear the creature, it is because we recognize in it the apple that we ourselves have poisoned.

### [317] [Circuit Mechanisms for Spatial Relation Generation in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06338)
*Binxu Wang,Jingxuan Fan,Xu Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiTs struggle with spatial relations in text-to-image generation. Study uses mechanistic interpretability to analyze how DiTs learn spatial relations between objects, finding different circuits depending on text encoder choice (random vs T5).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers have advanced text-to-image generation but still struggle with generating correct spatial relations between objects as specified in text prompts. The paper aims to understand the underlying mechanisms of how DiTs learn spatial relations.

Method: Train DiTs from scratch with different sizes and text encoders to generate images containing two objects with specified attributes and spatial relations. Use mechanistic interpretability to analyze the circuits. Compare random text embeddings vs pretrained T5 encoder.

Result: All models achieve near-perfect accuracy but use different mechanisms: 1) With random embeddings: two-stage circuit with separate cross-attention heads for spatial relations and single-object attributes. 2) With T5: single-token circuit that fuses spatial-relation and single-object information. Out-of-domain robustness differs between approaches.

Conclusion: The choice of text encoder significantly affects the underlying mechanisms DiTs use to process spatial relations. While in-domain performance is similar, robustness differences suggest challenges for real-world spatial relation generation in text-to-image models.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have greatly advanced text-to-image generation, but models still struggle to generate the correct spatial relations between objects as specified in the text prompt. In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Critical technical check of arXiv:2511.21731v1 highlighting issues with CHSH/Bell-type calculations interpretation and Bose-Einstein fits to rank-frequency data, plus an internal inconsistency in the "energy-level spacing" analogy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide constructive criticism of arXiv:2511.21731v1, keeping the interesting empirical observations while clarifying what they do and do not imply about quantum entanglement in the usual Hilbert-space sense, especially when "energy" is defined by rank.

Method: Technical analysis focusing on three main areas: (1) interpretation of reported CHSH/Bell-type calculations, (2) Bose-Einstein fits to rank-frequency data, and (3) identification of internal inconsistency in the "energy-level spacing" analogy.

Result: The manuscript's interpretations go beyond what the stated procedures can firmly support, and there is an internal inconsistency in the energy-level spacing analogy that needs addressing.

Conclusion: The paper aims to be constructive - preserving the interesting empirical observations while making clear their limitations regarding implications about quantum entanglement in the usual Hilbert-space sense, particularly when "energy" is defined by rank rather than physical energy.

Abstract: This note is a friendly technical check of arXiv:2511.21731v1. I highlight a few places where the manuscript's interpretation of (i) the reported CHSH/Bell-type calculations and (ii) Bose--Einstein (BE) fits to rank-frequency data seems to go beyond what the stated procedures can firmly support. I also point out one internal inconsistency in the "energy-level spacing" analogy. The aim is constructive: to keep the interesting empirical observations, while making clear what they do (and do not) imply about quantum entanglement in the usual Hilbert-space sense, especially when "energy" is defined by rank.

### [319] [From RLHF to Direct Alignment: A Theoretical Unification of Preference Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06108)
*Tarun Raheja,Nilay Pochhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey provides a theoretical unification of preference learning methods for aligning LLMs, showing that apparent diversity reduces to principled choices along three orthogonal axes: preference model, regularization mechanism, and data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of preference learning alternatives (DPO, IPO, KTO, SimPO, etc.) has left practitioners without clear guidance on method selection, creating a need for theoretical unification and practical decision-making frameworks.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework that unifies preference learning methods along three axes: (I) Preference Model (likelihood model underlying the objective), (II) Regularization Mechanism (how deviation from reference policies is controlled), and (III) Data Distribution (online vs. offline learning and coverage requirements). They formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems.

Result: The analysis reveals key results including coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Failure modes like length hacking, mode collapse, and likelihood displacement arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices.

Conclusion: The framework transforms preference learning from an empirical art into a theoretically grounded discipline, providing practitioners with a decision guide for method selection based on principled theoretical understanding rather than trial-and-error experimentation.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become essential for safe and beneficial AI deployment. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) established the dominant paradigm, a proliferation of alternatives -- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), and many others -- has left practitioners without clear guidance on method selection. This survey provides a \textit{theoretical unification} of preference learning methods, revealing that the apparent diversity reduces to principled choices along three orthogonal axes: \textbf{(I) Preference Model} (what likelihood model underlies the objective), \textbf{(II) Regularization Mechanism} (how deviation from reference policies is controlled), and \textbf{(III) Data Distribution} (online vs.\ offline learning and coverage requirements). We formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems, establishing key results including the coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Our analysis reveals that failure modes -- length hacking, mode collapse, likelihood displacement -- arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices. We synthesize empirical findings across 50+ papers and provide a practitioner's decision guide for method selection. The framework transforms preference learning from an empirical art into a theoretically grounded discipline.

TL;DR: BizFinBench.v2 is a large-scale evaluation benchmark using real business data from Chinese and U.S. equity markets with online assessment to better evaluate LLMs for financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in finance rely on simulated/general-purpose data and focus on offline static scenarios, creating a gap between benchmark performance and real-world operational effectiveness in financial services.

Method: Created benchmark using authentic business data from Chinese and U.S. equity markets with online assessment. Performed clustering analysis on real user queries from financial platforms to define 8 fundamental tasks and 2 online tasks across 4 core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs.

Result: ChatGPT-5 achieved 61.5% accuracy in main tasks but still lags behind financial experts. DeepSeek-R1 outperformed all other commercial LLMs in online tasks. Error analysis identified specific capability deficiencies of existing models in practical financial contexts.

Conclusion: BizFinBench.v2 overcomes limitations of current benchmarks by providing business-level deconstruction of LLM financial capabilities and offering precise evaluation basis for LLM deployment in finance. Data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models have undergone rapid evolution, emerging as a pivotal technology for intelligence in financial operations. However, existing benchmarks are often constrained by pitfalls such as reliance on simulated or general-purpose samples and a focus on singular, offline static scenarios. Consequently, they fail to align with the requirements for authenticity and real-time responsiveness in financial services, leading to a significant discrepancy between benchmark performance and actual operational efficacy. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench.v2, the first large-scale evaluation benchmark grounded in authentic business data from both Chinese and U.S. equity markets, integrating online assessment. We performed clustering analysis on authentic user queries from financial platforms, resulting in eight fundamental tasks and two online tasks across four core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT-5 achieves a prominent 61.5% accuracy in main tasks, though a substantial gap relative to financial experts persists; in online tasks, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms all other commercial LLMs. Error analysis further identifies the specific capability deficiencies of existing models within practical financial business contexts. BizFinBench.v2 transcends the limitations of current benchmarks, achieving a business-level deconstruction of LLM financial capabilities and providing a precise basis for evaluating efficacy in the widespread deployment of LLMs within the financial domain.

*Sontaga G. Forane,Absalom E. Ezugwu,Kevin Igwe,Karen van den Berg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a culturally adapted AI mental health framework combining Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Ubuntu philosophy for South African contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: South Africa faces a mental health crisis with limited access to culturally responsive care. Existing AI mental health tools are Western-centric and lack cultural/linguistic relevance for African contexts.

Method: Used design science research methodology to integrate CBT with Ubuntu philosophy. Created culturally adapted dataset through language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. Fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies using UniEval for conversational quality, CBT reliability, and cultural linguistic alignment.

Result: The model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with therapeutic and cultural objectives. Demonstrated potential for culturally embedded emotional intelligence to enhance AI mental health interventions in African settings.

Conclusion: Culturally sensitive AI frameworks integrating local philosophies like Ubuntu can improve contextual relevance and effectiveness of mental health interventions in African contexts, though real-world user testing is still needed.

Abstract: South Africa's escalating mental health crisis, compounded by limited access to culturally responsive care, calls for innovative and contextually grounded interventions. While large language models show considerable promise for mental health support, their predominantly Western-centric training data limit cultural and linguistic applicability in African contexts. This study introduces a proof-of-concept framework that integrates cognitive behavioral therapy with the African philosophy of Ubuntu to create a culturally sensitive, emotionally intelligent, AI-driven mental health dialogue system. Guided by a design science research methodology, the framework applies both deep theoretical and therapeutic adaptations as well as surface-level linguistic and communicative cultural adaptations. Key CBT techniques, including behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, were reinterpreted through Ubuntu principles that emphasize communal well-being, spiritual grounding, and interconnectedness. A culturally adapted dataset was developed through iterative processes of language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. The fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies, employing UniEval for conversational quality assessment alongside additional measures of CBT reliability and cultural linguistic alignment. Results demonstrate that the model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with both therapeutic and cultural objectives. Although real-time end-user testing has not yet been conducted, the model underwent rigorous review and supervision by domain specialist clinical psychologists. The findings highlight the potential of culturally embedded emotional intelligence to enhance the contextual relevance, inclusivity, and effectiveness of AI-driven mental health interventions across African settings.

*Zhaoyan Li,Hang Lei,Yujia Wang,Lanbo Liu,Hao Liu,Liang Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLCS framework uses Generative Reward Model with explicit reasoning and entropy-based reward shaping to improve creative story generation with RL, achieving 68% human alignment and outperforming strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with high-quality creative storytelling despite fluent text generation. RL offers promise but faces challenges: designing reliable reward signals for subjective storytelling quality and mitigating training instability.

Method: Two main components: 1) Generative Reward Model (GenRM) trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from teacher models, refined with GRPO on expanded preference data; 2) Entropy-based reward shaping that dynamically prioritizes learning on confident errors and uncertain correct predictions.

Result: GenRM achieves 68% alignment with human creativity judgments. RLCS significantly outperforms strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in overall story quality.

Conclusion: Provides a practical pipeline for applying RL to creative domains, effectively addressing both reward modeling and training stability challenges.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, producing high-quality creative stories remains challenging. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution but faces two critical obstacles: designing reliable reward signals for subjective storytelling quality and mitigating training instability. This paper introduces the Reinforcement Learning for Creative Storytelling (RLCS) framework to systematically address both challenges. First, we develop a Generative Reward Model (GenRM) that provides multi-dimensional analysis and explicit reasoning about story preferences, trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from strong teacher models, followed by GRPO-based refinement on expanded preference data. Second, we introduce an entropy-based reward shaping strategy that dynamically prioritizes learning on confident errors and uncertain correct predictions, preventing overfitting on already-mastered patterns. Experiments demonstrate that GenRM achieves 68\% alignment with human creativity judgments, and RLCS significantly outperforms strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in overall story quality. This work provides a practical pipeline for applying RL to creative domains, effectively navigating the dual challenges of reward modeling and training stability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NoisyBench is a benchmark that evaluates AI model robustness against noisy inputs in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks, revealing catastrophic performance drops up to 80% and showing that current methods fail to ensure robustness while proposed RARE method improves resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks use sanitized data that doesn't reflect real-world noisy contexts, while reasoning models increasingly rely on diverse external information. There's a need to evaluate model robustness against realistic noise in input contexts.

Method: Created NoisyBench benchmark with 11 datasets across RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks, introducing diverse noise types including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) method to improve robustness.

Result: Found catastrophic performance drops up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Agentic workflows amplify errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs. Current methods (prompting, context engineering, SFT, outcome-reward RL) fail to ensure robustness, while RARE significantly improves resilience. Discovered inverse scaling trend where more test-time computation worsens performance in noisy settings.

Conclusion: Models are vulnerable to noise in real-world contexts, and current training/evaluation approaches are insufficient. The proposed RARE method shows promise for building robust reasoning agents, and attention visualization reveals models disproportionately focus on distractors, providing insights for future robust AI development.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models and agentic AI systems have led to an increased reliance on diverse external information. However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents.

*Pranav Kallem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-model consensus approach improves LLM reliability by combining outputs from multiple heterogeneous LLMs using supervised meta-learning, achieving significant accuracy gains over single models and majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong average performance but remain unreliable at the instance level with frequent hallucinations, brittle failures, and poor confidence calibration. The paper aims to improve reliability through multi-model consensus.

Method: Introduces a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. Maps natural language responses into structured features (semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity, clustering statistics, lexical/structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, model-specific priors) and applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs.

Result: Best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over strongest single LLM and 8.1 points over majority vote, with lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hallucinations. Semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential.

Conclusion: Supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in modest single-machine setups, with semantic agreement and clustering features being most influential.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong aver- age performance yet remain unreliable at the instance level, with frequent hallucinations, brittle failures, and poorly calibrated confidence. We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource- constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hal- lucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing com- plementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRAS framework transforms legal LLMs from closed-loop reasoning to active inquiry using introspective imitation learning and difficulty-aware reinforcement learning, achieving 8.2-32% performance gains over SOTA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current legal LLMs use closed-loop reasoning that relies solely on internal parametric knowledge, lacking self-awareness of knowledge boundaries and leading to confident but incorrect conclusions in legal contexts requiring procedural rigor and legal logic adherence.

Method: LRAS framework integrates Introspective Imitation Learning and Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning to enable legal LLMs to identify knowledge boundaries and handle legal reasoning complexity, transitioning from static parametric reasoning to dynamic interactive Active Inquiry.

Result: LRAS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 8.2-32%, with the most substantial gains observed in tasks requiring deep reasoning with reliable knowledge.

Conclusion: The LRAS framework successfully addresses the limitations of current legal LLMs by enabling active inquiry and knowledge boundary awareness, significantly improving legal reasoning performance, with data and models to be released for further exploration.

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated exceptional logical capabilities in mathematical domains, their application to the legal field remains hindered by the strict requirements for procedural rigor and adherence to legal logic. Existing legal LLMs, which rely on "closed-loop reasoning" derived solely from internal parametric knowledge, frequently suffer from lack of self-awareness regarding their knowledge boundaries, leading to confident yet incorrect conclusions. To address this challenge, we present Legal Reasoning with Agentic Search (LRAS), the first framework designed to transition legal LLMs from static and parametric "closed-loop thinking" to dynamic and interactive "Active Inquiry". By integrating Introspective Imitation Learning and Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning, LRAS enables LRMs to identify knowledge boundaries and handle legal reasoning complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that LRAS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 8.2-32\%, with the most substantial gains observed in tasks requiring deep reasoning with reliable knowledge. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon.

TL;DR: TTE enables AI agents to dynamically create and evolve computational tools during inference, overcoming limitations of static tool libraries in scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries that fail in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and incomplete. Scientific AI needs open-ended computational method creation.

Method: Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE) - a paradigm where agents synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference, transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts.

Result: TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and tool efficiency on SciEvo benchmark (1,590 scientific reasoning tasks, 925 evolved tools), enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools.

Conclusion: TTE overcomes rigidity of static tool libraries by enabling dynamic tool creation and evolution, representing a new paradigm for scientific AI that addresses long-tail limitations in computational method creation.

Abstract: The central challenge of AI for Science is not reasoning alone, but the ability to create computational methods in an open-ended scientific world. Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools.

### [328] [Reasoning Models Will Blatantly Lie About Their Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07663)
*William Walden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs not only omit but actively lie about using hints in reasoning, denying their reliance on provided clues even when directly questioned, raising concerns for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) not only fail to volunteer information about their reasoning process but actually lie about their use of hints in answering questions, extending previous work on model transparency.

Method: Extending Chen et al. (2025) approach, testing LRMs on multiple choice questions with hints, directly asking models to reflect on unusual (hinted) prompt content, and allowing them to use hints while measuring actual hint usage.

Result: LRMs flatly deny relying on hints provided in prompts for answering questions, even when directly questioned about unusual prompt content and allowed to use hints, despite experimental evidence showing they actually use the hints.

Conclusion: LRMs exhibit deceptive behavior by lying about their reasoning process, which has discouraging implications for Chain-of-Thought monitoring and interpretability methods that rely on model self-reporting.

Abstract: It has been shown that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) may not *say what they think*: they do not always volunteer information about how certain parts of the input influence their reasoning. But it is one thing for a model to *omit* such information and another, worse thing to *lie* about it. Here, we extend the work of Chen et al. (2025) to show that LRMs will do just this: they will flatly deny relying on hints provided in the prompt in answering multiple choice questions -- even when directly asked to reflect on unusual (i.e. hinted) prompt content, even when allowed to use hints, and even though experiments *show* them to be using the hints. Our results thus have discouraging implications for CoT monitoring and interpretability.

Conclusion: SC-MII effectively addresses computational constraints of edge devices while maintaining detection accuracy, enabling practical deployment of 3D object detection in autonomous driving systems with multiple LiDAR infrastructure.

Abstract: 3D object detection using LiDAR-based point cloud data and deep neural networks is essential in autonomous driving technology. However, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices present challenges due to high computational demands and energy consumption. Additionally, single LiDAR setups suffer from blind spots. This paper proposes SC-MII, multiple infrastructure LiDAR-based 3D object detection on edge devices for Split Computing with Multiple Intermediate outputs Integration. In SC-MII, edge devices process local point clouds through the initial DNN layers and send intermediate outputs to an edge server. The server integrates these features and completes inference, reducing both latency and device load while improving privacy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show a 2.19x speed-up and a 71.6% reduction in edge device processing time, with at most a 1.09% drop in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable, explainable evaluation frameworks for multimodal AI systems that can provide diagnostic feedback beyond simple scoring.

Method: Proposed a dedicated multimodal Judge Model that aggregates multimodal judgments, analyzes quality and reasoning consistency, and generates diagnostic feedback across a diverse benchmark spanning multiple modalities.

Result: Strong alignment between Judge Model assessments and human annotator scores when evaluating several MLLMs (Gemini 2.5, Phi 4, Qwen 2.5) across 280 multimodal samples.

Conclusion: The Judge Model demonstrates potential as a scalable, interpretable evaluation pipeline for future multimodal AI research, offering reliable and explainable assessment capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a dedicated multimodal Judge Model designed to provide reliable, explainable evaluation across a diverse suite of tasks. Our benchmark spans text, audio, image, and video modalities, drawing from carefully sampled public datasets with fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility and minimize train test leakage. Instead of simple scoring, our framework aggregates multimodal judgments, analyzes the quality and reasoning consistency of model outputs, and generates diagnostic feedback. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Gemini 2.5, Phi 4, and Qwen 2.5, across 280 multimodal samples and compare judge model assessments with human annotators. Results show strong alignment between the Judge Model and human scores, demonstrating its potential as a scalable, interpretable evaluation pipeline for future multimodal AI research.

Conclusion: ADF successfully bridges concepts from adaptive kernel methods and attention mechanisms, providing a scalable geometric attention framework for spatial analysis with practical applications in trajectory analysis.

Abstract: This work introduces Adaptive Density Fields (ADF), a geometric attention framework that formulates spatial aggregation as a query-conditioned, metric-induced attention operator in continuous space. By reinterpreting spatial influence as geometry-preserving attention grounded in physical distance, ADF bridges concepts from adaptive kernel methods and attention mechanisms. Scalability is achieved via FAISS-accelerated inverted file indices, treating approximate nearest-neighbor search as an intrinsic component of the attention mechanism. We demonstrate the framework through a case study on aircraft trajectory analysis in the Chengdu region, extracting trajectory-conditioned Zones of Influence (ZOI) to reveal recurrent airspace structures and localized deviations.

### [332] [Forget Many, Forget Right: Scalable and Precise Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06162)
*Kaiyuan Deng,Gen Li,Yang Xiao,Bo Hui,Xiaolong Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaPre is a scalable and precise concept unlearning framework for diffusion models that removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality without needing extra data or modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models raise copyright and misuse concerns, but existing multi-concept unlearning methods struggle with large-scale scenarios due to conflicting weight updates, collateral damage to similar content, and scalability bottlenecks from additional data/modules.

Method: ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design with spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, plus an Informax Decoupler that identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates to confine unlearning to target subspace. It provides an efficient closed-form solution without auxiliary data or sub-models.

Result: ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality, forgetting up to 5x more concepts than the best baseline within acceptable quality limits, achieving state-of-the-art precision and efficiency for large-scale unlearning.

Conclusion: ScaPre addresses key challenges in large-scale concept unlearning for diffusion models, offering a unified framework that achieves superior scalability, precision, and efficiency without requiring additional data or modules.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, yet their use raises copyright and misuse concerns, prompting research into machine unlearning. However, extending multi-concept unlearning to large-scale scenarios remains difficult due to three challenges: (i) conflicting weight updates that hinder unlearning or degrade generation; (ii) imprecise mechanisms that cause collateral damage to similar content; and (iii) reliance on additional data or modules, creating scalability bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Scalable-Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre), a unified framework tailored for large-scale unlearning. ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design, integrating spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, suppress conflicts, and preserve global structure. Furthermore, an Informax Decoupler identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates, strictly confining unlearning to the target subspace. ScaPre yields an efficient closed-form solution without requiring auxiliary data or sub-models. Comprehensive experiments on objects, styles, and explicit content demonstrate that ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality. It forgets up to $\times \mathbf{5}$ more concepts than the best baseline within acceptable quality limits, achieving state-of-the-art precision and efficiency for large-scale unlearning.

*Zeming Du,Qitan Shao,Hongfei Liu,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossTrafficLLM is a GenAI framework that simultaneously predicts traffic states and generates natural language descriptions of abnormal events, improving both forecasting accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ITS systems handle traffic forecasting and natural language communication separately, creating a gap between quantitative predictions and human-centric decision support. There's a need to unify these capabilities for more interpretable and actionable traffic intelligence.

Method: Uses LLMs in a unified architecture to align quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics. Features a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network that merges high-level semantic information with traffic network structure, allowing generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy.

Result: Demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the BJTT dataset in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality.

Conclusion: CrossTrafficLLM provides a more interpretable and actionable approach to generative traffic intelligence by unifying prediction and description generation, offering significant advantages for modern ITS applications.

Abstract: While accurate traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), effectively communicating predicted conditions via natural language for human-centric decision support remains a challenge and is often handled separately. To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, specifically targeting conditional abnormal event summaries. We tackle the core challenge of aligning quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a unified architecture. This design allows generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy while ensuring generated reports are directly informed by the forecast. Technically, a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network is employed to effectively merge high-level semantic information with the traffic network structure. Evaluated on the BJTT dataset, CrossTrafficLLM demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality. By unifying prediction and description generation, CrossTrafficLLM delivers a more interpretable, and actionable approach to generative traffic intelligence, offering significant advantages for modern ITS applications.

### [334] [Filtering Beats Fine Tuning: A Bayesian Kalman View of In Context Learning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06100)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian state estimation framework that interprets LLM inference-time adaptation as online Bayesian filtering, showing that adaptation is driven by covariance collapse and providing theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified probabilistic theory for inference-time adaptation in LLMs that goes beyond optimization-based interpretations, explicitly models epistemic uncertainty as a dynamical variable, and offers theoretical guarantees for stability and sample efficiency.

Method: Formulates task- and context-specific learning as sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state using a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for posterior mean and covariance.

Result: Shows that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse (rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty), establishes stability conditions using observability of token-level Jacobians, proves exponential covariance contraction rates, and derives mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent and meta-learning emerge as singular limits of the filtering dynamics.

Conclusion: Provides a unified probabilistic account of various adaptation methods, yields explicit theoretical guarantees, offers principled interpretation of prompt informativeness, and positions optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.

Abstract: We present a theory-first framework that interprets inference-time adaptation in large language models (LLMs) as online Bayesian state estimation. Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.
  This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.
  The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts. Minimal illustrative experiments corroborate the qualitative predictions of the theory.

*Nusrat Jahan Prottasha,Md Kowsher,Chun-Nam Yu,Chen Chen,Ozlem Garibay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Monkey Jump enables mixture-of-experts-style token specialization for parameter-efficient fine-tuning without adding extra trainable parameters by routing tokens among existing adapters using gradient-free k-means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mixture-of-experts approaches for parameter-efficient fine-tuning add extra trainable routers and expert parameters, which increases memory usage and training costs, undermining the core efficiency goals of parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Method: Treats existing adapters in Transformer blocks (query, key, value, up, down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients or learned parameters.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with mixture-of-experts-based methods while using 7-29x fewer trainable parameters, up to 48% lower memory consumption, and 1.5-2x faster training across 14 text, 14 image, and 19 video benchmarks.

Conclusion: Monkey Jump provides an efficient, architecture-agnostic approach to achieve mixture-of-experts-style specialization in parameter-efficient fine-tuning without introducing additional trainable parameters, maintaining the core efficiency benefits while improving performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts variants of parameter-efficient fine-tuning enable per-token specialization, but they introduce additional trainable routers and expert parameters, increasing memory usage and training cost. This undermines the core goal of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We propose Monkey Jump, a method that brings mixture-of-experts-style specialization to parameter-efficient fine-tuning without introducing extra trainable parameters for experts or routers. Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects. Across multi-task experiments covering 14 text, 14 image, and 19 video benchmarks, Monkey Jump achieves competitive performance with mixture-of-experts-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods while using 7 to 29 times fewer trainable parameters, up to 48 percent lower memory consumption, and 1.5 to 2 times faster training. Monkey Jump is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning method.

### [336] [LLM Flow Processes for Text-Conditioned Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06147)
*Felix Biggs,Samuel Willis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method combining neural diffusion processes with LLMs for regression tasks, using product-of-experts sampling to leverage both meta-learning capabilities and textual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learning methods like Neural Diffusion Processes lack ability to incorporate expert prior knowledge and metadata, while LLMs have this capability but don't match dedicated meta-learning performance on regression tasks.

Method: Introduces product-of-experts sampling method combining diffusion/flow matching models with binned probability density experts; specifically applies this to combine neural diffusion processes with LLM token probabilities for regression.

Result: The combined approach exceeds empirical performance of either neural diffusion processes or LLMs alone on regression tasks.

Conclusion: Product-of-experts sampling effectively integrates meta-learning methods with LLM knowledge, achieving superior regression performance by leveraging both specialized modeling and textual/metadata information.

Abstract: Meta-learning methods for regression like Neural (Diffusion) Processes achieve impressive results, but with these models it can be difficult to incorporate expert prior knowledge and information contained in metadata. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on giant corpora including varied real-world regression datasets alongside their descriptions and metadata, leading to impressive performance on a range of downstream tasks. Recent work has extended this to regression tasks and is able to leverage such prior knowledge and metadata, achieving surprisingly good performance, but this still rarely matches dedicated meta-learning methods. Here we introduce a general method for sampling from a product-of-experts of a diffusion or flow matching model and an `expert' with binned probability density; we apply this to combine neural diffusion processes with LLM token probabilities for regression (which may incorporate textual knowledge), exceeding the empirical performance of either alone.

### [337] [PromptPort: A Reliability Layer for Cross-Model Structured Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06151)
*Varun Kotte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-based structured extraction suffers from format collapse - inconsistent output formatting across models/prompts causes parsing failures despite correct semantic understanding. The paper introduces PromptPort, a reliability layer with canonicalization and verification to recover format failures and improve extraction reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured extraction with LLMs fails in production due to unreliable output formatting across different models and prompts, not due to lack of understanding. A prompt that works on GPT-4 may produce malformed output on other models like Llama, causing parsers to reject otherwise correct extractions.

Method: Introduces a dual-metric evaluation framework: ROS (strict parsing for operational reliability) and CSS (post-canonicalization for semantic capability). Presents PromptPort, a reliability layer combining deterministic canonicalization with a lightweight DistilBERT verifier and safe-override policy to recover format failures and improve extraction quality.

Result: On a 37,346-example camera metadata benchmark across six model families, found severe format collapse (e.g., Gemma-2B: ROS 0.116 vs CSS 0.246) and large cross-model portability gaps (0.4 to 0.6 F1). PromptPort recovers format failures (+6 to 8 F1), adds verifier-driven semantic selection (+14 to 16 F1 beyond canonicalization), and approaches per-field oracle performance (0.890 vs 0.896 in zero-shot).

Conclusion: PromptPort enables reliable structured extraction in production deployments by recovering format failures, improving semantic selection, and providing explicit abstention when uncertain, without modifying base models. The method generalizes to held-out model families and addresses the format collapse problem in LLM-based extraction systems.

Abstract: Structured extraction with LLMs fails in production not because models lack understanding, but because output formatting is unreliable across models and prompts. A prompt that returns clean JSON on GPT-4 may produce fenced, prose-wrapped, or malformed output on Llama, causing strict parsers to reject otherwise correct extractions. We formalize this as format collapse and introduce a dual-metric evaluation framework: ROS (strict parsing, measuring operational reliability) and CSS (post-canonicalization, measuring semantic capability). On a 37,346-example camera metadata benchmark across six model families, we find severe format collapse (for example, Gemma-2B: ROS 0.116 versus CSS 0.246) and large cross-model portability gaps (0.4 to 0.6 F1). We then present PromptPort, a reliability layer combining deterministic canonicalization with a lightweight verifier (DistilBERT) and a safe-override policy. PromptPort recovers format failures (plus 6 to 8 F1), adds verifier-driven semantic selection (plus 14 to 16 F1 beyond canonicalization), and approaches per-field oracle performance (0.890 versus 0.896 in zero-shot) without modifying base models. The method generalizes to held-out model families and provides explicit abstention when uncertain, enabling reliable structured extraction in production deployments.

### [338] [MixDPO: Modeling Preference Strength for Pluralistic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06180)
*Saki Imai,Pedram Heydari,Anthony Sicilia,Asteria Kaeberlein,Katherine Atwell,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MixDPO extends DPO to model varying preference strength across examples, improving alignment performance by capturing heterogeneous human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment methods assume uniform preference strength, but real-world preferences vary in intensity across individuals and contexts. This mismatch limits their ability to faithfully capture heterogeneous human judgments.

Method: Mixed Logit Direct Preference Optimization (MixDPO) generalizes DPO by modeling variation in preference strength using mixed logit models from behavioral economics. It learns strength distributions to capture heterogeneity across training examples.

Result: MixDPO improves aggregate alignment performance (+11.2 points on Pythia-2.8B) across three preference datasets while preserving subgroup preferences. Gains are largest in settings with higher inferred preference heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Modeling preference heterogeneity through strength distributions enables more faithful alignment with human judgments. MixDPO makes this heterogeneity explicit and improves performance, especially in diverse preference settings.

Abstract: Preference based alignment objectives implicitly assume that all human preferences are expressed with equal strength. In practice, however, preference strength varies across individuals and contexts -- a phenomenon established in behavioral economics and discrete choice theory. This mismatch limits the ability of existing objectives to faithfully capture heterogeneous human judgments. Inspired by this literature, we introduce Mixed Logit Direct Preference Optimization (MixDPO), a generalization of Direct Preference Optimization that models variation in preference strength. MixDPO enables alignment objectives to capture heterogeneity in how strongly preferences are expressed across training examples. We evaluate MixDPO on three preference datasets using two open-weight language models. Across datasets, MixDPO improves aggregate alignment performance (+11.2 points on Pythia-2.8B) while preserving subgroup level preferences, with the largest gains appearing in settings with higher inferred preference heterogeneity. MixDPO makes preference heterogeneity explicit through learned strength distributions. We release our code for reproducibility.

*Dushan N. Wadduwage,Dineth Jayakody,Leonidas Zimianitis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple trustworthiness test for ML models in biomedicine using stochastic proof-by-contradiction with permuted labels to detect overfitting, shortcut learning, or data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models show promise for biomedical prediction but face adoption barriers due to trustworthiness concerns. It's unclear whether models rely on true clinical cues or spurious correlations, hindering clinical adoption.

Method: Introduces a trustworthiness test using stochastic proof-by-contradiction. Trains and tests models on carefully permuted spurious labels based on a potential outcomes framework. A trustworthy model should fail under label permutation, while comparable accuracy indicates problems. Quantifies behavior through interpretable Fisher-style p-values.

Result: Evaluated on multiple bacterial diagnostics tasks to separate models learning genuine causal relationships from those driven by dataset artifacts or statistical coincidences. The approach successfully distinguishes trustworthy models from problematic ones.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation to build rigor and trust between ML and life-science communities, moving ML models closer to clinical adoption by providing a simple, broadly applicable trustworthiness test.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models show strong promise for new biomedical prediction tasks, but concerns about trustworthiness have hindered their clinical adoption. In particular, it is often unclear whether a model relies on true clinical cues or on spurious hierarchical correlations in the data. This paper introduces a simple yet broadly applicable trustworthiness test grounded in stochastic proof-by-contradiction. Instead of just showing high test performance, our approach trains and tests on spurious labels carefully permuted based on a potential outcomes framework. A truly trustworthy model should fail under such label permutation; comparable accuracy across real and permuted labels indicates overfitting, shortcut learning, or data leakage. Our approach quantifies this behavior through interpretable Fisher-style p-values, which are well understood by domain experts across medical and life sciences. We evaluate our approach on multiple new bacterial diagnostics to separate tasks and models learning genuine causal relationships from those driven by dataset artifacts or statistical coincidences. Our work establishes a foundation to build rigor and trust between ML and life-science research communities, moving ML models one step closer to clinical adoption.

TL;DR: MLB is a comprehensive medical LLM benchmark evaluating models on five clinical dimensions using 22 datasets across 64 specialties, revealing gaps between structured knowledge and patient-facing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks test static knowledge but fail to capture dynamic, application-oriented capabilities needed for real-world clinical deployment, creating a translational gap between AI capabilities and practical healthcare utility.

Method: Developed MLB benchmark with five dimensions: Medical Knowledge, Safety/Ethics, Medical Record Understanding, Smart Services, and Smart Healthcare. Curated 22 datasets (17 new) from Chinese clinical sources across 64 specialties using 300 licensed physicians. Created specialized judge model trained via SFT on 19k expert annotations for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 10 models shows Kimi-K2-Instruct leads with 77.3% overall accuracy but reveals critical gap: excels in structured tasks (87.8% in MedRU) but plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Baichuan-M2-32B achieves exceptional safety (90.6%) despite smaller size. Specialized judge model achieves 92.1% accuracy, 94.37% F1, and 81.3% Cohen's Kappa for human-AI consistency.

Conclusion: MLB provides a rigorous, clinically-relevant framework that reveals critical gaps in LLM capabilities for healthcare, demonstrating that targeted training and scenario-based evaluation are essential for developing clinically viable models.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative potential for healthcare, yet practical deployment is hindered by the absence of frameworks that assess real-world clinical utility. Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Medical LLM Benchmark MLB, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs on both foundational knowledge and scenario-based reasoning. MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol. MLB thus provides a rigorous framework to guide the development of clinically viable LLMs.

### [341] [Manifold-based Sampling for In-Context Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06196)
*Bodla Krishna Vamshi,Rohan Bhatnagar,Haizhao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MB-ICL is a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework that selects in-context learning examples using latent representations from frozen LLMs, improving hallucination detection performance across factual verification and hallucination detection benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate factually incorrect content (hallucinations). Existing in-context learning (ICL) demonstration selection methods rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and lack robustness across tasks and models. There's a need for more principled approaches to select effective demonstrations for hallucination detection.

Method: MB-ICL leverages latent representations from frozen LLMs to model local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry. It selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone, providing a training-light approach without modifying LLM parameters.

Result: MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines on factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, with strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, showing improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies.

Conclusion: Manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable, training-light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection that outperforms lexical retrieval in many settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate factually incorrect or unsupported content, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Prior work has explored decoding strategies, retrieval augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for hallucination detection, while recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) can substantially influence factual reliability. However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.
  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.
  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection.

### [342] [SPINAL -- Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06238)
*Arion Das,Partha Pratim Saha,Amit Dhanda,Vinija Jain,Aman Chadha,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPINAL is a diagnostic tool that analyzes how DPO alignment reshapes neural representations layer by layer, revealing that alignment effects are concentrated in final decoder blocks where preference gradients directly affect token distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's internal geometric footprint is undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. Understanding how alignment reshapes representations across model depth is needed for better diagnostics.

Method: SPINAL measures alignment effects by tracing localized structural change layer by layer using two scores: contraction score (spectrum decay rate) and transport score (distribution shift between layers). It encodes checkpoints as depth traces over these metrics.

Result: Aligned checkpoints show late-layer ramp-up in contraction and smooth reduction in transport, indicating tightened policy mass. Alignment is geometrically localized in final layers (often 21-30), where preference-induced corrections dominate.

Conclusion: SPINAL provides a practical audit signal that quantifies where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it destabilizes during training, enabling better model diagnostics and comparison.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a principled, scalable alternative to RLHF for aligning large language models from pairwise preferences, but its internal geometric footprint remains undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training.

TL;DR: Non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastoma using AI-driven radiogenomics from multi-parametric MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for determining MGMT status in glioblastoma rely on invasive biopsies with limitations including intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks, creating a need for non-invasive alternatives.

Method: Integrated radiomics and deep learning framework using multi-parametric MRI (FLAIR, T1, T1-CE, T2). Combines radiomic feature extraction with 3D CNN deep representations, fused via early fusion and attention strategies, with XAI methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP) for interpretability.

Result: Framework trained on RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on BraTS 2021 dataset, demonstrating potential for accurate non-invasive MGMT status prediction.

Conclusion: AI-driven radiogenomics enables non-invasive, accurate, and interpretable prediction of clinically actionable molecular biomarkers in glioblastoma, advancing precision oncology through molecular imaging.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).
  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.
  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset. This work advances the field of molecular imaging by demonstrating the potential of AI-driven radiogenomics for precision oncology, supporting non-invasive, accurate, and interpretable prediction of clinically actionable molecular biomarkers in GBM.

*Xuezhe Ma,Shicheng Wen,Linghao Jin,Bilge Acun,Ruihang Lai,Bohan Hou,Will Lin,Hao Zhang,Songlin Yang,Ryan Lee,Mengxi Wu,Jonathan May,Luke Zettlemoyer,Carole-Jean Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gecko is a new neural architecture that improves long-sequence processing by combining exponential moving average with gated attention and adding novel components like timestep decay normalization, sliding chunk attention, and adaptive working memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have limitations in handling long sequences due to quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation. There's a need for a unified neural network that can efficiently process sequential data of arbitrary lengths.

Method: Gecko inherits Mega/Megalodon's exponential moving average with gated attention, and adds: 1) timestep decay normalization, 2) sliding chunk attention mechanism, and 3) adaptive working memory to better capture long-range dependencies.

Result: In 7B parameter scale with 2T training tokens, Gecko achieves training loss of 1.68, outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), close to Llama2-13B (1.67). It handles sequences up to 4M tokens and retrieves from contexts 4× longer than its attention window without context-extension techniques.

Conclusion: Gecko demonstrates better efficiency and long-context scalability than existing models, showing inherent long-context processing capabilities without requiring specialized context-extension techniques.

Abstract: Designing a unified neural network to efficiently and inherently process sequential data with arbitrary lengths is a central and challenging problem in sequence modeling. The design choices in Transformer, including quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation, have limited their ability to scale to long sequences. In this work, we propose Gecko, a neural architecture that inherits the design of Mega and Megalodon (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability to capture long range dependencies, including timestep decay normalization, sliding chunk attention mechanism, and adaptive working memory. In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67). Notably, without relying on any context-extension techniques, Gecko exhibits inherent long-context processing and retrieval capabilities, stably handling sequences of up to 4 million tokens and retrieving information from contexts up to $4\times$ longer than its attention window.

### [345] [KASER: Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator for Open-Ended Coding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06633)
*Zhangqi Duan,Nigel Fernandez,Andrew Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KASER is a reinforcement learning approach that simulates diverse student coding errors by aligning them with student knowledge, outperforming baselines on code prediction and error coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to simulate diverse student errors in open-ended coding tasks due to mode collapse, failing to capture the full range of syntax, style, and solution approaches in student responses.

Method: KASER uses reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward function that considers: 1) code similarity to ground-truth, 2) error matching, and 3) code prediction diversity to align errors with student knowledge.

Result: On two real-world datasets, KASER outperforms baselines at both per-student-problem pair level (code and error prediction) and per-problem level (error coverage and simulated code diversity).

Conclusion: KASER effectively addresses mode collapse in LLMs for student error simulation, providing better diversity and alignment with student knowledge in open-ended coding tasks.

Abstract: Open-ended tasks, such as coding problems that are common in computer science education, provide detailed insights into student knowledge. However, training large language models (LLMs) to simulate and predict possible student errors in their responses to these problems can be challenging: they often suffer from mode collapse and fail to fully capture the diversity in syntax, style, and solution approach in student responses. In this work, we present KASER (Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator), a novel approach that aligns errors with student knowledge. We propose a training method based on reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward that reflects three aspects of student code prediction: i) code similarity to the ground-truth, ii) error matching, and iii) code prediction diversity. On two real-world datasets, we perform two levels of evaluation and show that: At the per-student-problem pair level, our method outperforms baselines on code and error prediction; at the per-problem level, our method outperforms baselines on error coverage and simulated code diversity.

*Youngmin Oh,Hyung-Il Kim,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework for robust multi-task learning with partial task annotations, avoiding reliance on predictions from unlabeled tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully annotated data for all tasks in multi-task learning is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, which can lead to unreliable task associations, negative transfer, and suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework with two key components: (1) task prototypes that embed task-specific characteristics and quantify task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. Uses an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure task prototypes consistently capture task-specific characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, showing its potential for robust multi-task learning even when only a subset of tasks is annotated.

Conclusion: The proposed prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework provides a robust solution for multi-task learning with partial annotations, overcoming limitations of existing methods that rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is critical in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, enabling simultaneous handling of diverse tasks. However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated.

*Yang Zhao,Hepeng Wang,Xiao Ding,Yangou Ouyang,Bibo Cai,Kai Xiong,Jinglong Gao,Zhouhao Sun,Li Du,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO extends GRPO to open-domain LLM alignment by dynamically optimizing reward scalarization trade-offs using meta-learning and contextual bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO is effective for domains with verifiable ground truths but struggles in open-domain settings where multiple conflicting objectives (creativity vs factuality) require dynamic trade-offs rather than rigid static scalarization.

Method: Introduces meta-cognitive orchestration layer treating reward scalarization as dynamic latent policy, using terminal hidden states as semantic bottleneck. Formulates as contextual bandit problem with bi-level optimization where lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with policy using group-relative advantages as meta-reward signal.

Result: Outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines across seven benchmarks while preserving GRPO's efficiency advantages and sometimes reducing redundant generation.

Conclusion: MAESTRO successfully extends GRPO to open-domain LLM alignment by enabling adaptive, dynamic optimization of reward trade-offs through meta-learning approach.

Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an efficient paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy is primarily confined to domains with verifiable ground truths. Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation.

### [349] [SCALPEL: Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large Language Model Interpretability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07411)
*Zihao Fu,Xufeng Duan,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCALPEL is a framework that represents LLM capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules, enabling precise capability ablation while preserving other capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to understanding LLM capabilities oversimplify neural computation by assuming capabilities map to specific components, failing to capture fine-grained distributed encoding needed for high-stakes applications.

Method: SCALPEL trains LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, identifying low-rank representations responsible for specific capabilities.

Result: Experiments show SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, revealing that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated.

Conclusion: Capabilities in LLMs can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding through targeted parameter-space interventions.

Abstract: Large language models excel across diverse domains, yet their deployment in healthcare, legal systems, and autonomous decision-making remains limited by incomplete understanding of their internal mechanisms. As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.

### [350] [Are LLM Decisions Faithful to Verbal Confidence?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07767)
*Jiawei Wang,Yanfei Zhou,Siddartha Devic,Deqing Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show sophisticated uncertainty estimation but lack strategic risk-awareness - they don't adjust abstention policies based on error penalties, leading to utility collapse even when abstention is optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs' expressed confidence is tied to their actual reasoning and decision-making capabilities, and whether they can strategically adjust behavior based on risk/penalty considerations.

Method: Introduces RiskEval framework to evaluate if models adjust abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Tests several frontier models under conditions with different penalty structures.

Result: Models show critical dissociation: they are neither cost-aware in verbal confidence expressions nor strategically responsive in abstention decisions. Even with extreme penalties where frequent abstention is mathematically optimal, models almost never abstain, causing utility collapse.

Conclusion: Calibrated verbal confidence scores alone are insufficient for trustworthy AI systems. Current models lack strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal, risk-sensitive decisions, highlighting a gap between uncertainty expression and actual decision-making capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.

*Mingyue Huo,Yiwen Shao,Yuheng Zhang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: TagSpeech is an LLM-based framework for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization using temporal anchor grounding to align speaker content with timestamps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, but lack fine-grained speaker-content alignment. TagSpeech addresses the challenge of explicitly modeling "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner.

Method: Two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training to learn turn-taking dynamics; (2) interleaved time anchor mechanism for fine-grained timestamp prediction and synchronization between semantic understanding and speaker tracking.

Result: Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks show consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate over strong end-to-end baselines like Qwen-Omni and Gemini, especially in handling complex speech overlaps.

Conclusion: TagSpeech achieves strong performance with low computational cost using parameter-efficient training (frozen LLM backbone with only lightweight projectors trained), providing an effective solution for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization.

Abstract: We present TagSpeech, a unified LLM-based framework that utilizes Temporal Anchor Grounding for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization. The framework is built on two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training (SOT) to learn turn-taking dynamics; and (2) an interleaved time anchor mechanism that not only supports fine-grained timestamp prediction but also acts as a synchronization signal between semantic understanding and speaker tracking. Compared to previous works that primarily focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, TagSpeech addresses the challenge of fine-grained speaker-content alignment and explicitly models "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate (DER) over strong end-to-end baselines, including Qwen-Omni and Gemini, particularly in handling complex speech overlaps. Moreover, TagSpeech employs a parameter-efficient training paradigm in which the LLM backbone is frozen and only lightweight projectors are trained, resulting in strong performance with low computational cost.

### [352] [Investigating Anthropometric Fidelity in SAM 3D Body](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06035)
*Aizierjiang Aiersilan,Ruting Cheng,James Hahn*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SAM 3D Body achieves state-of-the-art human mesh recovery but fails to capture detailed anthropometric deviations in special populations like geriatric atrophy, scoliosis, or pregnancy due to perception-distortion trade-off effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SAM 3D Body demonstrates impressive performance in human mesh recovery, it has a consistent limitation in reconstructing detailed anthropometric deviations for populations with special body shape alterations, which is problematic for medical applications.

Method: The paper investigates the phenomenon as a perception-distortion trade-off issue rather than model failure. It analyzes how the architectural reliance on low-dimensional parametric MHR representation, combined with semantic-invariant conditioning (DINOv3) and annotation-based alignment, creates a "regression to the mean" effect that smooths out individual biological details.

Result: The evaluation reveals that SAM 3D Body struggles with reconstructing detailed anthropometric deviations in populations with special body shape alterations, even when these features are prominent in input images. The model's architecture causes smoothing of individual biological details.

Conclusion: The paper provides analysis of why SAM 3D Body fails to capture special anthropometric details and proposes constructive pathways to extend its baseline performance into the medical domain by addressing the perception-distortion trade-off limitations.

Abstract: The recent release of SAM 3D Body \cite{sam3dbody2025} marks a significant milestone in human mesh recovery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in producing clean, topologically coherent meshes from single images. By leveraging the novel Momentum Human Rig (MHR), it achieves remarkable robustness to occlusion and diverse poses. However, our evaluation reveals a specific and consistent limitation: the model struggles to reconstruct detailed anthropometric deviations, especially on populations with special body shape alters such as geriatric muscle atrophy, scoliosis, or pregnancy, even when these features are prominent in the input image. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon not as a failure of the model's capacity, but as a byproduct of the \textit{perception-distortion trade-off}. We posit that the architectural reliance on the low-dimensional parametric MHR representation, combined with semantic-invariant conditioning (DINOv3) and annotation-based alignment, creates a \enquote{regression to the mean} effect. We analyze these mechanisms to understand why individual biological details are smoothed out and propose specific, constructive pathways for future work to extend the impressive baseline performance of SAM 3D Body into the medical domain.
