### [1] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL is an efficient algorithm that bakes activation steering benefits into model weights, reducing hallucinations by 30-40% without real-time intervention during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate by providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance, and existing activation steering methods require real-time monitoring during inference.

Method: Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL) - trains only a submodule of a single transformer layer to directly incorporate activation steering benefits into model weights.

Result: Reduces hallucination by 30-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks, 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than LoRA baselines, and generalizes to OOD domains.

Conclusion: CASAL represents a promising step for applying interpretability-inspired methods in production systems, effective for both dense and MoE models without real-time intervention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

### [2] [Hallucination-Resistant, Domain-Specific Research Assistant with Self-Evaluation and Vector-Grounded Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02326)
*Vivek Bhavsar,Joseph Ereifej,Aravanan Gurusami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RA-FSM is a modular GPT-based research assistant that uses a finite-state control loop (Relevance → Confidence → Knowledge) with vector retrieval and deterministic citation to provide well-grounded, defensible answers for technical domains like photonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but often hallucinate and mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows where accuracy and proper citation are critical.

Method: A modular system with finite-state control loop that filters queries, scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when needed. Uses vector retrieval and deterministic citation pipeline with ranked-tier ingestion from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents.

Result: In blinded A/B reviews, domain experts preferred RA-FSM over Notebook LM and vanilla GPT API, citing better boundary-condition handling and more defensible evidence use. The system explores beyond existing tools while maintaining tunable latency and cost.

Conclusion: RA-FSM provides transparent, well-cited answers for high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains, addressing key limitations of current LLM-based research assistants.

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

### [3] [KAME: Tandem Architecture for Enhancing Knowledge in Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02327)
*So Kuroki,Yotaro Kubo,Takuya Akiba,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid speech-to-speech system that combines real-time S2S responsiveness with LLM knowledge injection to achieve both low latency and rich semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between low-latency but knowledge-poor real-time S2S models and high-latency but knowledge-rich cascaded systems (ASR+LLM+TTS).

Method: Processes speech through S2S transformer for immediate response while concurrently sending query to back-end LLM, then injects LLM's text response in real-time to guide S2S speech generation.

Result: Substantially outperforms baseline S2S in correctness, approaching cascaded system performance, while maintaining baseline latency levels.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture successfully combines the benefits of both paradigms - low latency and rich knowledge - without the full latency penalty of cascaded systems.

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

### [4] [AMANDA: Agentic Medical Knowledge Augmentation for Data-Efficient Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02328)
*Ziqing Wang,Chengsheng Mao,Xiaole Wen,Yuan Luo,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMANDA is a training-free agentic framework that enhances medical multimodal LLMs by addressing intrinsic and extrinsic reasoning bottlenecks through medical knowledge augmentation using LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Med-MLLMs fail in low-resource settings due to two reasoning bottlenecks: intrinsic (ignoring medical image details) and extrinsic (failing to incorporate specialized medical knowledge).

Method: Uses LLM agents for medical knowledge augmentation - intrinsic augmentation via coarse-to-fine question decomposition, and extrinsic augmentation via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks show substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot medical visual question answering settings.

Conclusion: AMANDA effectively addresses medical reasoning bottlenecks and improves Med-MLLM performance in low-resource settings without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

### [5] [SelfJudge: Faster Speculative Decoding via Self-Supervised Judge Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02329)
*Kanghoon Yoon,Minsub Kim,Sungjae Lee,Joonhyung Lee,Sunghyeon Woo,Yeonjun In,Se Jung Kwon,Chanyoung Park,Dongsoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SelfJudge enables faster LLM inference through self-supervised judge decoding that verifies draft tokens based on semantic preservation rather than exact matches, achieving better speed-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing judge decoding methods rely on human annotations or tasks with verifiable ground truths, limiting their generalizability across diverse NLP tasks.

Method: Trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target model by measuring semantic preservation - assessing whether token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses.

Result: SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge decoding baselines across diverse NLP tasks.

Conclusion: SelfJudge offers a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM inference through self-supervised semantic preservation verification.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

### [6] [EntropyLong: Effective Long-Context Training via Predictive Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02330)
*Junlong Jia,Ziyang Chen,Xing Wu,Chaochen Gao,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu,Binghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EntropyLong is a novel data construction method that uses predictive uncertainty to create training data with verified long-range dependencies for language models, improving performance on long-context benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for training long-context language models often fail to guarantee genuine long-range dependencies in training data, leading to suboptimal model performance on tasks requiring distant information.

Method: The method identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy through model-in-the-loop verification.

Result: Models trained on the generated 128K-length sequences with verified dependencies show significant improvements on RULER benchmarks and substantial gains on LongBenchv2 after instruction fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Entropy-based verification is necessary and effective for long-context training, ensuring dependencies represent measurable information gain rather than spurious correlation.

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

### [7] [Synthetic Dialogue Generation for Interactive Conversational Elicitation & Recommendation (ICER)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02331)
*Moonkyung Ryu,Chih-Wei Hsu,Yinlam Chow,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh,Craig Boutilier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of limited public data for conversational recommender systems by developing a methodology to generate consistent, natural dialogues using behavior simulators and language model prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of public conversational recommender system data, making it difficult to fine-tune language models for these systems. Existing approaches using language models as user simulators often lack behavioral consistency.

Method: Developed a methodology combining behavior simulators with language model prompting to generate natural dialogues consistent with users' underlying states. Applied this approach to create a large open-source CRS dataset with preference elicitation and example critiquing.

Result: Generated a large, open-source conversational recommender system dataset. Rater evaluation showed the dialogues exhibit considerable consistency, factuality, and naturalness.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully addresses the data scarcity problem for conversational recommender systems by generating high-quality, consistent dialogues that can be used to train language model-based CRSs.

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

### [8] [A High-Capacity and Secure Disambiguation Algorithm for Neural Linguistic Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02332)
*Yapei Feng,Feng Jiang,Shanhao Wu,Hua Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Look-ahead Sync method improves neural linguistic steganography by maximizing embedding capacity while maintaining provable security, significantly outperforming previous SyncPool method with 160%+ improvement in English and 25%+ in Chinese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the capacity limitation of SyncPool method which sacrifices embedding capacity by using entire Shannon entropy for synchronization rather than payload embedding, due to tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers.

Method: Proposes look-ahead Sync method that performs minimal synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences while strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding capacity.

Result: Experiments on English (Llama 3) and Chinese (Qwen 2.5) benchmarks show the method consistently approaches theoretical capacity upper bound, with embedding rate improvements exceeding 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, especially in settings with larger candidate pools.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography by overcoming capacity limitations while retaining security guarantees.

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

TL;DR: Two publicly available datasets of semantically enriched human trajectories from Paris and New York, featuring GPS traces, contextual layers, and synthetic social media posts generated by LLMs, available in tabular and RDF formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide comprehensive datasets that combine real-world movement data with semantic enrichment and LLM-generated content for multimodal mobility analysis, supporting FAIR data practices and semantic reasoning.

Method: Developed a reproducible pipeline using publicly available GPS traces from OpenStreetMap, enriched with contextual layers (stops, moves, POIs, transportation modes, weather), and generated synthetic social media posts using Large Language Models.

Result: Created two datasets covering Paris and New York in both tabular and RDF formats, enabling semantic reasoning and supporting research tasks like behavior modeling, mobility prediction, and knowledge graph construction.

Conclusion: This resource represents the first framework combining real-world movement data, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web compatibility in a reusable format for mobility research.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based
applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world
movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web
compatibility in a reusable framework.

*Zhe Li,Wei Zhao,Yige Li,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for diagnosing undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation gradients in activation space, enabling efficient sample-level and token-level attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods based on parameter gradients are often noisy and computationally complex, making it difficult to diagnose root causes of LLM failures like harmful content generation, factual inaccuracies, and biases.

Method: Analyzes representation and its gradients directly in the model's activation space to provide semantically meaningful signals linking outputs to training data.

Result: Successfully tracks harmful content, detects backdoor poisoning, and identifies knowledge contamination. Excels at both sample-level attribution and fine-grained token-level analysis.

Conclusion: Provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand, audit, and mitigate risks associated with LLMs, enabling precise identification of specific samples and phrases that causally influence model behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' practical utility as mathematical assistants by testing their ability to fill in missing steps (subgoal completion) in complex proofs, which remains underexplored despite recent progress in formal theorem proving.

Method: Created FormalML benchmark using Lean 4, built from foundational machine learning theories. Used translation tactic to convert procedural proofs into declarative form, extracting 4937 problems with varying difficulty levels. Combines premise retrieval with complex research-level contexts.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers revealed persistent limitations in both accuracy and efficiency when handling subgoal completion tasks in complex mathematical contexts.

Conclusion: Current LLM-based theorem provers are insufficient for effective subgoal completion, highlighting the need for more capable systems to serve as practical assistants for mathematicians.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

TL;DR: CRACQ is a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that assesses documents across five traits: Coherence, Rigor, Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality, providing interpretable automated evaluation beyond traditional essay scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-score evaluation approaches and expand automated assessment beyond essays to diverse machine-generated text, enabling more nuanced and interpretable trait-level analysis.

Method: Builds on trait-based Automated Essay Scoring (AES) principles, integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural signals into cumulative assessment, uses rubric-driven methodology, trained on 500 synthetic grant proposals, and benchmarked against LLM-as-a-judge.

Result: CRACQ produces more stable and interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though challenges in reliability and domain scope remain.

Conclusion: CRACQ provides a promising framework for multi-dimensional document evaluation with better interpretability than LLM-based approaches, but requires further refinement for reliability and broader domain applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though

*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with DocLens evaluator for automated clinical documentation, improving factuality and completeness without separate reward models or human references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate clinical documentation with precise alignment on priorities like completeness and factual grounding, addressing the need for accurate and comprehensive medical notes.

Method: Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) coupled with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator providing dialogue-grounded rewards. Includes reward-gating strategy to reduce training costs and directly optimizes factual grounding and completeness.

Result: Improves clinical note quality, reduces training costs, and receives higher preference in GPT-5 qualitative evaluation for factuality, completeness, and brevity with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Results likely represent conservative lower bounds.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable to real-world clinical settings and can incorporate custom objectives like guideline adherence or billing preferences, providing an effective approach for automated clinical documentation.

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

TL;DR: This paper explores uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs) in claim verification tasks, finding that simple direct prompting outperforms more complex UQ approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliability of LLMs by integrating uncertainty quantification methods into argumentative LLMs, which are explainable frameworks for decision-making based on computational argumentation.

Method: Conducted experiments evaluating ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification tasks using different LLM UQ methods, providing a novel way to assess UQ method effectiveness.

Result: Direct prompting, despite its simplicity, was found to be an effective UQ strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

Conclusion: Simple UQ methods like direct prompting can be highly effective in argumentative LLM frameworks, especially for handling intricate and potentially contentious statements.

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

*Xin Gao,Ruiyi Zhang,Daniel Du,Saurabh Mahindre,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate earlier knowledge cutoffs through prompting for direct factual forgetting but struggle with causally related knowledge, highlighting limitations in temporal prediction evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address contamination concerns in LLM temporal predictions where accurate results may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, and investigate if prompting can simulate earlier knowledge cutoffs.

Method: Constructed three evaluation datasets to test prompting-based unlearning for: (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge.

Result: Prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs work for direct queries but fail to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is causally related to the query.

Conclusion: More rigorous evaluation settings are needed for LLMs in temporal prediction tasks, as current prompting methods have limitations in simulating true knowledge forgetting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full

### [17] [DRIFT: Learning from Abundant User Dissatisfaction in Real-World Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02341)
*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT is a novel preference training method that leverages abundant implicit user dissatisfaction signals from real-world LLM deployments, outperforming existing methods and achieving significant improvements on benchmarks while preserving model diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM deployments generate abundant implicit user dissatisfaction signals (through refinements, corrections, preferences) while explicit satisfaction feedback is scarce, but existing preference learning methods are poorly aligned with this data profile.

Method: DRIFT anchors training on real-world DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy, preserving preference margins and avoiding gradient degeneration.

Result: DRIFT achieves up to +6.23% (7B) / +7.61% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95% (7B) / +12.29% (14B) on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, with 14B models surpassing GPT-4o-mini on WildBench.

Conclusion: DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal while preserving exploratory capacity and avoiding collapse to narrow solution subsets.

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are

TL;DR: SIMPACT is a framework for creating privacy-respecting social media datasets to train LLM-based agents, with BluePrint as a concrete implementation using Bluesky political discourse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic social media agents, making it difficult to conduct ethical studies of social media dynamics at scale.

Method: Developed SIMPACT framework with next-action prediction task, clustering anonymized users into personas, and creating metrics for behavioral fidelity. Built BluePrint dataset from Bluesky data with 12 social media interaction types.

Result: Created BluePrint - a large-scale dataset for political discourse modeling that captures authentic engagement patterns while protecting privacy through pseudonymization and PII removal.

Conclusion: SIMPACT provides standardized data and evaluation protocols for advancing rigorous, ethically responsible social media simulations, with BluePrint serving as both an evaluation benchmark and template for domain-specific studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs that addresses load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead through dynamic expert clustering and structured compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead in MoE LLMs by cohesively addressing these issues through structural reorganization.

Method: Uses dynamic expert clustering based on parameter and activation similarity, decomposes expert weights into shared base matrices and low-rank residual adapters, implements two-stage hierarchical routing, and employs heterogeneous precision with FP16 for shared bases and INT4 for residuals.

Result: Matches standard MoE model quality while reducing total parameters by ~80%, improving throughput by 10-20%, and lowering expert load variance by over 3x on GLUE and WikiText-103 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains through dynamic architecture reconfiguration.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

TL;DR: SLMs can match LLMs in educational AI teaching assistants when using RAG pipelines and proper prompting, offering sustainability benefits with lower computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of small language models (SLMs) as AI teaching assistants for education, addressing the emerging adoption of generative AI while focusing on sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

Method: Developed and evaluated AI teaching assistants using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source SLMs (LLaMA 3.1, IBM Granite 3.3, Gemma 3 with 7-17B parameters), benchmarked against GPT-4o with proper prompting and targeted retrieval.

Result: SLMs can match LLMs in delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. SLMs offer significant sustainability benefits with lower computational and energy requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without cloud dependency.

Conclusion: SLMs are viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions, providing cost-effective, privacy-preserving, and environmentally responsible solutions for scaling personalized learning in a sustainable manner.

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original vec2vec method achieves near-perfect alignment but is expensive and unstable, limiting its practical adoption and scalability.

Method: Three-stage approach: tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement to learn a linear transformation.

Result: Exceeds vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency while matching or exceeding their alignment results, with high robustness and stability.

Conclusion: mini-vec2vec's stability, efficiency, and interpretable steps enable scaling and unlock new opportunities for adoption across domains.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

TL;DR: LLMSQL is a cleaned and improved version of WikiSQL dataset designed for modern LLMs, addressing structural and annotation issues to enable better natural language to SQL conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL dataset had various issues including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions that limited its effectiveness for modern Text-to-SQL research with large language models.

Method: Systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL through error classification and implementation of automated methods for cleaning and re-annotation, making it suitable for LLM-based approaches.

Result: Created LLMSQL as an LLM-ready benchmark with clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

Conclusion: LLMSQL serves as a modern replacement for WikiSQL, specifically designed for the LLM era with clean data and proper formatting that facilitates direct natural language to SQL query generation and evaluation.

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs with reasoning capabilities are more consistent and sensitive in assessing offensiveness across political perspectives and languages, while smaller models struggle with subtle distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs evaluate offensiveness in political discourse when adopting specific political and cultural perspectives across different languages.

Method: Evaluated multiple LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, Mistral) on multilingual MD-Agreement dataset from 2020 US elections, judging tweets as offensive/non-offensive from various political personas across English, Polish, and Russian contexts.

Result: Larger models with explicit reasoning abilities showed better consistency and sensitivity to ideological/cultural variation, while smaller models often failed to capture subtle distinctions.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities significantly improve personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments, suggesting they are crucial for adapting LLMs to nuanced sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study of biases in spoken dialogue models (SDMs), examining how paralinguistic features like age, gender, and accent affect outputs, particularly in multi-turn conversations with negative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in LLMs have been studied, but their presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models with audio input/output remain unexplored. Paralinguistic features can affect model outputs and potentially exacerbate biases in decision-making and recommendation tasks.

Method: Systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs using Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations. Test both open-source (Qwen2.5-Omni, GLM-4-Voice) and closed-source (GPT-4o Audio, Gemini-2.5-Flash) models, studying multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback.

Result: Closed-source models generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to age and gender. Recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group disparities, and biased decisions may persist in multi-turn conversations.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into biases in end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering guidance for developing fair and reliable audio-based interactive systems. The FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code are released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study shows that abstract meaning representations exist in the language cortex, revealed through neural response predictions using vision and language models with multiple generated images and enriched paraphrases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the human language system represents abstract, form-independent meanings beyond specific linguistic forms.

Method: Modeled neural responses to sentences using vision and language model embeddings, testing multiple generated images and enriched paraphrases to predict language cortex activity.

Result: Aggregating across multiple generated images and enriched paraphrases improved prediction accuracy, sometimes surpassing large language models, suggesting richer semantic representations than current models.

Conclusion: The language cortex maintains highly abstract, form-independent meaning representations that are broader than those captured by current language models.

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

*Guanghao Li,Zhihui Fu,Min Fang,Qibin Zhao,Ming Tang,Chun Yuan,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffuSpec is a training-free framework that uses diffusion language models to generate multi-token drafts in a single forward pass for speculative decoding, achieving up to 3x speedup over autoregressive drafters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in large language models increases latency due to sequential token generation. While speculative decoding helps, many deployments still use AR drafters that limit wall-clock gains through sequential passes.

Method: Uses pretrained diffusion language models to produce multi-token drafts in one forward pass, with causal-consistency path search to extract left-to-right paths from token lattices and adaptive draft-length controller to adjust proposal sizes based on acceptance feedback.

Result: Achieves up to 3x wall-clock speedup across benchmarks compared to autoregressive drafters.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based drafting is established as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for speculative decoding, offering significant latency improvements while remaining compatible with standard AR verifiers.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emission knowledge is fragmented and specialized, making it difficult for non-experts to access and interpret emissions data, which hinders research and management efforts.

Method: Built on curated knowledge base of 10,000+ documents using prompt engineering and question completion techniques; enables interactive natural language analysis of emissions data including querying, visualization, and emission factor recommendations.

Result: Case study in Guangdong Province shows Emission-GPT can extract key insights like point source distributions and sectoral trends directly from raw data using simple prompts; automates traditionally manual workflows.

Conclusion: Emission-GPT serves as a foundational tool for next-generation emission inventory development and scenario-based assessment with its modular and extensible architecture.

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether Spiral of Silence (SoS) dynamics can emerge in LLM collectives through statistical language generation, even though the original theory was developed for human psychology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classical Spiral of Silence theory explains human social behavior but doesn't directly apply to LLMs, raising the question of whether similar conformity dynamics can emerge from purely statistical language generation in LLM collectives.

Method: Proposed an evaluation framework with four controlled conditions varying 'History' and 'Persona' signals. Used trend tests (Mann-Kendall, Spearman's rank) and concentration measures (kurtosis, interquartile range) to assess opinion dynamics.

Result: Experiments showed: history and persona together produce strong majority dominance replicating SoS patterns; history alone induces strong anchoring; persona alone fosters diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating SoS dynamics cannot emerge without historical anchoring.

Conclusion: The work bridges computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

### [30] [ChunkLLM: A Lightweight Pluggable Framework for Accelerating LLMs Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02361)
*Haojie Ouyang,Jianwei Lv,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Xiaojie Wang,Fangxiang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkLLM is a lightweight training framework that addresses Transformer inefficiency through chunk-based attention, achieving up to 4.48x speedup while maintaining 98.64% performance on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models suffer from quadratic complexity in self-attention, leading to computational inefficiencies. Existing methods have issues with semantic incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency.

Method: Proposes QK Adapter (Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) for feature compression and chunk attention, and Chunk Adapter for boundary detection. Uses attention distillation for training and triggers chunk selection only at boundaries during inference.

Result: Achieves comparable performance on short-text benchmarks, maintains 98.64% performance on long-context benchmarks with 48.58% KV cache retention, and achieves up to 4.48x speedup on 120K long texts.

Conclusion: ChunkLLM effectively addresses Transformer inefficiency through chunk-based attention while maintaining performance, offering significant speed improvements for long-text processing.

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

*Matei-Iulian Cocu,Răzvan-Cosmin Cristia,Adrian Marius Dumitran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study examines LLM biases on Romanian historical questions across languages and response formats, finding significant inconsistencies in model responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM biases in historical narratives, recognizing that history is often presented through altered cultural perspectives and LLMs may lack neutrality due to their training data.

Method: Three-stage research process testing LLMs on controversial Romanian historical questions across languages and contexts, comparing binary responses with numeric scale responses to examine response stability.

Result: Binary response stability is relatively high but imperfect and varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from initial binary choices.

Conclusion: LLMs show predisposition to inconsistencies based on language context and response format, with the most consistent models not necessarily being the most accurate or neutral.

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

### [32] [Beyond Manuals and Tasks: Instance-Level Context Learning for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02369)
*Kuntai Cai,Juncheng Liu,Xianglin Yang,Zhaojie Niu,Xiaokui Xiao,Xing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) to address the gap in LLM agents' context by capturing verifiable, reusable facts about specific environment instances, improving task success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents rely on environment manuals and task guidance but lack instance-level context (e.g., object locations, local rules), leading to failures in complex tasks where precise, persistent facts are crucial.

Method: Proposes a task-agnostic method using guided exploration with a TODO forest for action prioritization and a plan-act-extract loop to efficiently gather, validate, and format instance-level facts into a reusable context document.

Result: Experiments in TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter show substantial improvements: ReAct's success rate in TextWorld increased from 37% to 95%, and IGE improved from 81% to 95%, with gains in efficiency.

Conclusion: ILCL transforms one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, complementing existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents by addressing the critical instance-level context gap.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

*Minsung Kim,Dong-Kyum Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Kyomin Jung,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training conditions like intra-document repetition, inconsistent information, and distributional skew help models develop robust strategies for arbitrating between parametric and in-context knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation lacks systematic understanding of how training shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies, risking undesirable behaviors and wasted computational resources.

Method: Train transformer-based language models on synthetic biographies corpus while systematically controlling training conditions like repetition, inconsistency, and distributional skew.

Result: Intra-document repetition fosters both parametric and in-context capabilities. Inconsistent information and distributional skew encourage robust arbitration strategies between knowledge sources.

Conclusion: Non-ideal training properties like inconsistency and skew are important for learning robust knowledge arbitration, offering empirical guidance for pretraining models that harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

*Hadi Pouransari,David Grangier,C Thomas,Michael Kirchhof,Oncel Tuzel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small language models augmented with hierarchical parametric memory banks achieve comparable performance to much larger models by fetching context-dependent memory blocks during pretraining and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models rely on scaling parameters to store world knowledge, which is inefficient and impractical for edge devices with limited memory and compute. Only a fraction of knowledge is used per prompt, making parameter compression unnecessary.

Method: Memory-augmented architecture with small language models accessing large hierarchical parametric memory banks. During pretraining and inference, fetch a small context-dependent memory block and add it to the model. Pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge in memory parameters while the small model captures common knowledge and reasoning.

Result: A 160M-parameter model with 18M-parameter memory from a 4.6B memory bank performs comparably to regular models with over 2x parameters. Hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across transformer architectures, scaling to over 21B parameters.

Conclusion: Memory-augmented small language models with hierarchical parametric memory banks provide an efficient alternative to parameter scaling, enabling comparable performance with significantly fewer parameters while being practical for edge devices.

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

TL;DR: A novel method for selecting the best response from multiple LLMs using calibrated log-likelihood scores, achieving 3-5% improvements across various benchmarks without requiring costly external verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for selecting reliable responses from multiple LLMs rely on expensive external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency methods that need multiple samples from a single model. Multi-LLM systems produce diverse responses but often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency.

Method: Proposes a principled and computationally efficient method using calibrated log-likelihood scores to select the best response from multiple different LLMs, implicitly leveraging the models' inherent knowledge and confidence.

Result: Demonstrates improvements of approximately 4%, 3%, and 5% across debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The calibrated log-likelihood scoring method provides an effective and efficient way to select optimal responses from multiple LLMs, outperforming existing approaches while being computationally efficient and not requiring external verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A rule-driven routing framework that intelligently selects between database and document retrieval paths for LLM question answering, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than static or learned routing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific QA requiring accurate, up-to-date information. While RAG helps, existing systems focus on unstructured documents and overlook relational databases which provide precise, timely information crucial in domains like finance and healthcare.

Method: Proposes a rule-driven routing framework with three components: routing agent that scores augmentation paths using explicit rules, rule-making expert that refines rules using QA feedback, and path-level meta-cache that reuses routing decisions for similar queries.

Result: Experiments on three QA benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed rule-driven routing framework effectively balances database and document retrieval for LLM augmentation, demonstrating superior performance through systematic query routing and adaptive rule refinement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs, which remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. The paper aims to investigate whether LLMs update knowledge similarly to humans and how editing vs unlearning differ as training data increases.

Method: Proposes KnowledgeSmith framework that casts editing and unlearning as constrained optimization problems. Uses an automatic dataset generator providing structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales to study how modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.

Result: LLMs do not exhibit similar updating patterns as humans for different knowledge levels. There exists a consistency-capacity trade-off. The framework provides nuanced insights into knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness.

Conclusion: The findings offer suggestions for designing more reliable and scalable knowledge updating strategies for LLMs, highlighting the importance of systematic evaluation frameworks like KnowledgeSmith.

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM performance for NL-to-SQL translation varies across databases, and existing benchmarks rely on unrealistic ad-hoc query-specific textual hints for domain knowledge.

Method: Systematic framework associating structured domain statements at database level, with retrieval of relevant statements using sub-string level matching.

Result: Evaluation on 11 realistic DB schemas across 5 LLMs shows DB-level structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing approaches, with sub-string match retrieval providing significantly higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Structured domain statements at database level with sub-string match retrieval offer superior performance for NL-to-SQL translation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether explicit sensory prompting can surface latent multimodal structure in text-only LLMs and bring them into closer representational alignment with specialist encoders.

Method: Using sensory prompts ('see' or 'hear') to cue text-only LLMs to resolve next-token predictions as if conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence, without actually supplying such evidence.

Result: Lightweight prompt engineering reliably activates modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Text-only LLMs contain latent multimodal structure that can be surfaced through simple sensory prompting, enabling closer alignment with specialist encoders.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

TL;DR: A framework for studying how transformers learn syntax using probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), revealing parallel learning across subgrammars and challenges with deep recursion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning dynamics of language models, particularly how they acquire syntax, given that current large models achieve impressive results but their learning processes remain poorly understood.

Method: Train small models on synthetic languages generated from PCFGs with controlled grammar complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. Use mathematical proofs for training loss and KL divergence, and empirical analysis of learning patterns.

Result: Transformers learn all subgrammars in parallel (unlike children's sequential learning), subgrammar pretraining improves final loss for smaller models, models develop grammar-aligned internal representations, but struggle with deep recursive structures.

Conclusion: PCFGs provide a versatile testbed for studying transformer learning dynamics, revealing fundamental challenges in how neural networks represent hierarchical syntax and opening new research directions.

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

TL;DR: Cobweb organizes sentence embeddings into a prototype tree for hierarchical document retrieval, providing competitive performance, robustness to embedding quality, and interpretable retrieval paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural document retrieval typically treats corpora as flat vector spaces, underusing corpus structure and lacking transparency in explanations.

Method: Uses Cobweb framework to build prototype tree from sentence embeddings, then ranks documents via coarse-to-fine traversal with two approaches: generalized best-first search and lightweight path-sum ranker.

Result: Matches dot product search performance on strong encoder embeddings (BERT/T5) while remaining robust when kNN degrades - with GPT-2 vectors, dot product collapses but Cobweb still retrieves relevant results.

Conclusion: Cobweb provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality, scalability, and interpretable retrieval through hierarchical prototypes.

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

TL;DR: Extended RAGAS framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm for RAG systems, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic clustering for more comprehensive scoring metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to capture key features of modern LLM-generated content that exhibits high fluency and naturalness, making RAG system evaluation challenging.

Method: Extended the RAGAS framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm with multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive comprehensive scoring metrics.

Result: The KG-based method shows higher sensitivity to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs and better correlation with human judgments compared to RAGAS scores.

Conclusion: The KG-based evaluation provides deeper understanding of RAG systems and more nuanced performance perspective, with identified challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

*Tolúl\d{o}pé Ògúnrèmí,Christopher D. Manning,Dan Jurafsky,Karen Livescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Modality adapters in spoken language models transform speech encoder outputs into representations for language models, using either meaning-based English interlingua or phonetic representations depending on the speech encoder's training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how modality adapters transform speech representations in spoken language models, as these crucial components bridge speech encoders with language models but their transformation strategies are poorly understood.

Method: Examined MA output representations in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio, Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct) by finding the nearest decoder LM token to MA representations.

Result: Found two strategies: models with Whisper encoder use English-based interlingua representing meaning, while others like Phi-4 use phonetic representations expressed with English words. Whisper-based models can handle languages unseen in instruction tuning.

Conclusion: The transformation strategy depends on whether the speech encoder is trained only for speech recognition or also for translation, with Whisper-based encoders enabling cross-lingual capability through meaning-based representations.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

### [45] [Evaluation Framework for Highlight Explanations of Context Utilisation in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02629)
*Jingyi Sun,Pepa Atanasova,Sagnik Ray Choudhury,Sekh Mainul Islam,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first gold standard evaluation framework for highlight explanations (HEs) in context attribution, assessing four HE methods across various scenarios, datasets, and language models to determine their accuracy in explaining how models utilize context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models lack transparency in context utilization, making it difficult for users to determine whether responses are based on parametric memory or provided context, and which specific context pieces inform the generation.

Method: The authors developed a gold standard HE evaluation framework using controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage. They evaluated four HE methods (three established techniques and MechLight, their adapted mechanistic interpretability approach) across four context scenarios, four datasets, and five language models.

Result: MechLight performed best across all context scenarios, but all methods struggled with longer contexts and exhibited positional biases, revealing fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy.

Conclusion: Current highlight explanation methods have limitations in providing reliable context utilization explanations at scale, particularly with longer contexts, indicating the need for new approaches to address these fundamental accuracy challenges.

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

### [46] [Mind the Gap: Linguistic Divergence and Adaptation Strategies in Human-LLM Assistant vs. Human-Human Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02645)
*Fulei Zhang,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Users communicate differently with LLM chatbots vs human agents, showing differences in grammar, politeness, and vocabulary. Models trained only on human-human data may not handle this style shift, but data augmentation helps improve model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users' communication styles differ between LLM chatbots and human agents, and address the gap where models trained on human-human data may not accommodate post-deployment style changes.

Method: Analyzed user communication patterns, then tested two strategies: (1) data augmentation during post-training with stylistically diverse datasets, and (2) inference-time user message reformulation.

Result: Found significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical diversity between chatbot and human interactions. Models trained on stylistically diverse datasets significantly outperformed those trained on original or uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation was less effective.

Conclusion: Data augmentation with stylistically diverse training data is crucial for improving LLM robustness to accommodate the communication style shifts that occur when users interact with chatbots versus human agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

*Rui Qi,Zhibo Man,Yufeng Chen,Fengran Mo,Jinan Xu,Kaiyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SoT is a training-free method that improves multilingual reasoning by converting language-specific semantics into language-agnostic structured representations through multi-step transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with multilingual reasoning tasks due to resource constraints, as reasoning capacity hasn't been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages.

Method: Proposes Structured-of-Thought (SoT) with two transformations: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation, converting semantic information into structured representations.

Result: SoT outperforms strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks across various LLM backbones and can integrate with other training-free strategies.

Conclusion: SoT effectively enables LLMs to handle cross-lingual reasoning by maintaining consistent reasoning pathways through structured representations.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), covering data collection, organization, model optimization methods, evaluations, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend self-improvement techniques from LLMs to the multimodal domain to leverage diverse data sources and develop more general self-improving models.

Method: Structured analysis from three perspectives: data collection, data organization, and model optimization, plus evaluations and downstream applications.

Result: A comprehensive survey that organizes current literature and provides a framework for understanding self-improvement methods in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future research directions for advancing self-improvement in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,
particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively
young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data
collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the
further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open
challenges and future research directions.

*Yavuz Bakman,Sungmin Kang,Zhiqi Huang,Duygu Nur Yaldiz,Catarina G. Belém,Chenyang Zhu,Anoop Kumar,Alfy Samuel,Salman Avestimehr,Daben Liu,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel uncertainty quantification method for contextual question answering that measures epistemic uncertainty by comparing model predictions against an idealized model, focusing on three key semantic features: context-reliance, context comprehension, and honesty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty quantification research has focused on closed-book factual QA while ignoring contextual QA, despite its importance in real-world applications where models need to assess their confidence when answering questions based on provided context.

Method: The authors introduce a token-level uncertainty measure based on cross-entropy between model predictions and true distribution, decompose it to isolate epistemic uncertainty, and approximate the true distribution using an idealized model. They identify three semantic features (context-reliance, context comprehension, honesty) that approximate the gap between given model and ideal model, and use ensemble methods with minimal labeled data to form robust uncertainty scores.

Result: Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show the method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to 13-point PRR improvement with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed theoretically grounded approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty in contextual QA by identifying semantic feature gaps between models, providing a practical and efficient solution that significantly advances uncertainty quantification for real-world applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

*Yubo Li,Ramayya Krishnan,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survival analysis reveals that abrupt semantic drift causes catastrophic conversational failure in LLMs, while gradual drift protects against failure and enables longer dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks fail to capture temporal dynamics of conversational degradation in multi-turn dialogues, leaving LLM robustness in extended conversations poorly understood.

Method: Comprehensive survival analysis of 36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs using Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest approaches to model failure as time-to-event process.

Result: Abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift dramatically increases failure hazard, while gradual cumulative drift significantly reduces failure hazard and enables longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions showed superior performance with excellent discrimination and calibration.

Conclusion: Survival analysis is a powerful paradigm for evaluating LLM robustness, offering insights for designing resilient conversational agents and challenging assumptions about semantic consistency necessity in conversational AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

*Srinivas Billa,Xiaonan Jing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing LLM benchmarks fail to capture model capabilities in low-resource tasks. The authors created 14 travel-domain datasets from real-world data and found that general benchmarks are insufficient for understanding performance in domain-specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks provide little information about model capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective solutions in these domains.

Method: Curated 14 travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from real-world scenarios, and analyzed performance across LLMs including accuracy, scaling behavior, and reasoning capabilities.

Result: General benchmarking results are insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks in complex, domain-specific scenarios regardless of training FLOPs. Reasoning provides more significant performance boost for smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Domain-specific evaluation is crucial for understanding LLM capabilities in low-resource scenarios, and reasoning capabilities are particularly beneficial for smaller models in certain tasks.

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

*KM Pooja,Cheng Long,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PGMEL is a generative adversarial network that uses policy gradient techniques to generate high-quality negative samples for multimodal entity linking, improving representation learning and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal entity linking methods don't explore the potential of high-quality negative sample selection for metric learning, which could significantly improve performance.

Method: Proposed PGMEL - a generative adversarial network where generator creates challenging negative samples using policy gradient optimization (for discrete generation), while discriminator performs metric learning tasks.

Result: PGMEL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets by learning more meaningful representations through challenging negative samples.

Conclusion: Generative adversarial approach with policy gradient optimization effectively addresses negative sample selection in multimodal entity linking, leading to improved performance.

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Santhosh G S,Akshay Govind S,Gokul S Krishnan,Balaraman Ravindran,Sriraam Natarajan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contrastive learning-based evaluation framework and IndiCASA dataset to assess cultural biases in LLMs, finding all tested models exhibit stereotypical biases with disability bias being most persistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes applications but existing bias assessment methods fall short in capturing nuanced cultural stereotypes, particularly in diverse contexts like India.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework using contrastive learning-trained encoder to measure embedding similarity, and created IndiCASA dataset with 2,575 human-validated sentences across five demographic axes.

Result: All evaluated open-weight LLMs showed stereotypical bias, with disability bias being most persistent and religion bias generally lower, likely due to global debiasing efforts.

Conclusion: There is a demonstrated need for fairer model development as current LLMs exhibit cultural biases that existing assessment methods may not adequately capture.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

TL;DR: Self-aware reinforcement learning for LLMs that alternates between proposing and solving tasks, using difficulty prediction and limit breaking mechanisms to minimize data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL training for LLMs requires substantial data annotation efforts, so this work explores improving LLMs through RL with minimal data.

Method: Alternates between LLM proposing tasks and solving them, with self-aware difficulty prediction to prioritize challenging but solvable tasks, and self-aware limit breaking to request external data when tasks exceed capabilities.

Result: 53.8% relative improvement on nine benchmarks with less than 1.2% extra data compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Self-aware RL is effective for LLM improvement with minimal data and shows promise for self-evolving agent training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

*Tien Phat Nguyen,Vu Minh Ngo,Tung Nguyen,Linh Van Ngo,Duc Anh Nguyen,Sang Dinh,Trung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XTRA is a cross-lingual topic modeling framework that combines Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual embeddings through representation and topic alignments to achieve better topic coherence, diversity, and cross-lingual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous cross-lingual topic modeling methods struggle with ensuring high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages, despite some improvements in topic diversity.

Method: XTRA uses two core components: representation alignment (aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning) and topic alignment (projecting topic-word distributions into shared semantic space). It unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual embeddings.

Result: Experiments on multilingual corpora show XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity, and alignment quality.

Conclusion: XTRA successfully learns interpretable topics that are both coherent and diverse while maintaining good cross-lingual alignment through its dual alignment mechanism.

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

### [56] [A Computational Framework for Interpretable Text-Based Personality Assessment from Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02811)
*Matej Gjurković*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This thesis addresses challenges in automated personality assessment from social media text by introducing two large datasets (MBTI9k and PANDORA) and developing the SIMPA framework for interpretable personality assessment using semantic similarity matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing availability of digital footprints from social media creates opportunities for automated personality assessment, but challenges include scarcity of large personality-labeled datasets and disconnect between personality psychology and NLP, limiting model validity and interpretability.

Method: Created two Reddit-based datasets (MBTI9k and PANDORA) with personality labels and demographic information. Developed SIMPA framework that uses machine learning and semantic similarity to match user-generated statements with validated questionnaire items for interpretable personality assessment.

Result: Experiments showed demographic variables influence model validity. SIMPA achieved personality assessments comparable to human evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. The framework proved versatile beyond personality assessment due to its model-agnostic design and scalability.

Conclusion: The SIMPA framework successfully addresses key challenges in automated personality assessment by providing interpretable results through semantic matching, with potential applications extending to other domains with complex label taxonomies.

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG introduces a framework combining question decomposition with BFS reasoning flow for multi-hop QA, achieving state-of-the-art performance while improving explainability through explicit evidence chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge retrieval in retrieval-augmented generation for multi-hop question answering.

Method: Builds global corpus index, parses retrieved passages into knowledge graph, splits complex queries into sub-questions, and uses BFS-based traversal to expand along relevant edges while assembling explicit evidence chains.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1 scores on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA, with average EM improvement of 2.57% and F1 improvement of 2.13% over SOTA, largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).

Conclusion: Framework enhances explainability through chain-of-thought preservation, with future work needed to address computational overhead and potential LLM hallucinations for improved efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

### [58] [Evaluating Large Language Models for IUCN Red List Species Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02830)
*Shinya Uryu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show strong performance in taxonomic classification (94.9%) but poor conservation reasoning (27.2%), revealing a knowledge-reasoning gap that limits their reliability for species evaluation without human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically validate the reliability of LLMs for species evaluation in conservation, given their rapid adoption despite uncertainty about their capabilities.

Method: Systematic validation of five leading LLM models on 21,955 species across four IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy, conservation status, distribution, and threats.

Result: Models excelled at taxonomic classification but consistently failed at conservation reasoning, showing systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates and revealing inherent architectural constraints.

Conclusion: LLMs are powerful for information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions; a hybrid approach is recommended where LLMs augment expert capacity while humans retain authority over risk assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

*Jahidul Arafat,Fariha Tasmin,Sanjaya Poudel,Kamrujjaman,Eftakhar Ahmed Arnob,Ahsan Habib Tareq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies, achieving significant improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Wordle solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, creating a need for principled constraint satisfaction approaches.

Method: Introduces CSP-Aware Entropy (computing information gain after constraint propagation) and Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints.

Result: CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking with 46% faster runtime. Maintains advantages under noise and achieves 100% success across all noise levels with Probabilistic CSP.

Conclusion: Principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains, with core CSP principles transferring across languages without language-specific tuning.

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

### [60] [Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02919)
*Jian Mu,Qixin Zhang,Zhiyong Wang,Menglin Yang,Shuang Qiu,Chengwei Qin,Zhongxiang Dai,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRGen is a test-time framework that enables LLMs to self-reflect during generation by identifying uncertain tokens and applying corrective vectors, improving reasoning accuracy without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM self-reflection methods are either reactive (full draft revisions) or require expensive training, making them inefficient for real-time error correction during generation.

Method: Uses dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens during generation, then trains specific corrective vectors that exploit generated context to correct token probability distributions through self-reflective analysis.

Result: Significantly improves reasoning performance on mathematical benchmarks, with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B showing +12.0% Pass@1 and +13.3% Cons@5 improvements on AIME2024.

Conclusion: SRGen provides a plug-and-play method for integrating reflection into generation, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CDR, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating conversational data retrieval systems, revealing significant performance gaps between document and conversational retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable evaluation standards for systems that retrieve conversation data for product insights, as existing benchmarks don't adequately address the unique challenges of conversational data.

Method: Created the CDR benchmark with 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k conversations, then evaluated 16 popular embedding models on this benchmark.

Result: Even the best models achieved only around NDCG@10 of 0.51, showing a substantial performance gap between document and conversational data retrieval. The benchmark identified unique challenges including implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, and contextual references.

Conclusion: The CDR benchmark provides a reliable standard for measuring conversational data retrieval performance and reveals significant room for improvement in current retrieval models for conversational data.

Abstract: We present the Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark, the first
comprehensive test set for evaluating systems that retrieve conversation data
for product insights. With 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k
conversations, our benchmark provides a reliable standard for measuring
conversational data retrieval performance. Our evaluation of 16 popular
embedding models shows that even the best models reach only around NDCG@10 of
0.51, revealing a substantial gap between document and conversational data
retrieval capabilities. Our work identifies unique challenges in conversational
data retrieval (implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, contextual
references) while providing practical query templates and detailed error

*Jingqi Zhang,Ruibo Chen,Yingqing Yang,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang,Yan Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a black-box framework for detecting copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning through distortion-free watermarks and entropy-gated detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable safeguards against unauthorized use of proprietary/copyrighted material in LLM fine-tuning, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require internal signals or clean reference datasets.

Method: Rewrites datasets with distortion-free watermarks using private key, exploits radioactivity effect of fine-tuning, and uses entropy-gated procedure to selectively score high-uncertainty tokens.

Result: Achieves significant detections (p<0.05) across diverse datasets and model families, supports multi-dataset attribution, and remains robust after continued pretraining on non-watermarked corpora.

Conclusion: TRACE provides practical black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage without degrading text quality or task performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

*Matthew Lewis,Samuel Thio,Richard JB Dobson,Spiros Denaxas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Developed a RAG system for querying UK NICE clinical guidelines using LLMs, achieving high retrieval performance (MRR 0.814, 99.1% recall in top 10) and significantly improving answer faithfulness by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extensive length and volume of NICE clinical guidelines impede their utilization in time-constrained healthcare systems, necessitating a system that can provide precisely matched information in response to natural language queries.

Method: Used a hybrid embedding mechanism retrieval architecture evaluated on 10,195 text chunks from 300 guidelines, with RAG-enhanced LLMs tested on 7,901 queries and a manually curated dataset of 70 question-answer pairs.

Result: High retrieval performance with MRR of 0.814, 81% recall at first chunk, 99.1% recall within top 10 chunks. RAG-enhanced models showed 64.7 percentage point improvement in faithfulness (reaching 99.5%) and perfect context precision of 1, significantly outperforming medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM (43% faithfulness).

Conclusion: RAG is an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines by preventing information fabrication through grounding answers in relevant source material.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

*Rongchen Guo,Vincent Francoeur,Isar Nejadgholi,Sylvain Gagnon,Miodrag Bolic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper distinguishes between descriptive and expressive semantics in speech emotion recognition, showing that descriptive semantics align with intended emotions while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy by addressing the complexity of emotional nuances in speech and distinguishing between contextual content and emotional expression.

Method: Recorded audio clips from participants describing their experiences after watching emotionally charged movie segments, collected intended emotion tags, self-rated emotional responses, and valence/arousal scores.

Result: Descriptive semantics align with intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.

Conclusion: The findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and enable more context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

### [65] [Revisiting Direct Speech-to-Text Translation with Speech LLMs: Better Scaling than CoT Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03093)
*Oriol Pareras,Gerard I. Gállego,Federico Costa,Cristina España-Bonet,Javier Hernando*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Direct prompting for Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) using LLM-based models, finding that Direct prompting improves more consistently with increasing data and may become more effective as S2TT resources grow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare CoT and Direct prompting strategies for S2TT under varying amounts of data, since CoT currently outperforms Direct primarily by leveraging abundant ASR and T2TT datasets.

Method: Pseudo-labeled an ASR corpus by translating transcriptions into six European languages, then trained LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting strategies at different data scales.

Result: Direct prompting improves more consistently as the amount of S2TT data increases, while CoT's advantage diminishes with more data.

Conclusion: Direct prompting may become a more effective approach than CoT as larger S2TT resources are created, due to its more consistent improvement with increasing data.

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

*Beth Pearson,Ahmed Adnan,Zahraa Abdallah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method combining Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to compare radiology reports, achieving 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/-1 compared to radiologist ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology report evaluation is crucial for radiologists' training and diagnostic accuracy. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and final reports helps junior doctors improve their clinical knowledge and reporting skills.

Method: Proposed Llama-EntScore method that combines Llama 3.1 with Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) using tunable weights to emphasize or de-emphasize specific types of differences. Generates quantitative similarity scores and interpretable feedback.

Result: Achieved 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/-1 when compared to radiologist-provided ground truth scores, outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

Conclusion: The proposed Llama-EntScore method effectively addresses limitations of standalone LLMs and NER approaches in radiology report comparison, providing accurate semantic similarity assessment with interpretable feedback for radiologist training.

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought prompting for Speech-to-Text Translation largely behaves like cascaded systems, relying mainly on transcripts rather than leveraging speech information, despite expectations to overcome error propagation and acoustic cue limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of cascaded S2TT systems (error propagation and inability to use acoustic cues) and evaluate whether Chain-of-Thought prompting can overcome these issues by jointly accessing speech and transcription.

Method: Analyzed CoT through attribution methods, robustness evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness tests. Also tested training interventions including adding Direct S2TT data and noisy transcript injection.

Result: CoT largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely leveraging speech. Training interventions enhanced robustness and increased speech attribution.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic information into translation.

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

TL;DR: SurveyBench is a quiz-driven evaluation framework that benchmarks LLM-generated surveys against human standards, revealing significant performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated survey generation methods (LLM4Survey) produce outputs that fall short of human quality, and there's a lack of rigorous benchmarks to systematically evaluate their deficiencies.

Method: Proposed SurveyBench framework with: (1) survey topics from 11,343 arXiv papers and 4,947 high-quality surveys, (2) multifaceted metric hierarchy assessing outline quality, content quality, and non-textual richness, (3) dual-mode evaluation protocol with content-based and quiz-based answerability tests.

Result: SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches, showing they perform on average 21% lower than human performance in content-based evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark successfully reveals deficiencies in automated survey generation and provides a rigorous evaluation framework aligned with readers' informational needs.

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

*Ej Zhou,Caiqi Zhang,Tiancheng Hu,Chengzu Li,Nigel Collier,Ivan Vulić,Anna Korhonen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals that non-English languages suffer from systematically worse calibration in LLMs due to English-centric training bias in final layers, and proposes training-free methods like LACE that use late-intermediate layers for better multilingual confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confidence calibration is crucial for reliable LLM deployment but remains under-explored in multilingual contexts, where non-English languages show systematically worse calibration due to English-centric training biases.

Method: Conducted large-scale multilingual calibration studies across 6 model families and 100+ languages, analyzed internal representations layer-wise, and introduced training-free methods including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE) that adaptively selects optimal layer ensembles per language.

Result: Found that final layers provide poor multilingual confidence signals due to English-centric bias, while late-intermediate layers offer more reliable and better-calibrated signals across languages.

Conclusion: The study highlights hidden costs of English-centric alignment and provides a path toward more globally equitable LLMs by leveraging intermediate layers rather than final layers for multilingual confidence calibration.

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EditLens, a method to detect AI-edited text by using similarity metrics as supervision and training a regression model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While previous work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, this paper addresses the gap in detecting AI-edited text, which is a common use case where users ask LLMs to edit their human-written text rather than generate from scratch.

Method: Proposes lightweight similarity metrics to quantify AI editing magnitude, validates these with human annotators, then uses them as intermediate supervision to train EditLens - a regression model that predicts the amount of AI editing in text.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with F1=94.7% on binary classification and F1=90.4% on ternary classification tasks. Successfully demonstrates detection of AI-edited text and the degree of AI changes to human writing.

Conclusion: AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text, with implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. The model is applied to analyze Grammarly edits, and the authors commit to publicly releasing models and dataset.

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

TL;DR: This study validates previous findings about correlations between LLM hidden states and fMRI brain responses by addressing four methodological concerns: dimensionality reduction, similarity measures, language-specific training, and positional encoding effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the robustness of previous findings showing correlations between large language model hidden states and fMRI brain responses, addressing potential methodological concerns in the literature.

Method: The study systematically tests four potential concerns: (i) applying dimensionality reduction to address curse of dimensionality, (ii) using new similarity measures, (iii) comparing models trained on human language vs. other data, and (iv) examining the role of positional encoding in models.

Result: The correlations between brain representations and model representations are confirmed to be robust across all tested concerns - they persist after dimensionality reduction, hold with new similarity measures, are specific to models trained on human language, and depend on positional encoding.

Conclusion: The results strengthen evidence for representational similarity between LLMs and brain states, supporting the biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art language models.

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

### [72] [Topic Modeling as Long-Form Generation: Can Long-Context LLMs revolutionize NTM via Zero-Shot Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03174)
*Xuan Xu,Haolun Li,Zhongliang Yang,Beilin Chu,Jia Song,Moxuan Xu,Linna Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new paradigm for topic modeling using large language models (LLMs) instead of traditional neural topic models (NTMs), framing topic modeling as a long-form generation task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can outperform traditional neural topic models and investigate the claim that most NTMs are outdated in the era of large language models.

Method: A simple approach using LLMs: sample data subsets, generate topics and representative text with prompts, and assign text using keyword matching. Comparison is done via zero-shot prompting.

Result: Systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of topic quality, examining whether LLMs can beat NTMs through zero-shot prompting.

Conclusion: The paper investigates the viability of using LLMs as a new paradigm for topic modeling and tests whether this approach makes traditional neural topic models outdated.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

### [73] [Model-Based Ranking of Source Languages for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03202)
*Abteen Ebrahimi,Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NN-Rank is a novel algorithm that ranks source languages for cross-lingual transfer using multilingual model representations and unlabeled target-language data, outperforming existing methods on POS and NER tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-lingual transfer by developing a more effective method for ranking source languages that doesn't rely on lexical or linguistic features, using only unlabeled target data and multilingual model representations.

Method: Leverages hidden representations from pretrained multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data to rank source languages for cross-lingual transfer, tested on 51 source languages and evaluated on 56-72 target languages for POS and NER tasks.

Result: NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and 18.14 NDCG for NER when using in-domain data, and remains competitive using only out-of-domain Bible corpus. Works well even with as few as 25 examples, achieving 92.8% of full-data NDCG.

Conclusion: NN-Rank provides an effective and data-efficient approach for source language ranking in cross-lingual transfer, outperforming feature-based methods and working well with minimal unlabeled target data.

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FocusAgent uses a lightweight LLM retriever to extract relevant lines from web page accessibility trees, reducing observation size by over 50% while maintaining performance and improving security against prompt injection attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents face challenges with lengthy web page observations that exceed context limits, increase computational costs, and expose agents to security risks like prompt injection. Existing pruning methods either remove relevant content or keep irrelevant context.

Method: Leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. This prunes noisy and irrelevant content while enabling efficient reasoning.

Result: On WorkArena and WebArena benchmarks, FocusAgent matches baseline performance while reducing observation size by over 50%. A variant significantly reduces success rate of prompt-injection attacks (including banner and pop-up attacks) while maintaining task success in attack-free settings.

Conclusion: Targeted LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents that are efficient, effective, and secure.

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

### [75] [Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03215)
*Tianyu Fu,Zihan Min,Hanling Zhang,Jichao Yan,Guohao Dai,Wanli Ouyang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cache-to-Cache (C2C) enables direct semantic communication between LLMs using KV-cache projection and fusion, avoiding text generation bottlenecks and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based communication between LLMs loses semantic information and causes latency. KV-cache can serve as a more effective medium for inter-model communication.

Method: C2C uses neural networks to project and fuse source model's KV-cache with target model's KV-cache, with learnable gating to select beneficial layers.

Result: C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher accuracy than individual models and 3.0-5.0% improvement over text communication, with 2.0x speedup in latency.

Conclusion: Direct KV-cache communication outperforms text-based approaches in both performance and efficiency for multi-LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

*Hongxiang Zhang,Yuan Tian,Tianyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Anchor is a novel prompting method that structures reasoning trajectories to maintain LLM attention on critical steps, outperforming SOTA methods across six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As reasoning chains extend in LLMs, critical intermediate steps and original prompts get buried in context, receiving insufficient attention and causing errors.

Method: Decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns model attention to the most relevant inference steps to maintain focus throughout generation.

Result: Outperforms SOTA prompting methods across six benchmarks and significantly reduces performance gap between non-reasoning and specialized reasoning models.

Conclusion: Self-Anchor has the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks without retraining by maintaining attention on critical reasoning steps.

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

*Sebastian Gehrmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reward models and evaluation metrics share common challenges but are studied separately, leading to redundant work. Closer collaboration between these fields can help overcome issues like spurious correlations and reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of LLMs has increased interest in reward models, but this research area is separate from evaluation metrics, causing redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls.

Method: The paper provides an extensive survey of both reward models and evaluation metrics, comparing their performance on specific tasks and identifying common challenges.

Result: The analysis shows that metrics can outperform reward models on specific tasks, and reveals shared challenges including susceptibility to spurious correlations, reward hacking, data quality issues, and meta-evaluation methods.

Conclusion: Closer collaboration between reward models and evaluation metrics research can improve both areas through better preference elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Oracle-RLAIF is a novel framework that replaces trained reward models with a general Oracle ranker and introduces a rank-based loss function to optimize video-language models more efficiently using ordinal feedback rather than scalar scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF) frameworks require expensive specialized reward models trained with video narratives, making fine-tuning large video-language models costly and restrictive.

Method: Proposes Oracle-RLAIF framework using a general Oracle ranker instead of trained reward models, and introduces $GRPO_{rank}$ - a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy Optimization that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages.

Result: Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading video-language models using existing fine-tuning methods across various video comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF enables flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models using reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR is a unified framework that learns a visual-to-action policy for physically plausible human motion reconstruction from monocular videos, avoiding the error accumulation of traditional two-stage approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use kinematics-based pose estimation followed by physics-based post-processing, which leads to error accumulation and unrealistic results due to lack of physical constraints.

Method: Uses a unified framework with pixel-as-ray strategy to lift 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays, combined with local visual features. Employs distillation from mocap-trained expert and reinforcement learning with physical rewards.

Result: Produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios, outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Conclusion: PhysHMR successfully enables motion reconstruction that is both physically grounded and visually aligned with input video through a unified visual-to-action policy approach.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-machine collaboration in face identification follows the Proximal Accuracy Rule - collaboration benefits increase when baseline accuracy differences between collaborators decrease. Intelligent fusion of humans and machines can improve accuracy beyond either alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when combining human and machine decisions in face identification improves accuracy, given that individual differences affect whether collaboration helps or harms performance.

Method: Used data from expert and non-expert face identifiers to examine human-human and human-machine collaborations. Applied Proximal Accuracy Rule to predict collaborative benefits across different baseline abilities. Implemented intelligent human-machine fusion by selecting people who could improve machine accuracy.

Result: Found a surprisingly large critical fusion zone where humans are less accurate than machines but fusing improves system accuracy. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than machines alone or combining all human-machine judgments. Human-only partnerships achieved similar average performance but intelligent human-machine collaboration better minimized low-performer impact.

Conclusion: Both humans and machines play meaningful roles in accurate face identification. The study provides an evidence-based roadmap for intelligent AI use in face identification systems.

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First framework for uncertainty quantification in generative video models, addressing safety concerns about video hallucinations through a novel metric and black-box method called S-QUBED that decomposes uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models hallucinate like LLMs, producing plausible but factually wrong videos, creating critical safety concerns. No existing uncertainty quantification methods exist for video models despite extensive UQ research for LLMs.

Method: Proposed framework includes: (i) calibration metric based on robust rank correlation estimation, (ii) S-QUBED black-box UQ method using latent modeling to decompose uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components, (iii) UQ dataset for benchmarking. Latent space conditioning disentangles uncertainty from vague task specifications vs. lack of knowledge.

Result: S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with task accuracy and effectively separates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first uncertainty quantification framework for generative video models, providing essential safety tools to address hallucination issues and enabling reliable deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEO is a training-free method that optimizes text embeddings in pre-trained diffusion models to improve aesthetic quality of generated images from simple prompts, using a tripartite objective function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance visual quality of images generated from simple, uncurated prompts in text-to-image diffusion models without requiring additional training.

Method: Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO) - optimizes text embeddings using a tripartite objective function that improves aesthetic quality, maintains embedding adherence, and preserves original prompt meaning through a preservation term.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show PEO exceeds or equals state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt adaptation methods in performance.

Conclusion: PEO effectively improves aesthetic quality in diffusion models while being training-free and backbone-independent, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D hand tracking datasets are predominantly captured in controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model generalization for real-world applications.

Method: Developed a lightweight back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras and a Meta Quest 3 headset providing two egocentric views, with an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground truth.

Result: Created an annotated dataset with synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand poses, demonstrating significant reduction in the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables accurate 3D hand tracking in genuinely in-the-wild conditions, overcoming limitations of previous controlled lab setups.

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a distillation method to convert slow many-step diffusion models for co-speech video generation into fast few-step models that achieve real-time performance while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for co-speech video synthesis are too slow for real-time applications due to numerous denoising steps and expensive attention mechanisms.

Method: The method distills a many-step diffusion model into a few-step student model using input human pose conditioning for attention and loss functions. It introduces input-aware sparse attention guided by pose keypoints and an input-aware distillation loss for better lip sync and hand motion.

Result: The approach achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods, demonstrating effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: By leveraging input-aware conditioning for attention and loss functions, the method successfully enables real-time co-speech video generation while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunLoRA: A novel functional LoRA method for continual adaptation of generative models that prevents catastrophic forgetting using rank-1 matrices with dynamic conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal memory and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual adaptation of deep generative models, which is critical for text and vision applications. Current approaches face intractable training time increases and performance degradation from synthetic data reliance.

Method: Proposes functional LoRA (FunLoRA) - an expressive conditioning mechanism using rank-1 matrices with functional rank increase through carefully selected functions. The model is trained only on current task data with dynamic conditioning to prevent forgetting.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art diffusion models in classification accuracy while requiring only a fraction of memory cost and sampling time. Extensive experiments with flow-matching models show superior performance.

Conclusion: FunLoRA provides an effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for continual learning that avoids catastrophic forgetting, reduces computational overhead, and maintains high performance without reliance on synthetic data.

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual field-of-view, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic light and sign recognition in autonomous vehicles, addressing vulnerabilities to both digital and natural perturbations through a unified three-layer defense stack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic light and sign recognition is crucial for autonomous vehicle safety, but current models are vulnerable to both digital adversarial attacks and natural perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, graffiti), lacking consideration of temporal continuity and multistatic field-of-view sensing.

Method: Proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework using a multi-source dataset from aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded Texas videos. Uses mid and long-term RGB sequences aligned for four operational domains. Implements a unified three-layer defense stack with feature squeezing, defensive distillation, entropy-based anomaly detection, and sequence-wise temporal voting.

Result: The Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP and reduced attack success rate to 18.2%, outperforming YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer. Reduced high-risk misclassification to 32%. Physical transferability confirmed using recapture probes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances robustness in traffic light and sign recognition for autonomous vehicles, addressing both digital and natural perturbations through temporal sequence preservation and multi-layer defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO is a novel method that optimizes noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models, improving reward optimization and visual quality through iterative search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models are deterministic and poorly suited for reinforcement learning, which is crucial for improving image quality and human alignment. Existing stochasticity methods using random noise perturbations are inefficient and unstable.

Method: Smart-GRPO employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations, evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution toward higher-reward regions.

Result: Experiments show Smart-GRPO improves both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Smart-GRPO provides a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

TL;DR: FSFSplatter enables fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images using dense Gaussian initialization and geometry-enhanced optimization, outperforming SOTA methods on DTU and Replica datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods require dense, calibrated views and perform poorly with free sparse images due to limited overlap and overfitting issues.

Method: Integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization using large Transformer, self-splitting Gaussian head, contribution-based pruning, and depth/multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during optimization.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica datasets.

Conclusion: FSFSplatter successfully addresses the challenges of sparse image reconstruction by combining dense initialization with geometry-aware optimization, achieving superior surface reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC is a unified framework that integrates intention modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis, addressing limitations in existing text-driven motion generation methods by capturing causal logic and human intentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven motion generation methods are limited in capturing causal logic of action execution and human intentions, and lack visual grounding which restricts precision and personalization.

Method: Jointly optimizes multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction, uses mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope for local alignment, and leverages visual priors. Built on Mo440H benchmark with 440 hours of motion data.

Result: Reduces FID by 38.6% on HumanML3D and 34.6% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based methods in motion captioning, and enables intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: MoGIC advances controllable motion synthesis and intention understanding by integrating intention modeling and visual priors into a unified multimodal framework.

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

*Jianing Chen,Zehao Li,Yujun Cai,Hao Jiang,Shuqin Gao,Honglong Zhao,Tianlu Mao,Yucheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-adaptive 3D reconstruction framework that aligns control point density with motion complexity using semantic/motion priors and spline-based trajectories, improving reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse control methods for dynamic 3D reconstruction suffer from static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency due to geometry-only point allocation, creating a mismatch between control density and motion complexity.

Method: Uses vision foundation models to establish patch-token-node correspondences, applies motion-adaptive compression with iterative voxelization and motion tendency scoring, and introduces spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets.

Result: Significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods, with better motion representation and more stable optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed motion-adaptive framework successfully addresses the fundamental mismatch in control point allocation, achieving superior dynamic 3D reconstruction through adaptive density and improved temporal modeling.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Net2Net is a hybrid denoising method that combines untrained and pre-trained networks using regularization by denoising (RED) to address real-world noise removal challenges without requiring extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional denoising methods rely on handcrafted priors and struggle with real noise complexity, while deep learning approaches need large labeled datasets and may not generalize well across diverse noise types and imaging conditions.

Method: Combines unsupervised Deep Image Prior (DIP) with supervised pre-trained DRUNet model using regularization by denoising (RED), allowing the untrained network to adapt to unique noise characteristics while leveraging learned representations from large datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance for real-world noise removal, with improved generalization across varying noise patterns and better performance in limited training data scenarios.

Conclusion: The Net2Net hybrid framework effectively addresses real-world denoising challenges by combining the strengths of both untrained and pre-trained networks, providing robust performance without requiring extensive labeled data.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1 is the first R1-style MLLM for multimodal universal retrieval that uses step-by-step reasoning to achieve higher performance, addressing computational cost and training instability issues through information compression and a new training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities for retrieval tasks by adapting DeepSeek-R1's RL approach, while overcoming the high computational cost and instability issues when directly applying RL to retrieval.

Method: Introduces an information compression module with details inspection mechanism to reduce token consumption, and a new training paradigm with activation stage using retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset followed by RL with curriculum reward.

Result: Retrv-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address the challenges of applying RL to retrieval tasks, demonstrating that step-by-step reasoning can significantly improve multimodal retrieval performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCA+ is a training-free test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models that uses Bayesian inference with dynamic caching of class embeddings, spatial scales, and adaptive priors to improve object recognition and detection under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation or focus only on likelihood adaptation while ignoring the important role of class priors, limiting real-time deployment and performance.

Method: BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales for detection, and adaptive class priors from historical predictions. It formulates adaptation as Bayesian inference, fusing initial VLM outputs with cache-based predictions that combine updated likelihoods and evolving priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: BCA+ provides an efficient, training-free framework that successfully adapts vision-language models during inference by incorporating both likelihood and prior adaptation through Bayesian inference, enabling better performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGCD-BT is a hierarchical generalized category discovery method for brain tumor classification that identifies both known and unknown tumor types using contrastive learning and hierarchical clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain tumor classification methods are limited to predefined classes and cannot identify new tumor types not seen during training, which is critical for intra-operative decision making in neurosurgery.

Method: Integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning, extending GCD with a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss to capture the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies.

Result: Achieves +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification on OpenSRH dataset, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Also generalizes to slide-level classification on Digital Brain Tumor Atlas.

Conclusion: HGCD-BT effectively bridges the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning for brain tumor classification, enabling discovery of both known and unknown tumor types across different imaging modalities.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key is a training-free keyframe sampling module for long-form video understanding that maximizes a unified Relevance-Diversity objective to select informative yet non-redundant frames, with adaptive gating for weak alignment cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with long-form videos due to uniform sampling missing critical moments, while existing keyframe selection methods either impose rigid temporal spacing that misses fine-grained cues or emphasize diversity but neglect query relevance.

Method: Proposes AdaRD-Key that maximizes a unified Relevance-Diversity Max-Volume objective combining query-conditioned relevance scores with log-determinant diversity. Includes lightweight relevance-aware gating that shifts to diversity-only mode when weak alignment is detected.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks, particularly for long-form videos. Runs in real time on a single GPU and is plug-and-play compatible with existing VLMs.

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key provides an effective, training-free solution for query-driven long-form video understanding by balancing relevance and diversity in keyframe selection, with adaptive handling of weak alignment scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex lateral thinking challenges like rebus puzzles, but the underlying reasoning processes and failure patterns remain largely unexplored.

Method: Created a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories, with an evaluation framework separating reasoning quality from answer correctness. Investigated three prompting strategies to elicit different explanatory processes.

Result: Reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle categories - models show systematic strengths in visual composition but fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. Prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explainability should be an integral component of model performance rather than a post-hoc consideration, as it reveals critical insights into VLM cognitive processes.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new synthetic dataset for text removal that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by using complex backgrounds and vision-language models to create challenging scenarios with clean ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text removal datasets have issues with ground truth artifacts from manual editing, simplistic backgrounds, and inadequate evaluation metrics, limiting out-of-domain generalization and accurate assessment of text removal methods.

Method: The authors developed a synthetic text removal benchmark using object-aware text placement on complex backgrounds and vision-language model-generated content to ensure clean ground truth and challenging removal scenarios.

Result: A new dataset called OTR was created that features text rendered on complex backgrounds with clean ground truth, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks like SCUT-EnsText.

Conclusion: The proposed synthetic dataset provides a more robust benchmark for evaluating text removal methods across different domains beyond scene text, with improved ground truth quality and challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical object detection suffers when trained on mixed modalities due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces, requiring representation alignment to create a shared feature space.

Method: Proposes modality tokens (text-derived embeddings encoding imaging modality) integrated via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) to propagate modality context within object queries, plus QueryREPA pretraining using contrastive learning to align queries with modality tokens.

Result: Consistently improves AP across diverse medical modalities with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, producing modality-aware queries that transfer effectively to downstream training.

Conclusion: Offers a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection by aligning object query representations with modality context through lightweight, detector-agnostic framework.

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

### [100] [MaskCD: Mitigating LVLM Hallucinations by Image Head Masked Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02790)
*Jingyuan Deng,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskCD uses image head masking to create contrastive samples for reducing hallucinations in large vision-language models while preserving their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing hallucinations in LVLMs have limitations - contrastive decoding struggles with sample construction and attention manipulation lacks stability.

Method: Proposes image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD) that masks image heads in LVLMs to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding.

Result: Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b using benchmarks like CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME, showing effective hallucination reduction while maintaining general model capabilities.

Conclusion: MaskCD successfully alleviates hallucinations in LVLMs and preserves their overall performance, providing a stable solution to the hallucination problem.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

TL;DR: VERNIER is an open source phase processing software that provides fast and reliable pose measurement using pseudo-periodic patterns, achieving nanometric and microradian resolutions for microscopy applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation at small scales remains challenging, with few solutions available for capturing 6 degrees of freedom with nanometric and microradian resolutions over large ranges.

Method: Uses phase-based processing of pseudo-periodic patterns with a phase-based local thresholding algorithm, making it robust to noise, defocus and occlusion.

Result: The software achieves reliable performance for various microscopy applications, enabling centimeter ranges with pattern encoding and nanometer resolutions with phase processing.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for selecting appropriate pattern designs and microscope magnification lenses based on desired performance requirements.

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

*Feng Yuan,Yifan Gao,Yuehua Ye,Haoyue Li,Xin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-K2N addresses K to N medical image synthesis by modeling heterogeneous modality contributions, ensuring fusion quality control, and maintaining modality identity consistency through sequential frame processing and adaptive weighting mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical need for flexible modality reconstruction where missing imaging modalities must be synthesized from available ones to support diagnosis, addressing challenges in modeling modality contributions, fusion quality control, and modality identity consistency.

Method: Treats multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with quality-driven selection. Uses three modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation. Includes Causal Modality Identity Module (CMIM) for modality identity consistency through vision-language modeling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Med-K2N framework effectively addresses K to N medical image synthesis challenges through adaptive weighting, quality control mechanisms, and modality identity preservation, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELMF4EggQ is an ensemble learning framework that uses multimodal feature fusion (image, shape, weight) to classify egg grade and freshness non-destructively, achieving 86.57% accuracy for grade classification and 70.83% for freshness prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for food safety, product standards, and operational efficiency in commercial poultry production. Current methods often require invasive internal measurements.

Method: Uses ensemble learning with multimodal feature fusion combining deep features from external egg images (ResNet152, DenseNet169, ResNet152V2) with structural characteristics (shape, weight). Includes PCA dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and ensemble voting from multiple ML classifiers.

Result: The multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular-only baselines, achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction. A novel public dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs with expert-assessed quality labels was created.

Conclusion: This is the first study to apply machine learning for internal egg quality assessment using only external features, demonstrating that multimodal ensemble learning can effectively predict internal egg quality non-destructively. All code and data are publicly available to promote reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-ioner is a zero-shot captioning framework that shifts from image-centric to patch-centric paradigm, enabling captioning of arbitrary regions without region-level supervision by treating patches as atomic captioning units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot captioners are limited to global image representations and whole-image captions, lacking the ability to caption arbitrary regions without paired image-text data.

Method: Treats individual patches as atomic captioning units and aggregates them to describe arbitrary regions (single patches, non-contiguous areas, entire images) using dense visual features from backbones like DINO.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot dense, region-set, and trace captioning tasks, demonstrating better performance than baselines and competitors.

Conclusion: Patch-wise semantic representations are effective for scalable caption generation, with meaningful dense visual features being key to success in region-based captioning tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether foundation models fine-tuned for segmentation can inherently detect out-of-distribution regions without outlier supervision, proposing a simple training-free method using InternImage features with K-Means clustering and confidence thresholding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, but the capability of large vision foundation models to detect out-of-distribution regions remains underexplored.

Method: A training-free approach that utilizes features from InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters.

Result: Achieves 50.02 Average Precision on RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on ADE-OoD benchmark with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: The results suggest a promising direction for generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional data.

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV is a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for MLLMs that addresses limitations of attention-first pruning approaches by distributing pruning budgets across spatial crops to maintain global visual context and prevent representational collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from computational overhead due to massive visual tokens. Attention-first pruning methods preserve semantically similar tokens, causing performance drops at high pruning ratios.

Method: HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective by adaptively distributing pruning budget across different spatial crops, ensuring retained tokens capture global visual context rather than isolated features.

Result: HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios. LLaVA1.5 with HoloV preserves 95.8% of original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens.

Conclusion: HoloV provides an effective solution for efficient MLLM inference by maintaining task-relevant information under aggressive pruning through holistic token retention strategy.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAW (Confidence-Aware Weighting) improves zero-shot robustness in vision-language models using confidence-aware loss and feature alignment regularization, outperforming recent methods with better clean/robust accuracy and lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, requiring improved robustness methods.

Method: CAW consists of two components: (1) Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by scaling KL divergence, and (2) feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency between frozen and fine-tuned encoder features.

Result: CAW outperforms recent methods (PMG-AFT, TGA-ZSR) under strong attacks like AutoAttack on TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets, achieving better clean and robust accuracy with less memory usage.

Conclusion: CAW effectively enhances zero-shot robustness in vision-language models without sacrificing generalization, demonstrating superior performance against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: This study evaluates large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging with clinical data, showing that domain adaptation and multimodal integration significantly improve stroke risk stratification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging information in a transparent and interpretable manner for clinicians.

Method: Proposed a framework using interview-style question sequences to test LVLMs, adapted LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna with LoRA for ultrasound domain, and integrated multimodal tabular data as text.

Result: Zero-shot experiments showed LVLMs struggled with imaging modality/anatomy identification and risk classification. Domain adaptation with LoRA substantially improved stroke risk stratification, and multimodal data integration enhanced specificity and balanced accuracy to competitive levels with CNN baselines.

Conclusion: LVLMs show promise but have limitations in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction, highlighting the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation for clinical applications.

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis use inefficient deep autoencoders with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable training strategies for feature separation.

Method: Proposes Flip Distribution Alignment VAE that encodes input and target images into symmetric latent distributions relative to standard normal distribution, using Y-shaped bidirectional training for interpretable feature separation.

Result: FDA-VAE significantly reduces model parameters and inference time while improving synthesis quality compared to existing deep autoencoder-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FDA-VAE provides an efficient and interpretable solution for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis with better performance and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LPG-Bench is a benchmark with 200 long prompts (avg 250+ words) to evaluate text-to-image models on long-prompt understanding. The paper also introduces TIT, a zero-shot metric using text-to-image-to-text consistency that outperforms existing metrics in aligning with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with long and detailed prompts, showing inconsistent generation. Existing evaluation metrics don't align well with human preferences for long-prompt-based image generation.

Method: Created LPG-Bench with 200 long prompts, generated 2,600 images from 13 models, and performed human annotations. Introduced TIT metric that compares prompt consistency with LMM-generated descriptions of images, with two instantiations: TIT-Score and TIT-Score-LLM.

Result: TIT-Score-LLM achieved 7.31% absolute improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. The metric shows superior alignment with human judgment compared to CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc.

Conclusion: LPG-Bench and TIT methods provide better benchmarking and development tools for text-to-image models, addressing the gap in evaluating long-prompt understanding and generation quality.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 3DEditVerse, the largest paired 3D editing benchmark, and 3DEditFormer, a novel transformer model that enables precise 3D editing without requiring manual 3D masks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D editing faces challenges with cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and controllability. Existing methods are slow, prone to distortions, or require error-prone manual 3D masks, making them impractical for widespread use.

Method: Two key contributions: 1) 3DEditVerse dataset with 116,309 training pairs and 1,500 test pairs built using pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits; 2) 3DEditFormer transformer with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating that disentangles editable regions from preserved structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and scalable 3D editing.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses key limitations in 3D editing by providing both a comprehensive dataset and an effective model that enables precise, consistent edits without auxiliary 3D masks, making 3D editing more practical and accessible.

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

*Sara Mobsite,Renaud Hostache,Laure Berti Equille,Emmanuel Roux,Joris Guerin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses land cover segmentation in tropical regions with frequent cloud cover by developing a cloud injection algorithm and proposing a lightweight method to inject Normalized Difference Indices into deep networks to retain spatial features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are cloud-free, limiting their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are common. There's also an issue of losing spatial/spectral details during encoder downsampling in deep networks.

Method: Developed a cloud injection algorithm to simulate realistic cloud cover, and proposed injecting Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs) into final decoding layers of deep networks to retain key spatial features with minimal computation.

Result: NDI injection improved land cover segmentation by 1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 radar data led to significant performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address cloud obstruction in tropical regions and feature loss in deep networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Result: Achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art single-step and multi-step RealSR models while being highly efficient.

Conclusion: PocketSR provides a practical solution for edge-device applications by balancing performance and efficiency through innovative architectural optimizations.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Motivation: Existing methods for multi-event video generation lack examination of intrinsic factors in event shifting, particularly regarding when and where prompts control event transitions during generation.

Method: Developed MEve prompt suite and conducted systematic study of OpenSora and CogVideoX models, focusing on early intervention in denoising steps and block-wise model layers.

Result: Experiments revealed the importance of early intervention in denoising steps and block-wise model layers for controlling multi-event transitions.

Conclusion: The study identifies essential factors for multi-event video generation and highlights possibilities for multi-event conditioning in future models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies how design choices affect compositional generalization in visual generative models, identifying key factors like discrete vs continuous training objectives and conditioning information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand mechanisms that enable or inhibit compositional generalization in image and video generation models.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to analyze design choices, then proposed combining MaskGIT's discrete loss with a continuous JEPA-based objective.

Result: Identified two key factors influencing compositional generalization: training objective type (discrete/continuous) and conditioning information about constituent concepts.

Conclusion: Relaxing discrete losses with auxiliary continuous objectives can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

*Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Shruti Agarwal,Tejas Gokhale,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel model-based perturbation method in latent space that makes images unlearnable for diffusion models while maintaining visual fidelity, protecting against unauthorized personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about data privacy and unauthorized usage in text-to-image diffusion models by creating "unlearnable" training samples that resist model replication and personalization.

Method: Trajectory-shifted sampling in latent space that alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory in diffusion models.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility (~8-10% on PSNR, SSIM, FID) and robustness (~10% across five adversarial settings) against state-of-the-art inversion attacks on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation by integrating unlearnability into Latent Diffusion Models framework.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry-grounded semantic features in radiance fields show finer structural details but don't improve semantic object localization or pose estimation accuracy compared to visual-only features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether geometry-grounded semantic features offer advantages over visual-only features in distilled radiance fields for spatial tasks like pose estimation.

Method: Proposed SPINE framework with two components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics and fine inversion using photometric-based optimization for radiance field inversion without initial guess.

Result: Geometry-grounded features contain finer structural details but show no significant improvement in semantic object localization and surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy compared to visual-only features.

Conclusion: Visual-only features offer greater versatility for downstream tasks, highlighting the need for future research on effective geometry-grounding strategies to enhance pretrained semantic features.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

### [119] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete is a novel framework for reference-driven image completion that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance through a dual-branch diffusion architecture and target-aware masking to ensure geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods for image completion rely solely on diffusion priors without geometric cues, leading to misaligned or implausible content when target views differ significantly from references.

Method: Uses dual-branch diffusion architecture: one branch synthesizes missing regions from masked target, another extracts geometric features from projected point clouds. Joint self-attention ensures coherence. Target-aware masking identifies occluded areas to focus on relevant reference cues.

Result: Achieves 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: GeoComplete provides a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion by integrating geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion with target-aware masking strategy.

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for Text-to-Sounding-Video generation that addresses modal interference and cross-modal interaction challenges through hierarchical captioning and a dual-tower diffusion transformer with bidirectional attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-Sounding-Video generation methods suffer from modal interference when using shared text captions and lack clear mechanisms for effective cross-modal feature interaction between audio and video modalities.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) to generate disentangled video and audio captions, and BridgeDiT - a dual-tower diffusion transformer with Dual CrossAttention mechanism for bidirectional cross-modal information exchange.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets with both automated metrics and human evaluations, demonstrating effective semantic and temporal synchronization between audio and video.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in T2SV generation and provides valuable insights for future research in this domain, with all code and checkpoints to be publicly released.

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

TL;DR: HAVIR model reconstructs visual information from brain activity by separating visual cortex into hierarchical regions, using structural and semantic components integrated via Versatile Diffusion to improve reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex visual stimuli due to heterogeneous low-level features and semantically entangled high-level features in natural scenes.

Method: Separates visual cortex into two hierarchical regions: Structural Generator extracts structural info from spatial voxels as diffusion priors, and Semantic Extractor converts semantic voxels to CLIP embeddings, integrated via Versatile Diffusion.

Result: HAVIR enhances both structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: Hierarchical representation approach inspired by visual cortex theory effectively improves visual information reconstruction from brain activity.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask2IV is a two-stage framework for generating interaction-centric videos without requiring dense mask annotations, using motion trajectory prediction followed by video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with modeling complex interactions in videos, and dense mask annotations are difficult to obtain for real-world applications.

Method: Decoupled two-stage pipeline: first predicts motion trajectories for actor and object, then generates video conditioned on these trajectories. Supports control via target object specification, action descriptions, or spatial position cues.

Result: Achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines on two curated benchmarks covering human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: Mask2IV provides an effective solution for interaction-centric video generation that eliminates the need for dense mask inputs while maintaining flexibility and control over the interaction process.

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

The model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k showed consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirmed diagnostic clarity and practical utility.

Conclusion: SpineMed addresses critical gaps in spine AI diagnosis by providing the first large-scale vertebral-level multimodal dataset and standardized evaluation framework, enabling clinically relevant AI assistance for spine disorders.

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic images are becoming increasingly realistic, posing risks like misinformation and fraud, while existing detection methods are too specialized and lack cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes UniShield with two agents: perception agent analyzes image features to select suitable detection models, and detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a unified framework with interpretable reports.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing unified approaches and domain-specific detectors.

Conclusion: UniShield demonstrates superior practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability for detecting and localizing image forgeries across diverse domains.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create relightable 3D models from multi-view captures that can be realistically rendered under novel lighting conditions without per-illumination optimization.

Method: Uses generative relighting model to sample appearances under multiple lighting environments, trains lighting-conditioned NeRF with dual-branch architecture to separate general lighting effects and specularities.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets on most metrics, demonstrated on real-world object captures.

Conclusion: ROGR enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our

Conclusion: The proposed training strategy effectively addresses computational challenges while maintaining strong performance in interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that
can iteratively refine predictions based on user prompts. Current foundation
models either lack volumetric awareness or suffer from limited interactive
capabilities. We propose a training strategy that combines dynamic volumetric
prompt generation with content-aware adaptive cropping to optimize the use of
the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns
during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from
sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we
initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the
nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models
for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation} competition demonstrates
strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized
surface distance of 0.6614, and area-under-the-curve metrics of 2.4799 (Dice)

*Denis Zavadski,Nikita Philip Tatsch,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQGAN integrates product quantization into VQGAN framework, achieving significant improvements in image reconstruction performance and enabling faster/higher-resolution generation with diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Product quantization has limited usage in high-fidelity image generation despite being a classical method for scalable vector encoding. The paper aims to bridge this gap by integrating PQ into the established VQGAN framework.

Method: PQGAN combines product quantization with vector quantization in an autoencoder framework. The key innovation is analyzing the interaction between codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorization, with vector and scalar quantization as special cases.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 37dB (vs 27dB prior work), reduces FID, LPIPS, and CMMD scores by up to 96%. Enables either faster/more efficient generation or doubling output resolution at no additional cost when integrated with diffusion models.

Conclusion: Product quantization is a strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis, with PQGAN demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods and seamless integration with pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

*Junchao Huang,Xinting Hu,Boyao Han,Shaoshuai Shi,Zhuotao Tian,Tianyu He,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory Forcing is a learning framework that improves autoregressive video diffusion models for Minecraft gameplay by balancing temporal and spatial memory usage, achieving better long-term spatial consistency and generation quality while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive video diffusion models face a trade-off between temporal-only memory (lacking long-term spatial consistency) and spatial memory (potentially degrading new scene generation quality when over-relied upon).

Method: Memory Forcing combines: 1) Hybrid Training exposing different gameplay regimes, 2) Chained Forward Training with model rollouts, 3) Point-to-Frame Retrieval for efficient history access, and 4) Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintaining an explicit 3D cache.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed Memory Forcing framework effectively balances temporal and spatial memory usage in autoregressive video diffusion models, achieving improved spatial consistency and generation quality for Minecraft gameplay simulation.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonSTeR is the first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model that creates a unified latent space to capture dependencies between skeletal movement, surrounding context, and intention, enabling flexible cross-modal retrieval and outperforming unimodal-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks tools to evaluate alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text), and surrounding context (scene), despite the intuitive relationship between these modalities in human movement.

Method: Constructs a unified latent space by leveraging unimodal and cross-modal representations, inspired by higher-order relations modeling. Captures intricate dependencies between modalities for robust retrieval.

Result: Outperforms trimodal models relying solely on unimodal representations. User study validates alignment with human preferences. Demonstrates versatility on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning tasks.

Conclusion: MonSTeR successfully addresses the gap in evaluating motion-text-scene alignment through unified latent space modeling, enabling flexible cross-modal retrieval and showing strong performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, architecture-agnostic test-time defense that uses stochastic resonance by introducing small translational perturbations to combat adversarial attacks, achieving state-of-the-art robustness across image classification, stereo matching, and optical flow tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods rely on feature filtering or smoothing which can cause information loss. The paper aims to develop a defense that enhances robustness while minimizing information loss.

Method: Introduces small translational perturbations to input images, aligns transformed feature embeddings, aggregates them, and maps back to original reference image using a closed-form formula. No additional network modules or fine-tuning required.

Result: Recovers up to 68.1% of accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various adversarial attacks. First generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, versatile, and practical - entirely training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic, making it suitable for diverse applications without requiring modifications to existing networks.

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing randomized neural networks for texture recognition have focused mainly on cross-information prediction without significant architectural improvements, creating an opportunity for better randomized network designs.

Method: Proposes Mixer with hyperspherical random embeddings and a dual-branch learning module to capture intra- and inter-channel relationships, enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for building rich texture representations.

Result: Experimental results show interesting performance across several pure texture benchmarks with distinct characteristics and challenges.

Conclusion: Mixer demonstrates promising results for texture representation learning through its novel randomized architecture combining hyperspherical embeddings and dual-branch learning.

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to

novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code

*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RULER tokens and Interleaved MRoPE to improve GUI grounding accuracy by providing explicit spatial guidance instead of relying on implicit coordinate generation, especially for high-resolution displays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with GUI grounding due to unreliable patch-to-pixel mapping, particularly when extrapolating to unseen high-resolution displays. Text-based coordinate generation forces implicit learning of complex mappings, leading to accuracy degradation.

Method: Two innovations: 1) RULER tokens as explicit coordinate markers for reference-based positioning, 2) Interleaved MRoPE for improved spatial encoding that ensures equal representation of width and height dimensions.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces.

Conclusion: By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit learning, the approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with out-of-distribution tasks in specialized domains like medical imaging where labeled data is scarce and expensive, creating a need for more efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled data using QA generator regularized by caption distillation, with selective updates of only the most relevant neurons for question-answering.

Result: LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed LEAML framework effectively addresses the challenge of adapting MLLMs to specialized domains with limited labeled data through pseudo QA generation and selective parameter updates.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

Motivation: Existing driving scene manipulation frameworks have limited editing capabilities and struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently, creating a need for more intuitive and flexible editing tools.

Method: Uses language-aligned Gaussian splatting to reconstruct scenes, enabling natural language control for object-level editing including adding objects and modifying trajectories, with multi-agent motion prediction for realistic interactions.

Result: Experiments on Waymo dataset demonstrate extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across various scenarios, showing improved realism and flexibility compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SIMSplat provides an effective solution for realistic driving scene manipulation with intuitive language control and predictive capabilities, advancing the field of driving simulation and scene editing.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising

TL;DR: This paper presents REACT-Drive, a framework that integrates Visual Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to improve trajectory planning in work zones, reducing errors by 3x compared to baseline VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Visual Language Models fail in 68% of work zone trajectory planning cases due to irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamic geometric structures, creating a need for more robust planning solutions.

Method: REACT-Drive combines VLMs with RAG, using VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.

Result: REACT-Drive achieves a 3x reduction in average displacement error compared to VLM baselines, with the lowest inference time (0.58s) and successful real-world validation in 15 work zone scenarios.

Conclusion: REACT-Drive demonstrates strong practicality for autonomous driving in work zones by effectively addressing VLM failures through pattern-based retrieval and constraint-guided trajectory planning.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM-Nav, a Vision-Language-Action model that learns diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data using a teacher-student approach, achieving strong generalization and outperforming RL teachers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation policies using egocentric observations are promising but challenging due to the difficulty in explicitly modeling optical information, requiring intelligent models and large-scale data.

Method: Implement MM-Nav as a multi-view VLA model based on pretrained LLMs and visual foundation models, collecting expert data from three RL experts trained with privileged depth information in specialized environments for different navigation capabilities, and iteratively training with dynamically balanced data ratios.

Result: The model achieves strong generalization capability in synthetic environments and outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating synergistic effects from integrating multiple capabilities. Real-world experiments confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed VLA model successfully learns diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data, showing improved performance over individual RL experts and strong generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

*Yilun Hao,Yongchao Chen,Chuchu Fan,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLMFP is a dual-VLM framework that autonomously generates both PDDL problem and domain files for visual planning, overcoming limitations of previous methods that required human-defined domain files or constant environment access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning for visual planning, while PDDL planners excel at formal planning but cannot interpret visual inputs. Previous methods combining these approaches relied on human experts to predefine domain files or required constant environment access for refinement.

Method: VLMFP uses two VLMs: SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing PDDL and SimVLM execution results.

Result: SimVLM accurately describes 95.5% of seen scenarios and 82.6% of unseen scenarios, simulates 85.5%-87.8% of action sequences, and judges 82.4%-85.6% goal reaching. VLMFP generates PDDL files achieving 70.0% valid plans for unseen instances in seen appearances and 54.1% for unseen appearances.

Conclusion: VLMFP enables autonomous generation of both PDDL problem and domain files for visual planning, demonstrating strong generalization across different instances, appearances, and game rules without requiring human intervention or constant environment access.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

Conclusion: The fine-tuned MM-LLM successfully generates accurate clinical descriptions from OCT imaging, providing high-quality automated assessment of image quality, glaucoma detection, and sectoral RNFL thinning to support clinical evaluation.

Abstract: Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM)
that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2)
generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and
sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design:
Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH
OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and
ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was
fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data
included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical
reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans
were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model
was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment,
glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical
sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using
standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and
0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86
(sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction
accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and
temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference
reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1:
0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical
descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in
identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also
provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT
evaluation.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SpeechCT-CLIP learns visual-language representations directly from spoken radiology reports, using knowledge distillation from text-image CLIP to bridge the performance gap between speech and text models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical workflows heavily rely on spoken communication (e.g., radiology dictation), but most medical AI systems only use written text, creating a gap between clinical practice and AI tools.

Method: Created Speech-RATE dataset of spoken radiology reports and trained SpeechCT-CLIP - a contrastive model aligning speech and 3D CT volumes using knowledge distillation from pretrained text-image CLIP models.

Result: Knowledge distillation substantially improved zero-shot classification F1 from 0.623 to 0.705 (recovering 88% of performance gap) and achieved strong retrieval results without requiring text at inference.

Conclusion: Speech is a practical alternative to text for multimodal pretraining, enabling voice-driven diagnostic support tools that align with clinical workflows.

Abstract: Spoken communication plays a central role in clinical workflows. In
radiology, for example, most reports are created through dictation. Yet, nearly
all medical AI systems rely exclusively on written text. In this work, we
address this gap by exploring the feasibility of learning visual-language
representations directly from spoken radiology reports. Specifically, we
synthesize a large-scale dataset (Speech-RATE) of spoken radiology reports and
train SpeechCT-CLIP, a contrastive model that aligns speech and 3D CT volumes
in a shared representation space. While naive speech-based models underperform
compared to text-trained counterparts, we show that knowledge distillation from
a pretrained text-image CLIP model effectively transfers semantic alignment
capabilities from text to speech, substantially narrowing this gap. Experiments
demonstrate improved zero-shot classification F1 from 0.623 to 0.705,
recovering 88% of the performance difference, and strong retrieval results
without requiring text at inference. These findings highlight speech as a
practical alternative to text in multimodal pretraining and open the door to
voice-driven diagnostic support tools in clinical practice.

*Chinthana Wimalasuriya,Spyros Tragoudas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes a statistical approach using compressed/uncompressed neural network pairs to detect adversarial attacks with high accuracy and low false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack detection methods struggle with detecting unseen attacks and achieving high accuracy across different attack types.

Method: Uses a statistical baseline approach comparing behavior of compressed/uncompressed neural network pairs to generate adversarial presence metrics.

Result: Achieves near-perfect detection across wide range of attack types and significantly reduces false positives compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method is reliable and practical for real-world adversarial detection applications.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant threat to modern machine learning
systems. Yet, existing detection methods often lack the ability to detect
unseen attacks or detect different attack types with a high level of accuracy.
In this work, we propose a statistical approach that establishes a detection
baseline before a neural network's deployment, enabling effective real-time
adversarial detection. We generate a metric of adversarial presence by
comparing the behavior of a compressed/uncompressed neural network pair. Our
method has been tested against state-of-the-art techniques, and it achieves
near-perfect detection across a wide range of attack types. Moreover, it
significantly reduces false positives, making it both reliable and practical
for real-world applications.

*Lekkala Sai Teja,Annepaka Yadagiri,Sangam Sai Anish,Siva Gopala Krishna Nuthakki,Partha Pakray*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PIFE, a novel framework for detecting AI-generated text that is robust against adversarial attacks, especially semantic paraphrasing, outperforming conventional adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dual-use problem of advanced LLMs necessitates reliable AI-generated text detection, but current detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like paraphrasing that evade statistical detection.

Method: Proposes Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering (PIFE) - a multi-stage normalization pipeline that transforms text to standardized form, then quantifies transformation magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein distance and semantic similarity as features for classification.

Result: Conventional adversarial training fails against semantic attacks (48.8% TPR at 1% FPR), while PIFE maintains 82.6% TPR under same conditions, effectively neutralizing sophisticated semantic attacks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts through feature engineering is more effective than merely training on adversarial examples for achieving genuine robustness in AI text detection.

Abstract: The growth of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) constitutes a huge
dual-use problem, making it necessary to create dependable AI-generated text
detection systems. Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that
foils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of
adversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard
adversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more
resilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering
(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text
into a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then
quantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein
distance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the
classifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our
PIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and
sentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional
adversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against
semantic attacks, an effect we term "semantic evasion threshold", where its
True Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In
stark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the
discrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation.
It maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively
neutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance
demonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than
merely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine
robustness in the adversarial arms race.

*Yu Zhang,Shuliang Liu,Xu Yang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CAT is a context-aware watermarking framework that dynamically adjusts watermarking intensity based on semantic context, improving text quality in cross-task scenarios without sacrificing detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM watermarking methods degrade text quality, especially in low-entropy scenarios, and require computational resources for tuning thresholds while showing poor adaptability to unknown or cross-task generation.

Method: Partitions text generation into semantic states using logits clustering, establishes context-aware entropy thresholds that preserve fidelity in structured content while embedding robust watermarks, requiring no pre-defined thresholds or task-specific tuning.

Result: Improves text quality in cross-tasks without sacrificing detection accuracy.

Conclusion: CAT provides an effective watermarking solution that dynamically adapts to semantic context, overcoming limitations of static threshold-based methods.

Abstract: Watermarking algorithms for Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively identify
machine-generated content by embedding and detecting hidden statistical
features in text. However, such embedding leads to a decline in text quality,
especially in low-entropy scenarios where performance needs improvement.
Existing methods that rely on entropy thresholds often require significant
computational resources for tuning and demonstrate poor adaptability to unknown
or cross-task generation scenarios. We propose \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{T}hreshold watermarking ($\myalgo$), a novel framework that dynamically
adjusts watermarking intensity based on real-time semantic context. $\myalgo$
partitions text generation into semantic states using logits clustering,
establishing context-aware entropy thresholds that preserve fidelity in
structured content while embedding robust watermarks. Crucially, it requires no
pre-defined thresholds or task-specific tuning. Experiments show $\myalgo$
improves text quality in cross-tasks without sacrificing detection accuracy.

### [147] [Representing Beauty: Towards a Participatory but Objective Latent Aesthetics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02869)
*Alexander Michael Rusnak*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Neural networks can model aesthetic judgment by showing cross-model representational convergence for beautiful images, suggesting beauty has a realist basis beyond social construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether machines can genuinely recognize beauty and understand if aesthetic judgment has a realist basis or is purely socially constructed.

Method: Analyzed cross-model representational convergence between neural networks trained on distinct data and modalities, comparing how aesthetic vs non-aesthetic images produce aligned representations.

Result: Beautiful images produce more similar and aligned representations across different models, while unaesthetic images do not, indicating beauty has formal structure with realist basis.

Conclusion: Beauty has a realist basis grounded in both physical and cultural substance, enabling human-machine co-creation with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in cultural production and machine perception.

Abstract: What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a
culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept,
deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic
judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to
represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the
term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational
convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned
representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and
modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned
representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful
images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially
constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations
exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural
substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role
in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist
basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can
produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our
findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but
foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural
production and machine perception.

*Nishanth Shetty,Madhava Prasath,Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a biologically inspired generative model using multiplicative updates based on geometric Brownian motion, connecting exponential gradient descent from Dale's law with reverse-time SDE discretization for score-based generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent optimization is inconsistent with biological learning systems. Inspired by Dale's law (inhibitory/excitatory synapses don't swap roles), the authors explore biologically plausible learning techniques that lead to log-normally distributed synaptic weights.

Method: Leveraging the connection between geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and log-normal distributions, the authors discretize the reverse-time SDE of GBM to derive multiplicative update rules. This coincides with exponential gradient descent from Dale's law. They propose multiplicative denoising score-matching for training score-based models on positive data.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate the generative capability of the proposed multiplicative update scheme. The method successfully generates samples starting from log-normal densities.

Conclusion: This work presents the first biologically inspired generative model using multiplicative updates based on geometric Brownian motion, establishing connections between neuroscience principles, stochastic differential equations, and score-based generative modeling.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

TL;DR: A unified framework for unsupervised model evaluation using confidence and dispersity metrics, showing hybrid approaches outperform single metrics across various distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing model generalization without labeled test data in real-world deployment scenarios.

Method: Proposes using confidence (prediction certainty) and dispersity (prediction diversity) metrics, systematically benchmarking confidence-based, dispersity-based, and hybrid metrics across various models, datasets, and distribution shifts.

Result: Hybrid metrics consistently outperform single-aspect metrics in both dataset-centric and model-centric evaluation settings. Nuclear norm of prediction matrix provides robust performance across tasks and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model assessment in deployment scenarios, with hybrid metrics providing the most reliable evaluation.

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: Advisor Models are lightweight parametric policies trained with RL to dynamically issue natural language steering instructions to black-box foundation models, outperforming static prompt optimization by adapting to different inputs, users, and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services where model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting. Static prompt optimization produces fixed prompts that fail to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments.

Method: Train lightweight parametric policies with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor model sits between input and model, shaping behavior per-instance using reward signals from the environment.

Result: Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization. They discover environment dynamics, improve downstream task performance, transfer across black-box models, and achieve specialization while retaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs.

Conclusion: Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems, acting as parametric, environment-specific memory. Dynamic optimization via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a

TL;DR: SFT is equivalent to Inverse RL, learning both policy and implicit dense token-level rewards, which can be recovered and used for policy improvement via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional view of SFT as simple imitation learning and establish its equivalence with Inverse RL to reveal its reward learning capabilities.

Method: Prove SFT objective is special case of Inverse Q-Learning, formulate baseline-relative reward function to recover dense rewards, and develop Dense-Path REINFORCE for policy improvement.

Result: Recovered dense rewards enable granular credit assignment, and Dense-Path REINFORCE consistently outperforms original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: SFT should be reframed as powerful reward learning mechanism beyond policy imitation, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

TL;DR: HyperAdaLoRA accelerates AdaLoRA convergence using a hypernetwork with attention mechanisms to dynamically generate SVD parameters, achieving faster training without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow convergence and high computational overhead in AdaLoRA, which uses dynamic rank allocation via SVD but suffers from training inefficiency.

Method: Employ hypernetwork with attention mechanisms to generate SVD parameters (P, Λ, Q) instead of direct optimization, with pruning of singular value outputs for dynamic rank allocation.

Result: Achieves faster convergence while maintaining performance across various datasets and models, with broad applicability validated on other LoRA-based approaches.

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA effectively accelerates AdaLoRA training through hypernetwork-based parameter generation, offering improved efficiency for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

*Nicholas Lourie,He He,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new theory and tools for understanding hyperparameter loss surfaces, discovering that simple structure emerges near optima characterized by features like effective dimension and best possible loss. A novel random search technique reveals a new distribution whose parameters define the asymptotic loss surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameters greatly impact model capabilities but modern models are too large for extensive search. Few tools exist for understanding hyperparameter loss surfaces, despite the importance of designing effective training recipes across scales.

Method: Developed a novel technique based on random search to uncover the asymptotic regime of loss surfaces. Within this regime, the best scores from random search follow a new discovered distribution whose parameters define the loss surface features.

Result: The method reveals that loss surfaces become characterized by simple features like effective dimension and best possible loss in the asymptotic regime. Derived a new asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its convergence.

Conclusion: These new tools enable novel analyses such as confidence intervals for best possible performance and determining effective number of hyperparameters. The tools are made publicly available for researchers.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

*Shashank Agnihotri,Jonas Jakubassa,Priyam Dey,Sachin Goyal,Bernt Schiele,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether common safety interventions like refusal training survive activation edits, using model abliteration to test robustness across safety pretraining checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if safety interventions in open-weight LLMs remain effective when models are modified at inference time with activation edits.

Method: Used model abliteration (lightweight projection) to remove refusal-sensitive directions, evaluated across 20 systems (original and abliterated) using 100 balanced prompts, classified responses with multiple judges, and validated judge fidelity.

Result: Produced checkpoint-level characterization of robust safety components under abliteration, quantified judge selection influence on evaluation outcomes, and developed protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into which data-centric safety components remain robust under activation edits and establishes practical evaluation protocols for safety assessments.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

### [156] [Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03222)
*Guanhua Huang,Tingqiang Xu,Mingze Wang,Qi Yi,Xue Gong,Siheng Li,Ruibin Xiong,Kejiao Li,Yuhao Jiang,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg) to address the training bottleneck in RLVR where performance plateaus due to loss of exploration, specifically by preserving valuable low-probability exploratory tokens called "reasoning sparks" that get eliminated during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR faces scalability issues where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, losing exploration. Previous methods focus on maintaining high entropy but risk amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. The key problem is the systematic elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens (reasoning sparks) during RLVR training.

Method: Introduces Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg) that regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing over remaining candidates, amplifying the probability of reasoning sparks. The proxy serves as a soft regularization target via KL divergence to shield these valuable tokens from elimination.

Result: Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 60.17% average accuracy on five math benchmarks, improving by 2.66% over prior methods.

Conclusion: Lp-Reg effectively addresses the exploration collapse problem in RLVR by preserving reasoning sparks through targeted regularization, enabling sustained exploration and improved performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

*Jingjie Ning,Yibo Kong,Yunfan Long,Jamie Callan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Scaling the retriever's corpus in RAG systems can reduce reliance on large LLMs, with corpus expansion often serving as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While scaling LLM generators improves accuracy, it increases costs and limits deployability. The paper explores an alternative approach of enlarging the retriever's corpus to achieve similar benefits.

Method: Experimental investigation of corpus scaling in RAG systems, analyzing how different corpus sizes affect performance when paired with generators of various sizes (tiny to large).

Result: Corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG performance. Small- and mid-sized generators with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora. Mid-sized models gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Improvements come primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages.

Conclusion: There exists a principled corpus-generator trade-off where investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG performance, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large
language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also
raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging
the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results
show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a
substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger
scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival
much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the
most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that
improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing
passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These
findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger
corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging
the LLM itself.

*Cuong Chi Le,Minh V. T. Pham,Cuong Duc Van,Hoang N. Phan,Huy N. Phan,Tien N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs rely on naming patterns rather than structural semantics for code understanding, as shown by performance drops when identifiers are obfuscated, leading to the creation of ClassEval-Obf benchmark for more reliable assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs derive program meaning and disentangle the effects of structural semantics versus human-interpretable naming in code understanding.

Method: Introduce semantics-preserving obfuscations to remove naming cues while preserving code behavior, and create ClassEval-Obf benchmark to systematically suppress naming patterns.

Result: Obfuscation causes significant performance degradation on both intent-level tasks (summarization) and execution tasks, revealing that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than genuine semantic reasoning.

Conclusion: ClassEval-Obf provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code understanding by reducing inflated performance gaps and weakening memorization shortcuts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how
they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates
through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and
human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel
severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models
regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent
reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing
that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than
genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite
of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier
leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we
release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically
suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that
ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization
shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code
understanding and generalization.

*Jeffrey Regier*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper proposes an amortized variational inference method with spatially autoregressive variational distributions for detecting small astronomical objects in large-scale sky surveys, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Sloan Digital Sky Survey images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution images containing billions of faint and overlapping astronomical objects, making detection and characterization a fundamental but challenging task in astronomy.

Method: Uses amortized variational inference with spatially autoregressive variational distributions that partition the latent space using a K-color checkerboard pattern. The method employs neural posterior estimation (NPE) with a convolutional neural network to minimize forward KL divergence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sloan Digital Sky Survey images and demonstrates that the proposed autoregressive structure greatly improves posterior calibration.

Conclusion: The spatially autoregressive variational inference approach effectively addresses the challenge of small-object detection in astronomical images, providing improved performance and better posterior calibration for large-scale sky surveys.

Abstract: Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution
images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and
galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images
is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these
objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an
amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of
small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially
autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent
space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the
conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the
posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is
parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior
estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using
images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure
greatly improves posterior calibration.

*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (TTS) with multiple reasoning traces has limitations - accuracy plateaus at large K, and temperature scaling across different temperatures significantly improves reasoning performance beyond single-temperature approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work shows that increasing reasoning samples (K) steadily improves accuracy, but this trend doesn't hold indefinitely - hard questions remain unsolved regardless of K, and single-temperature scaling only explores part of a model's potential.

Method: Propose temperature scaling across different sampling temperatures, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Also design a multi-temperature voting method to reduce overhead.

Result: Temperature scaling yields additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS across Qwen3 models and five reasoning benchmarks. Enables base models to reach performance comparable to RL-trained counterparts without additional post-training.

Conclusion: TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

TL;DR: Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV) is a training-free framework that improves LLM reasoning verification through lightweight binary consistency checks at the node level, achieving better performance with significantly fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for verifying multi-step reasoning in LLMs suffer from imprecise error localization, high token costs, attention dilution, and expensive multi-sampling requirements.

Method: NCV decomposes chain of thought into interconnected verification nodes and performs binary consistency checks at each node, avoiding long-form generation and enabling precise error localization.

Result: NCV achieves 10% to 25% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while using 6× to 58× fewer tokens than traditional CoT-based verifiers on public datasets.

Conclusion: NCV provides a scalable solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification with enhanced interpretability and efficiency through node-level consistency checking.

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based

*Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Yeonjun In,Sein Kim,Dongha Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents that assesses reasoning trajectories beyond just final answers, addressing limitations of current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-augmented benchmarks evaluate only final answers, ignoring important aspects like efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity in problem-solving trajectories. Ground-truth trajectory annotation is expensive, and simple LLM evaluators struggle without ground truth.

Method: TRACE incorporates an evidence bank that accumulates knowledge from preceding reasoning steps, enabling multi-faceted analysis of agent trajectories. A meta-evaluation dataset was created by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse flawed trajectories labeled with multi-faceted scores.

Result: TRACE accurately evaluates complex agent behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. The framework provides previously unreported observations and insights about agent trajectories.

Conclusion: TRACE provides an effective solution for comprehensive evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents, going beyond answer matching to assess reasoning trajectories across multiple dimensions including efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: Continuous diffusion models have stronger theoretical expressivity than discrete diffusions but underperform in practice due to decoding difficulties. CCDD proposes a joint multimodal diffusion process combining continuous representation space and discrete token space to leverage the advantages of both modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness of continuous diffusion models and their empirical underperformance compared to discrete counterparts, by solving the practical trainability and decoding issues.

Method: Proposes Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD) - a joint multimodal diffusion process that simultaneously denoises in both continuous representation space and discrete token space using a single model, with specialized architectures and training/sampling techniques.

Result: CCDD achieves strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks, demonstrating improved expressivity, trainability, and sample quality.

Conclusion: CCDD successfully bridges the gap between theoretical expressivity and practical performance by combining continuous and discrete modalities, offering a promising approach for diffusion language models.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel distance function based on probability densities that connects information theory and estimation theory through denoising errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a distance metric that adapts to the geometry of complex signal distributions by leveraging the relationship between information theory and estimation theory, particularly using denoising performance.

Method: IEM is derived by comparing denoising error vectors over noise amplitudes, using score vector fields of blurred densities. It can be computed with learned denoisers and involves solving a one-dimensional integral.

Result: IEM is proven to be a valid global metric and reduces to Mahalanobis distance for Gaussian distributions. When learned on ImageNet, it competes with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Conclusion: IEM provides a principled framework for distance metrics that adapt to distribution geometry and shows practical effectiveness in image quality assessment tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of
distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density
over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship
between information theory and estimation theory, which links the
log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to
noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of
signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of
noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector
fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.
We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form
expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian
metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the
Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both
locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM
can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion
models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our
framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this
IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image
quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and
mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel image enhancement method using pigment representation that transforms RGB colors to high-dimensional pigments, adaptively reprojects them based on image content, and transforms back to RGB for superior enhancement with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional color transformation methods are limited to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, lacking adaptability to input content. The paper aims to develop a more flexible and expressive representation for image enhancement.

Method: Transforms RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, adaptively reprojects and blends them using parameters from a visual encoder, then transforms back to RGB. The encoder estimates transformation parameters based on input image content.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in image retouching and tone mapping tasks, while maintaining low computational complexity and small model size.

Conclusion: Pigment representation provides an adaptable and expressive approach for image enhancement, outperforming conventional methods while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on
pigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color
transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method
dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a
high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed
pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving
superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves
transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then
reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of
the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB
colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and
reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively
estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including
image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low
computational complexity and small model size.

### [167] [GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02781)
*Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GCVAMD is a novel causal AMD analysis model that uses modified CausalVAE to extract latent causal factors from OCT images, enabling causal inference for AMD risk factors like drusen and neovascularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous deep learning methods focused only on prediction performance without considering underlying causal mechanisms of AMD, which limits intervention analysis and reliability. There's a need for models that can identify pathologies and causal factors.

Method: GCVAMD incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach to extract latent causal factors from raw OCT images, enabling causal inference for AMD risk factors including drusen and neovascularization.

Result: GCVAMD successfully identifies drusen status and neovascularization status with AMD causal mechanisms in latent spaces, which can be used for various tasks from AMD classification to intervention analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed GCVAMD model enables causal inference for AMD analysis, providing informative latent causal features that enhance downstream tasks while allowing treatment simulation and intervention analysis on major risk factors.

Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes
of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as
anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the
degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision
loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD
or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to
reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,
deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and
GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in
distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI
driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists
regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works
mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying
causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific
factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a
novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified
CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT
images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal
inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major
risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent
causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through
GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD
causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for
various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

Motivation: To enable equitable deployment of AI tools in healthcare by developing segmentation networks that can be trained on cost-effective GPUs with limited memory while maintaining high performance.

Method: Proposed Wave-GMS, a lightweight multi-scale generative model that doesn't require memory-intensive pretrained vision foundation models and supports training with large batch sizes on limited-memory GPUs.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance on four public datasets (BUS, BUSI, Kvasir-Instrument, HAM10000) with superior cross-domain generalizability using only ~2.6M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Wave-GMS provides an efficient solution for medical image segmentation that enables equitable AI deployment in healthcare settings by reducing computational requirements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: For equitable deployment of AI tools in hospitals and healthcare facilities,
we need Deep Segmentation Networks that offer high performance and can be
trained on cost-effective GPUs with limited memory and large batch sizes. In
this work, we propose Wave-GMS, a lightweight and efficient multi-scale
generative model for medical image segmentation. Wave-GMS has a substantially
smaller number of trainable parameters, does not require loading
memory-intensive pretrained vision foundation models, and supports training
with large batch sizes on GPUs with limited memory. We conducted extensive
experiments on four publicly available datasets (BUS, BUSI, Kvasir-Instrument,
and HAM10000), demonstrating that Wave-GMS achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance with superior cross-domain generalizability, while
requiring only ~2.6M trainable parameters. Code is available at

### [169] [Pareto-optimal Non-uniform Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02795)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Pareto-optimal algorithm for non-uniform language generation in the limit, improving upon previous approaches that had sub-optimal generation times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works by Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024), Li et al. (2024), and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform generation guarantees but had strictly sub-optimal language-wise generation times. The authors aim to achieve Pareto-optimality in generation times.

Method: The authors propose an algorithmic framework that achieves (almost) Pareto-optimal generation times, where no other algorithm can improve generation time for one language without worsening it for another language.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation times, which is essentially the best possible guarantee for this problem. The framework also adapts to noisy and representative generation settings.

Conclusion: Pareto-optimality is the best achievable guarantee for non-uniform language generation in the limit, and the proposed algorithm achieves this optimality while being adaptable to practical settings like noisy and representative generation.

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for
language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages,
and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the
collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language,
such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman
and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform
generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid
strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that
depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order.
However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the
algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation
in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are
(almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some
language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its
generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than
$t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve
for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to
further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the
practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.
