### [1] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework that modifies diplomatic event narratives to shift public sentiment from negative to neutral/positive using a language model trained on diplomatic event descriptions and public discussions, achieving 70% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for gauging public sentiment in diplomacy are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and lack forward-looking analysis capabilities. Public sentiment is critical for policy implementation, international issue resolution, and national image.

Method: 1) Train language model to predict public reactions to diplomatic events using constructed dataset; 2) Predetermine textual features for modification guided by communication theories and domain experts; 3) Develop counterfactual generation algorithm using LLM to systematically produce modified versions while preserving core facts.

Result: The framework successfully shifted public sentiment to more favorable states with a 70% success rate.

Conclusion: This framework serves as a practical tool for diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives to foster more desirable public sentiment.

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

### [2] [Speaker Style-Aware Phoneme Anchoring for Improved Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20373)
*Shreya G. Upadhyay,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework for cross-lingual speech emotion recognition that aligns emotional expression at phonetic and speaker levels using emotion-specific speaker communities and dual-space anchoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition is challenging due to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles across languages, requiring better alignment of emotion externalization across speakers and languages.

Method: Builds emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering, then applies dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.

Result: Evaluations on MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin) corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into commonalities in cross-lingual emotion representation and effectively addresses cross-lingual SER challenges.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past

performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,

### [4] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates machine learning approaches for detecting ChatGPT-3.5 generated research abstracts, finding DistilBERT performs best while ensemble methods don't surpass single transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT has blurred human-AI text boundaries, raising concerns about academic integrity, intellectual property, and misinformation, necessitating reliable AI-text detection.

Method: Tested classical (Logistic Regression with BoW, POS, TF-IDF) and transformer-based (BERT with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with custom classifier, LSTM-N-gram) ML techniques on 250 pairs of human vs ChatGPT-3.5 research abstracts, including ensemble methods.

Result: DistilBERT achieved the best overall performance, while Logistic Regression and BERT-Custom offered solid alternatives. LSTM and BERT-N-gram approaches lagged. Ensemble methods failed to surpass DistilBERT's performance.

Conclusion: Single transformer-based representations (like DistilBERT) outperform model diversity, laying foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger datasets to keep pace with improving generative AI.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConceptViz is a visual analytics system that bridges the gap between sparse autoencoder features and human-understandable concepts in LLMs through an identification-interpretation-validation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract interpretable features from LLMs but these features don't naturally align with human concepts, making interpretation labor-intensive and cumbersome.

Method: ConceptViz implements a novel pipeline: identification => interpretation => validation, allowing users to query SAEs using concepts, explore concept-to-feature alignments interactively, and validate correspondences through model behavior verification.

Result: The system was demonstrated through usage scenarios and a user study, showing it enhances interpretability research by streamlining discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs.

Conclusion: ConceptViz helps researchers build more accurate mental models of LLM features and improves interpretability research for understanding how LLMs internally represent knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

### [6] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG is a novel method that uses LLMs' self-knowledge to filter irrelevant retrieved documents in RAG systems, improving answer quality while reducing input documents through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval systems in RAG often return irrelevant content that causes hallucinations when incorporated into LLMs. Understanding what models "know" and "don't know" (self-knowledge) is crucial for better integrating internal and external knowledge.

Method: Proposes SKILL-RAG which uses reinforcement learning to elicit self-knowledge from models and employs sentence-level granularity filtering to remove irrelevant retrieved content while preserving useful knowledge.

Result: Evaluation on Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B shows SKILL-RAG improves generation quality and significantly reduces the number of input documents across multiple question answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: Self-knowledge is important for guiding selection of high-quality retrievals in RAG systems, and SKILL-RAG effectively leverages this to enhance performance while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [7] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM is a fine-grained emotion modeling framework for text-to-speech that enables word-level emotion control through Feature-wise Linear Modulation, outperforming existing approaches on both global and fine-grained emotion expression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotional TTS systems rely on sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural language prompts, which fail to capture dynamic emotional shifts within a sentence.

Method: Aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, then maps them through a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer to directly modulate text embeddings for word-level emotion control. Constructed FEDD dataset for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks, demonstrating effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM successfully addresses the limitation of capturing dynamic emotional shifts within sentences and enables fine-grained emotion control in TTS systems.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

### [8] [USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381)
*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: USB-Rec is an integrated training-inference framework that enhances LLMs for conversational recommendation through preference optimization dataset construction and self-enhancement strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for conversational recommender systems focus on leveraging summarization and analysis capabilities but ignore training, limiting their performance potential.

Method: Proposes USB-Rec framework with: 1) LLM-based Preference Optimization dataset construction for RL training, and 2) Self-Enhancement Strategy at inference stage to enhance conversational recommendation capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across various datasets.

Conclusion: The integrated training-inference framework effectively improves LLM performance in conversational recommendation by addressing both training and inference optimization.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Conformal Importance Summarization is a framework that uses conformal prediction to provide rigorous coverage guarantees for automatic summarization, ensuring critical content is preserved in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic summarization systems lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance, which limits their safe deployment.

Method: The framework uses conformal prediction to calibrate thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, enabling extractive document summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. It is model-agnostic and requires only a small calibration set.

Result: Experiments on established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate.

Conclusion: Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical applications.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

### [11] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS is a role-based multi-agent collaboration framework that reduces computational overhead while maintaining reasoning quality compared to Multi-Agent Debate approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) improves LLM reasoning but introduces substantial computational overhead due to multiple agents and frequent communication. MARS aims to maintain reasoning quality while controlling token consumption and inference time.

Method: MARS uses a review process structure with three roles: author agent generates initial solution, reviewer agents provide independent decisions and comments, and meta-reviewer integrates feedback for final decision and revision guidance. This avoids costly reviewer-to-reviewer interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments show MARS matches MAD's accuracy while reducing token usage and inference time by approximately 50% across multiple benchmarks with different LLMs.

Conclusion: MARS provides an efficient multi-agent collaboration framework that maintains reasoning quality while significantly reducing computational costs compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at
https://github.com/xwang97/MARS.

TL;DR: SiniticMTError is a new dataset with error annotations for machine translation from English to Mandarin, Cantonese, and Wu Chinese, providing error spans, types, and severity labels to support MT research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in machine translation remains limited for low-resource languages like Cantonese and Wu Chinese despite their large speaker populations, due to lack of training data and linguistic resources.

Method: Built on existing parallel corpora with rigorous annotation by native speakers, including error span, type, and severity annotations, with analysis of inter-annotator agreement and iterative feedback.

Result: Created a novel dataset that provides detailed error annotations for machine-translated examples across three Sinitic languages, supporting error detection capabilities in MT models.

Conclusion: SiniticMTError serves as a valuable resource for the MT community to advance translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and low-resource language evaluation.

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

### [13] [SwasthLLM: a Unified Cross-Lingual, Multi-Task, and Meta-Learning Zero-Shot Framework for Medical Diagnosis Using Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20567)
*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM is a unified zero-shot cross-lingual framework for medical diagnosis that works across English, Hindi, and Bengali without language-specific fine-tuning, achieving high accuracy through multilingual representation learning and contrastive alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of automatic disease diagnosis in multilingual healthcare environments where annotated medical data is scarce in low-resource languages and linguistic variability exists across populations.

Method: Leverages XLM-RoBERTa encoder with language-aware attention and disease classification head, uses Siamese contrastive learning for cross-lingual alignment, translation consistency module, multi-task learning strategy, and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for rapid adaptation.

Result: Achieves 97.22% accuracy and 97.17% F1-score in supervised settings, and 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% accuracy on Bengali in zero-shot scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization in low-resource contexts.

Conclusion: SwasthLLM effectively addresses multilingual medical diagnosis challenges through robust cross-lingual representation learning, achieving high performance in both supervised and zero-shot settings across multiple languages.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

### [14] [Dynamic Reasoning Chains through Depth-Specialized Mixture-of-Experts in Transformer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20577)
*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DS-MoE is a modular framework that uses depth-specialized mixture of experts to dynamically assemble custom reasoning chains based on input complexity, achieving computational savings and improved reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transformers apply identical processing depth to all inputs, creating inefficiencies where simple queries undergo the same computation as complex problems, wasting resources and limiting reasoning quality.

Method: DS-MoE extends Mixture of Experts from width-based to depth-specialized computation, with expert modules optimized for different reasoning depths (shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical inference, memory integration, meta-cognitive supervision) and a learned routing network that dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains.

Result: DS-MoE achieves up to 16% computational savings, 35% faster inference compared to uniform-depth transformers, and 2.8% higher accuracy on complex multi-step reasoning benchmarks, with interpretable reasoning chains.

Conclusion: DS-MoE represents a significant advancement in adaptive neural architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialized modular processing can simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in large-scale language models.

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRT is a hierarchical transformer that processes language at multiple resolutions using wavelet-inspired architecture, achieving better performance and efficiency than standard transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers misrepresent language hierarchy by processing flat token sequences, leading to quadratic complexity, weak compositional generalization, and poor discourse modeling.

Method: Proposed Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT) with multi-resolution attention that enables bottom-up composition and top-down contextualization using exponential sequence reduction across scales.

Result: HRT outperforms standard transformers by +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, +6.1% on Long Range Arena, with 42% memory reduction and 37% latency improvement compared to BERT/GPT models.

Conclusion: HRT aligns computational structure with language hierarchy through multi-scale processing, achieving both theoretical efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

### [16] [FS-DFM: Fast and Accurate Long Text Generation with Few-Step Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20624)
*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM is a discrete flow-matching model that enables high-quality language generation with only 8 sampling steps instead of hundreds/thousands, achieving 128x faster sampling while maintaining perplexity parity with traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are serial (slow for long sequences) while standard diffusion models require too many iterations (hundreds to thousands), creating a need for fast parallel generation without sacrificing quality.

Method: Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching makes sampling steps an explicit parameter, trains for consistency across step budgets, uses reliable update rules to prevent overshooting, and employs strong teacher guidance distilled from long trajectories.

Result: FS-DFM with 8 steps achieves perplexity parity with 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for 1,024-token generation using similar-size models, delivering 128x faster sampling and significant latency/throughput improvements.

Conclusion: FS-DFM successfully bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion models by enabling fast parallel generation with few steps while maintaining high quality, making it practical for real-world language generation applications.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

*Jungsoo Park,Ethan Mendes,Gabriel Stanovsky,Alan Ritter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRECOG, a corpus for text-only performance forecasting of language models, enabling prediction of model scores from redacted task descriptions without running experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the evaluation bottleneck in LLM development by forecasting model performance before conducting experiments, enabling smarter experiment prioritization.

Method: Curated PRECOG corpus with redacted description-performance pairs, used retrieval-equipped models to predict scores from task descriptions and configurations without dataset access.

Result: Models achieved moderate prediction performance (MAE as low as 8.7 on Accuracy subset) with well-calibrated uncertainty; stronger models showed diverse iterative querying while open-source models lagged.

Conclusion: Text-only performance forecasting is challenging but feasible, offering initial steps toward anticipatory evaluation for difficulty estimation and experiment prioritization.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents methods for building Japanese speech recognizers that output phonemic labels with accent markers for speaking assessment, addressing data sparsity through multitask training and fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Japanese is resource-rich but lacks sufficient training data for accurate phonemic transcriptions with accent marks, which are crucial for speaking assessment tasks.

Method: Two methods: 1) Multitask training with auxiliary loss functions for orthographic text and pitch patterns, 2) Fusion of phonetic alphabet and text token estimators using finite-state transducer framework.

Result: Proposed methods reduced average mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% on CSJ core evaluation sets, outperforming generic multilingual recognizers.

Conclusion: Multitask learning and fusion are effective for building accurate Japanese phonemic recognizers for speaking assessment, with significant error rate reductions.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

*Peng Zhou,Lai Hou Tim,Zhixiang Cheng,Kun Xie,Chaoyi Li,Wei Liu,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework that integrates LLM-extracted knowledge with structural features from pre-trained molecular models to enhance molecular property prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GNNs and self-supervised learning have advanced molecular property prediction, human prior knowledge remains essential. LLMs can extract this knowledge but suffer from gaps and hallucinations, especially for less-studied properties.

Method: Proposes a framework that prompts LLMs to generate domain-relevant knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, then fuses these knowledge-based features with structural representations from pre-trained molecular models using GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1.

Result: Extensive experiments show the integrated method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating that combining LLM-derived knowledge with structural information provides robust and effective molecular property prediction.

Conclusion: The combination of LLM-extracted knowledge and structural features creates a powerful framework for molecular property prediction, addressing limitations of both pure structural models and LLM-only approaches.

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedHerring is a novel attack that makes attack detection models unreliable by modifying text to trigger false attack detections while keeping the classifier correct, creating tension between classifier and detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reliability of attack detection models in NLP systems, as their reliability hasn't been thoroughly studied despite their use in providing additional security checks and human input signals.

Method: Proposed and tested RedHerring attack - modifies text to cause detection models to predict an attack while maintaining classifier correctness. Tested on 4 datasets against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers.

Result: RedHerring successfully drops detection accuracy by 20-71 points while maintaining or improving classifier accuracy. A simple confidence check defense was proposed that requires no retraining and greatly increases detection accuracy.

Conclusion: This novel threat model reveals new ways adversaries can target detection models, highlighting vulnerabilities in current attack detection systems and the need for more robust defenses.

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid and Dynamic Select strategies to reduce query costs in black-box adversarial text attacks by combining BinarySelect and GreedySelect methods, achieving up to 25.82% query reduction while maintaining attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based architectures have increased computational costs for adversarial testing, making existing black-box attack methods inefficient due to high query requirements, especially for researchers with limited GPU resources.

Method: Two new attack selection strategies: Hybrid Select (merges BinarySelect and GreedySelect using size threshold) and Dynamic Select (learns optimal application lengths for each selection method).

Result: Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, sentence-level Hybrid Select reduces required queries per attack by up to 25.82% on average against both encoder models and LLMs, while maintaining attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed selection strategies significantly reduce computational costs of adversarial text attacks without compromising effectiveness, making attack testing more accessible to researchers with limited resources.

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse is a denoised label fusion framework that adapts speech emotion recognition models to target domains using only unlabeled target audio and an API-only large audio-language model, outperforming the LALM by supplementing it with a source-domain trained classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech emotion recognition often fails under domain mismatch in real-world deployments where source data is unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through APIs, creating a need for adaptation methods that don't require source data sharing.

Method: Proposes MI-Fuse framework that uses both LALM and source-domain trained SER classifier as teachers, draws multiple stochastic predictions, weights their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and stabilizes training with exponential moving average teacher.

Result: Experiments across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.9%.

Conclusion: This approach enables realistic adaptation of emotion-aware speech systems without sharing source data, strengthening performance under domain mismatch conditions.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Motivation: Existing unsupervised neural grammar induction models face expressiveness bottlenecks, resulting in unnecessarily large yet underperforming grammars, which limits their practical utility.

Method: The authors analyze when and how probability distribution collapse emerges in neural parameterization components and introduce a targeted collapse-relaxing neural parameterization approach to mitigate this issue.

Result: The proposed approach substantially improves parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact grammars across a wide range of languages, as validated through extensive empirical analysis.

Conclusion: By addressing the fundamental issue of probability distribution collapse, the proposed method achieves better performance with more compact grammars, advancing the state of unsupervised neural grammar induction.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance QA performance across multiple domains without requiring additional training, and to provide insights into how sub-question-answer pairs affect model reasoning reliability.

Method: C2R constructs and refines sub-questions and their answers, curates subsets of sub-QAs to explore diverse reasoning paths, and compares confidence scores of answer candidates to select the final answer.

Result: C2R demonstrates consistent performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks, and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing QA models.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into how sub-QA quantity and quality impact robust reasoning, offering a training-free approach to enhance QA reliability across multiple domains.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SFT on domain-specific data doesn't always hurt general LLM capabilities - using smaller learning rates helps, and Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR) method outperforms other approaches in balancing domain adaptation with general capability preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common belief that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets necessarily degrades LLMs' general capabilities, and to provide both empirical and theoretical understanding of this trade-off.

Method: Evaluated various strategies including smaller learning rates, L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and proposed Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR) method that adaptively reweights loss based on token importance.

Result: Smaller learning rates substantially mitigate general performance degradation while preserving target-domain performance. TALR consistently outperforms other baselines in balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities, though no method completely eliminates the trade-off.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines: (i) use small learning rate for favorable trade-off, (ii) adopt TALR when stronger balance between domain adaptation and general capability preservation is desired.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Atoms Theory to define fundamental units of internal representations in LLMs, addressing limitations of neurons and features. It introduces atomic inner product to correct representation shifting and proves theoretical guarantees for sparse representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of LLM internal representations is limited as fundamental units remain undefined. Neurons suffer from polysemy while features face unreliable reconstruction and instability issues.

Method: Proposed Atoms Theory with atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting. Formally defined atoms and proved conditions for Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Trained threshold-activated sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B models.

Result: Achieved 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers on average. More than 99.8% of atoms satisfied uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features. Scaling experiments revealed link between SAEs size and recovery capacity.

Conclusion: Atoms Theory provides systematic framework for understanding LLM internal representations, showing atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations than neurons or features. Offers foundation for mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Conversational Prompting for personalized review generation under few-shot, training-free constraints, with two variants: SCP (uses user's own reviews) and CCP (adds contrastive examples from other users/LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the real-world challenge of few-shot personalized review generation where extensive user review histories are unavailable and model fine-tuning is infeasible, leveraging LLMs' capabilities in low-resource settings.

Method: Reformulates user reviews as multi-turn conversations. SCP uses only the target user's reviews, while CCP inserts incorrect replies from other users/LLMs and asks the model to correct them to encourage user-specific style.

Result: Both SCP and CCP outperformed conventional non-conversational prompts across 8 product domains and 5 LLMs, producing reviews much closer to target users even with only 2 reviews per user. CCP further improved with high-quality negative examples.

Conclusion: Conversational prompting provides a practical solution for personalized review generation under few-shot and training-free constraints, with SCP remaining competitive when negative examples are unavailable.

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

TL;DR: Enrich-on-Graph (EoG) framework uses LLMs to enrich knowledge graphs, bridging the semantic gap between structured KGs and unstructured queries for improved KGQA performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in KGQA due to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured queries, which existing methods overlook.

Method: Proposes EoG framework that leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, enabling efficient evidence extraction and precise reasoning while maintaining low computational costs and scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets show EoG effectively generates high-quality KGs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EoG successfully bridges the semantic gap in KGQA, providing a flexible, scalable solution that outperforms existing methods while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

### [29] [Leveraging What's Overfixed: Post-Correction via LLM Grammatical Error Overcorrection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20811)
*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO is a novel approach that combines LLMs' overcorrection tendency with sLMs' precision to improve grammatical error correction by first maximizing recall through LLM overcorrection, then refining outputs with targeted post-correction using smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (sLMs) achieve high precision but low recall in grammatical error correction, while Large Language Models (LLMs) show the opposite tendency with high recall but low precision due to overcorrection. The goal is to balance both aspects effectively.

Method: PoCO first intentionally triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall through comprehensive revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step using fine-tuned smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall while maintaining competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical error correction.

Conclusion: PoCO successfully harmonizes the generative power of LLMs with the reliability of smaller supervised models, achieving a balanced approach to grammatical error correction that addresses both recall and precision challenges.

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

*Ukyo Honda,Soichiro Murakami,Peinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cheat-sheet ICL distills many-shot examples into concise summaries, achieving comparable performance with fewer tokens than traditional ICL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many-shot in-context learning requires high computational resources due to long input tokens, creating efficiency challenges.

Method: Propose cheat-sheet ICL that distills information from many-shot examples into concise textual summaries used as context during inference.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches retrieval-based ICL without test-time retrieval.

Conclusion: Cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs in downstream tasks with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

*Shuo Huang,Xingliang Yuan,Gholamreza Haffari,Lizhen Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A zero-shot tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm for privacy-preserving text anonymization that outperforms existing methods while maintaining text utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in LLM services where existing anonymization techniques struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility.

Method: Tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private information through structured search guided by a reward model.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines on privacy-sensitive datasets, achieving superior balance between privacy protection and utility preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot approach effectively protects privacy while maintaining text coherence, relevance, and naturalness.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

### [32] [Concise and Sufficient Sub-Sentence Citations for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20859)
*Guo Chen,Qiuyuan Li,Qiuxian Li,Hongliang Dai,Xiang Chen,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes sub-sentence citations in RAG systems to improve verifiability by providing more precise and sufficient attribution at finer granularity than sentence or paragraph level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods produce citations at sentence/paragraph level which may include irrelevant content or omit essential verification information, forcing users to read surrounding context.

Method: Developed annotation guidelines and dataset for sub-sentence citations, then created an attribution framework using LLMs to generate fine-tuning data and a credit model to filter low-quality examples.

Result: Experiments show the proposed approach generates high-quality and more readable citations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Sub-sentence citations provide more concise and sufficient attribution, reducing user effort to verify LLM outputs in RAG question answering systems.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeFT is a weighted supervised fine-tuning method for diffusion language models that assigns different weights to tokens based on their entropy, achieving significant improvements over standard SFT on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong potential in language modeling with faster generation, but applying supervised fine-tuning is challenging due to lack of precise probability estimates and inconsistent generation process, highlighting the need to control key tokens that guide generation direction.

Method: Proposed WeFT, a weighted SFT method for diffusion language models where tokens are assigned different weights based on their entropy, derived from diffusion theory.

Result: WeFT achieved relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard SFT on four reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500) when trained on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from open-r1.

Conclusion: WeFT effectively addresses the challenges of SFT for diffusion language models by weighting tokens based on entropy, leading to substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

### [34] [Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20866)
*Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Natpatchara Pongjirapat,Krittaphas Chaisutyakorn,Piyalitt Ittichaiwong,Tossaporn Saengja,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies how to enable medical reasoning models to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions, proposing prompting and fine-tuning approaches with new reward functions for ranked-list formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making relies on considering multiple options rather than single answers to reduce risks of narrow perspectives, but current medical reasoning models are typically trained to produce only one answer even in open-ended settings.

Method: The authors investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning). They propose new reward functions specifically targeted at ranked-list answer formats and conduct ablation studies for reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: While some supervised fine-tuning models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with reinforcement fine-tuning are more robust across multiple formats. The models can recognize valid answers even when they fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling medical reasoning models to generate ranked lists of answers, providing a foundation for developing alternative answer formats that are more beneficial than single answers in medical domains.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SummQ is a novel adversarial multi-agent framework for long document summarization that uses collaborative intelligence between summarization and quizzing agents to address information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues in existing LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with long document summarization due to information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence problems when processing excessively long documents.

Method: Adversarial multi-agent framework with specialized agents: summary generators and reviewers for creating/evaluating summaries, quiz generators and reviewers for creating comprehension questions, and an examinee agent that validates whether summaries contain information needed to answer quiz questions, enabling iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new approach for long document summarization using adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality, with comprehensive analyses revealing the effectiveness of multi-agent collaboration dynamics and quizzing mechanisms.

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemLens detects LLM memorization by analyzing probability trajectories of numeric tokens, showing contaminated samples lock onto answers early while clean samples accumulate evidence gradually.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods relying on lexical overlap and perplexity have low generalization and degrade with implicitly contaminated data, creating need for better memorization detection.

Method: Analyze probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation, showing contaminated samples exhibit 'shortcut' behaviors with early answer locking, while clean samples show gradual evidence accumulation across model layers.

Result: Contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct, well-separated reasoning trajectories. Validation through LoRA fine-tuning with injected samples shows same trajectory patterns as naturally contaminated data.

Conclusion: MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in detecting LLM contamination.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [37] [Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916)
*Krishna Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether sentence-level memory load is better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by structural density of intervening material, proposing Intervener Complexity as a refinement to linear distance measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality in sentence comprehension by examining whether structural density (number of intervening heads) offers better explanatory power for memory load than linear distance alone.

Method: Used harmonized dependency treebanks and mixed-effects modeling across multiple languages to evaluate sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of memory load, operationalized as the sum of feature misbinding and feature interference.

Result: All three factors were positively associated with memory load, with sentence length having the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity providing explanatory power beyond linear distance measures.

Conclusion: The findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives by treating dependency length as a surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration demands, demonstrating how UD-based graph measures and cross-linguistic modeling can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency.

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

*Asim Ersoy,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar,Kareem Darwish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates tool calling capabilities for Arabic language in LLMs, examining data requirements, instruction tuning effects, and fine-tuning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research and resources for tool calling are predominantly English-centric, creating a gap for other languages like Arabic. The paper aims to understand how to enable tool calling functionality for Arabic.

Method: Extensive experiments using base and post-trained variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. Translated and adapted two open-source tool-calling datasets into Arabic to address resource gaps.

Result: Findings provide crucial insights into optimal strategies for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Conclusion: The study bridges the resource gap and offers guidance on data requirements and training approaches for Arabic tool calling capabilities.

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively evaluate academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics, with Reference Aided Evaluation (using correct answers as guides) performing best compared to human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics, as LLMs have shown potential as evaluators and educational assistants.

Method: Proposed five evaluation systems tested on 110 computer science answers using JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B models: JudgeLM evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation, No Reference Evaluation, Additive Evaluation, and Adaptive Evaluation.

Result: Reference Aided Evaluation performed best with lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and root mean square deviation (1.214) compared to human evaluation, providing fair scoring and insightful evaluations. Other methods failed with concise answers or lacked necessary information.

Conclusion: AI-driven automatic evaluation systems with proper methodologies show potential as complementary tools to academic resources, with Reference Aided Evaluation being the most effective approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The causal mask in Transformer decoders provides positional information and induces position-dependent attention patterns that favor nearby query-key pairs, similar to explicit positional encodings. The interaction between causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention patterns into non-relative ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of causal mask as a source of positional information in Transformer decoders, alongside explicit positional encodings like RoPE, and to analyze how they interact.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving causal mask induces position-dependent attention patterns, and empirical analysis examining trained models to confirm these patterns and their interaction with RoPE.

Result: Causal mask induces position-dependent attention patterns favoring nearby pairs, and its interaction with RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention patterns into non-relative ones. This effect is consistently observed in modern large language models.

Conclusion: The causal mask should be considered as an important source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings, as it significantly influences attention patterns and interacts with methods like RoPE.

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two benchmarks (ManyIFEval and StyleMBPP) to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously, showing performance degrades with more instructions, and develops regression models to efficiently estimate performance on unseen instruction combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in real-world scenarios, it's crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously, which is computationally impractical to evaluate exhaustively.

Method: Created two specialized benchmarks: ManyIFEval for text generation (up to 10 instructions) and StyleMBPP for code generation (up to 6 instructions). Developed three types of regression models to estimate performance on unseen instruction combinations.

Result: Performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions increases across ten LLMs. A logistic regression model using instruction count can predict performance with approximately 10% error for unseen instruction combinations. Modest sample sizes (500 for ManyIFEval, 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarks and regression models enable efficient evaluation of LLMs' multiple instruction-following capabilities, addressing the computational impracticality of exhaustive testing while providing reliable performance estimation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

<details>

Motivation: Foundation models have shown capabilities in various domains but their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely unexplored, creating a need for rigorous evaluation in scientific and engineering contexts.

Method: Created SoM-1K dataset with 1,065 annotated strength of materials problems containing both text and diagrams, and proposed Descriptions of Images (DoI) prompting strategy that provides expert-generated text descriptions of visual diagrams as context.

Result: Current foundation models struggle significantly with engineering problems, with best-performing model achieving only 56.6% accuracy. LLMs with DoI often outperform VLMs with visual diagrams, and DoI helps mitigate visual misinterpretation errors.

Conclusion: This work establishes a rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights the critical need for developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models, particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [44] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit culture positioning bias by defaulting to mainstream US perspectives and treating other cultures as outsiders. The paper proposes CultureLens benchmark and agent-based mitigation methods to address this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address the subtle fairness issues in LLMs where they perpetuate cultural biases by positioning their generations from mainstream US perspectives while treating non-mainstream cultures as outsiders.

Method: Proposed CultureLens benchmark with 4000 prompts and 3 metrics for cultural bias evaluation through interview script generation task. Developed two mitigation methods: FIP (prompt-based) and MFA framework with single-agent (self-reflection) and multi-agent (specialized agents for planning, critique, and refinement) pipelines.

Result: Evaluation on 5 SOTA LLMs revealed models adopt insider tones in over 88% of US-contexted scripts but disproportionately use outsider stances for less dominant cultures. Agent-based mitigation methods showed effectiveness in reducing cultural biases.

Conclusion: Agent-based methods are a promising direction for mitigating cultural biases in generative LLMs, with structured multi-agent frameworks proving particularly effective for producing unbiased cultural content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

### [45] [PerHalluEval: Persian Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21104)
*Mohammad Hosseini,Kimia Hosseini,Shayan Bali,Zahra Zanjani,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval is the first Persian hallucination evaluation benchmark that uses an LLM-driven pipeline and human validation to detect hallucinations in QA and summarization tasks, showing LLMs struggle with Persian text hallucination detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination is a persistent issue in LLMs, especially for low-resource languages like Persian, where there's a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Three-stage LLM-driven pipeline augmented with human validation, using log probabilities to select believable hallucinated instances, and human annotation for Persian-specific cultural contexts.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs showed they generally struggle with detecting hallucinated Persian text. External knowledge (original documents) partially mitigates hallucination, and Persian-specific training doesn't significantly reduce hallucination.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges with Persian hallucination detection, and while external knowledge helps, specialized training for Persian doesn't provide substantial benefits in reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

### [46] [BESPOKE: Benchmark for Search-Augmented Large Language Model Personalization via Diagnostic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21106)
*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE is a realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in search-augmented LLMs, addressing the gap in systematic evaluation of personalized information-seeking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search-augmented LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini attempt personalization but lack systematic evaluation. The same query can reflect different intents across users, requiring personalized responses in preferred forms.

Method: BESPOKE is constructed through long-term human annotation where annotators contribute their own chat/search histories, author queries with detailed information needs, and evaluate responses with fine-grained preference scores and diagnostic feedback.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic analyses that reveal key requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks.

Conclusion: BESPOKE provides a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized search-augmented LLMs, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [47] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ is a spoken extension of the BBQ bias benchmark that evaluates social bias in Spoken Language Models (SLMs) from both content and acoustic aspects by converting text contexts into controlled voice conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure social bias in Spoken Language Models that can emerge from both content (textual) and acoustic (voice characteristics) aspects, which traditional text-based benchmarks cannot capture.

Method: Converted every BBQ context into controlled voice conditions to enable per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores comparable to the original text benchmark, then evaluated two SLMs (LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio) using this dataset.

Result: Found architectural contrasts: LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias but amplifies gender and accent bias, while Qwen2-Audio dampens these cues while preserving content fidelity.

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [48] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechLMs exhibit paradoxical gender bias patterns: they show male-oriented responses in gender-stereotypical questions but fail to differentiate when gender context is appropriate, primarily due to Whisper speech encoders generating male-oriented acoustic tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze acoustic-based gender differentiation in SpeechLMs where identical questions lead to different responses based on speaker's gender, despite general fairness principles.

Method: Created a dataset of 9,208 speech samples across Gender-Independent, Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent categories. Evaluated LLaMA-Omni series models and compared SpeechLMs with backbone LLMs to identify bias sources.

Result: Models showed paradoxical patterns: consistent male-oriented responses in Gender-Stereotypical questions, but gender-independent responses in Gender-Dependent questions where differentiation would be appropriate. This pattern persists even with neutral options and gender neutralization, primarily stemming from Whisper speech encoders generating male-oriented acoustic tokens.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLMs fail to properly utilize gender information, prioritizing general fairness over contextual appropriateness, revealing the need for more sophisticated techniques to handle gender information in speech technology.

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

### [50] [Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151)
*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROC reformulates multimodal relation extraction as a retrieval task using relation semantics, integrating entity types and positional information, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal relation extraction approaches use classification-based paradigms with fused features, which overlook structural constraints like entity types and positional cues, and lack semantic expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding.

Method: Proposes Retrieval Over Classification (ROC) framework that: 1) integrates entity type and positional information through multimodal encoder, 2) expands relation labels into natural language descriptions using LLM, and 3) aligns entity-relation pairs via semantic similarity-based contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets MNRE and MORE, and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: ROC successfully addresses limitations of classification-based multimodal RE by reformulating it as a retrieval task driven by relation semantics, demonstrating superior performance and enhanced capabilities.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

### [51] [Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntactic-Domain Spurious Correlations in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21155)
*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can develop spurious correlations between syntactic patterns and domains, which can override semantic understanding and be exploited to bypass safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs associate syntactic templates with domains, potentially leading to spurious correlations that override semantic understanding and affect model performance and safety.

Method: Used synthetic training datasets to study syntactic-domain correlations, developed an evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon, and conducted case studies on safety finetuning implications.

Result: Found that syntactic-domain correlations lower performance on entity knowledge tasks (mean 0.51 +/- 0.06) and can be used to bypass refusals in safety-finetuned models like OLMo-2-7B Instruct and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: There is a need to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations and ensure syntactic diversity in training data within domains to prevent spurious correlations.

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys computational humor in NLP, focusing on generation and explanation tasks, and finds that current models still lag behind human capabilities despite humor being a fundamental human trait.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humour is a fundamental human trait that requires extensive reasoning and common-sense knowledge, making it an ideal task to assess the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing.

Method: The paper conducts a literature survey of computational humour research, specifically focusing on generative tasks of humour creation and explanation, and analyzes the current state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: Despite humour understanding being a foundational NLP task, research on generating and explaining humour beyond puns remains limited, and current state-of-the-art models continue to perform below human capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of computational humour processing as a key NLP subdiscipline and provides extensive discussion of future research directions that account for the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

### [53] [GEP: A GCG-Based method for extracting personally identifiable information from chatbots built on small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21192)
*Jieli Zhu,Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates PII (personally identifiable information) leakage in small language models (SLMs) for medical chatbots, proposing a new attack method called GEP that significantly outperforms previous template-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models are becoming popular due to their comparable performance to large language models with less resource consumption, but their PII leakage risks in downstream tasks remain unexplored, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: The authors first fine-tuned ChatBioGPT based on BioGPT using medical datasets, then proposed GEP (greedy coordinate gradient-based method) for PII extraction, which is specifically designed for SLMs and tested against template-based and free-style insertion scenarios.

Result: GEP achieved up to 60x more PII leakage compared to previous template-based methods, and maintained a 4.53% leakage rate even in complex free-style insertion scenarios where PII appears in various syntactic expressions.

Conclusion: SLMs are vulnerable to PII leakage attacks, and the proposed GEP method effectively exposes these vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for better privacy protection measures in small language model deployments, particularly in sensitive applications like medical chatbots.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework combining implicit retrieval and structured collaboration to overcome bottlenecks in LLM scientific reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two major bottlenecks in LLM scientific reasoning: (1) explicit retrieval fragments reasoning and imposes a "tool tax" of extra tokens and steps, and (2) multi-agent pipelines dilute strong solutions by averaging across all candidates.

Method: Monitor-based retrieval module operating at token level for implicit knowledge integration, combined with Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) where candidates repair each other, and Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) that adapts refinement to solution quality.

Result: Achieved 48.3% accuracy on Humanity's Last Exam Bio/Chem Gold (highest reported), surpassing strongest agent baseline by 13.4 points and frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while reducing token usage by 53.5% and agent steps by 43.7%. Results confirmed on SuperGPQA and TRQA.

Conclusion: Implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Error analysis shows reasoning failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85% of cases, and diversity analysis reveals retrieval tasks benefit from solution variety while reasoning tasks favor consensus.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLaw is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Chinese legal knowledge, comprising a comprehensive statute corpus and case-based reasoning tasks, revealing significant limitations in LLMs' ability to accurately retrieve and apply legal provisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for legal analysis but their reliability is compromised by general pre-training that lacks specialized legal focus, making it difficult to assess their true legal knowledge depth.

Method: Created CLaw benchmark with two components: (1) comprehensive corpus of 306 Chinese national statutes segmented to subparagraph level with historical revisions (64,849 entries), and (2) 254 case-based reasoning instances from China Supreme Court materials.

Result: Most contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal provisions, critically undermining their reliability for legal reasoning due to inaccurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions.

Conclusion: Trustworthy legal reasoning in LLMs requires robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval (enhanced through SFT or RAG) and strong general reasoning capabilities. CLaw provides essential benchmark for advancing domain-specific LLM reasoning in legal sphere.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

*Yaxiong Wu,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem (Sentence Graph Memory) is a memory management system for long-term conversational agents that organizes dialogue into sentence-level graphs across different granularities, improving context retrieval and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory methods based on fact extraction or summarization struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across different granularities of dialogue, making them ineffective for long-term conversational agents that need to handle dialogue histories exceeding LLM context windows.

Method: SGMem represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and session-level contexts. It combines retrieved raw dialogue with generated memory (summaries, facts, insights) to supply LLMs with coherent and relevant context.

Result: Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Conclusion: SGMem provides an effective memory management solution for long-term conversational agents by organizing dialogue information across multiple granularities and combining raw dialogue with generated memory to enhance context relevance and response quality.

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

*Yaxiong Wu,Jianyuan Bo,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCG-RAG is a query-centric graph RAG framework that solves the granularity dilemma in graph-based retrieval by enabling query-granular indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval, outperforming existing methods in multi-hop reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods face a granularity dilemma where fine-grained entity-level graphs have high token costs and lose context, while coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations needed for effective multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Uses Doc2Query and Doc2Query-- to construct query-centric graphs with controllable granularity, then employs a tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism to select relevant chunks via generated queries.

Result: Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG datasets show QCG-RAG consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in question answering accuracy.

Conclusion: QCG-RAG establishes a new paradigm for multi-hop reasoning by providing a query-centric approach that improves graph quality and interpretability while maintaining efficient retrieval.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

*Evgeny Kaskov,Elizaveta Petrova,Petr Surovtsev,Anna Kostikova,Ilya Mistiurin,Alexander Kapitanov,Alexander Nagaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses homonym duplication in diffusion models, where words with identical spelling but different meanings cause models to generate multiple senses simultaneously. The authors develop methods to measure duplication rates and evaluate different models using both automated VLM-based evaluation and human assessment. They also explore prompt expansion as a mitigation strategy that helps reduce duplication issues related to Anglocentric bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homonyms (words with identical spelling but distinct meanings) create challenges for generative models, causing diffusion models to generate multiple senses simultaneously. This problem is exacerbated by Anglocentric bias in text-to-image pipelines, where non-English words may become homonyms after translation to English, leading to loss of original meaning.

Method: The authors introduce a method for measuring homonym duplication rates and conduct evaluations using both automatic evaluation with Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. They investigate prompt expansion as a mitigation technique to reduce duplication problems.

Result: The research demonstrates that prompt expansion effectively reduces homonym duplication issues, including those related to Anglocentric bias. The automatic evaluation pipeline has been made publicly available.

Conclusion: Homonym duplication is a significant issue in diffusion models that can be effectively measured and mitigated through prompt expansion techniques. The proposed methods help address both direct homonym problems and those arising from Anglocentric bias in translation pipelines.

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

### [59] [LLM Output Homogenization is Task Dependent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21267)
*Shomik Jain,Jack Lanchantin,Maximilian Nickel,Karen Ullrich,Ashia Wilson,Jamelle Watson-Daniels*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses output response homogenization in LLMs by proposing a task-dependent approach to evaluate and mitigate it, introducing task-anchored functional diversity and sampling techniques that increase diversity where needed without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to output homogenization fail to consider task-dependent conceptualizations of diversity, where homogenization may be desirable in some tasks (like math) but problematic in others (like creative writing).

Method: Developed a task taxonomy with 8 categories, introduced task-anchored functional diversity evaluation, and proposed task-anchored sampling technique that selectively increases diversity based on task requirements.

Result: The approach successfully increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is undesired while preserving it where desired, challenging the perceived diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: Task dependence significantly improves the evaluation and mitigation of output homogenization in LLMs, enabling more nuanced approaches that maintain response quality while addressing diversity concerns appropriately.

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

*Irina Tolstykh,Aleksandra Tsybina,Sergey Yakubson,Maksim Kuprashevich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMTrace is a new large-scale bilingual corpus for AI-generated text detection that addresses limitations in existing datasets by providing character-level annotations for precise localization of AI-generated segments in mixed human-AI authorship scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI text detection systems lack suitable training data - existing datasets use outdated models, are mostly English-only, and don't handle mixed human-AI authorship with character-level precision needed for localizing AI-generated segments.

Method: Created LLMTrace corpus using diverse modern proprietary and open-source LLMs, designed as a bilingual (English and Russian) dataset with character-level annotations to support both traditional binary classification and novel AI-generated interval detection.

Result: Developed a comprehensive dataset that enables training and evaluation of more nuanced AI detection models capable of precisely identifying AI-generated segments within mixed authorship texts.

Conclusion: LLMTrace serves as a vital resource for advancing AI text detection by addressing critical gaps in training data and supporting the development of more practical detection systems for real-world mixed authorship scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes how input perturbations affect Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs, deriving an upper bound for perturbations that maintains acceptable output fluctuation and proving key relationships between perturbation tolerance and reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research shows CoT outputs are sensitive to input perturbations, but lacks theoretical understanding of how perturbations propagate during reasoning, limiting improvements in prompt optimization methods.

Method: Theoretical analysis deriving an upper bound for input perturbations, proving relationships with reasoning steps, and applying findings to Linear Self-Attention model as a simplified Transformer.

Result: Proved that: (i) perturbation upper bound is positively correlated with number of reasoning steps; (ii) infinite reasoning cannot eliminate perturbation impact; (iii) for LSA model, bound is negatively correlated with input embedding and hidden state norms. Experimental validation on 3 datasets and 4 models confirmed theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundation for understanding perturbation effects on CoT reasoning, showing both limitations and relationships that can guide future prompt optimization methods.

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

*Kin Ian Lo,Hala Hawashin,Mina Abbaszadeh,Tilen Limback-Stokin,Hadi Wazni,Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP is a multimodal encoder that combines CLIP with a tensor network text encoder to explicitly encode syntactic structure, improving compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks while being parameter-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often fail on tasks requiring understanding of word order and predicate-argument structure due to neglecting compositional language structure.

Method: Combines frozen CLIP vision transformer with novel tensor network text encoder that uses Combinatory Categorial Grammar parsing to create distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror grammatical derivation, with tensor decompositions for efficiency.

Result: Improves CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on SVO-Swap benchmark.

Conclusion: Embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: Updesh is a large-scale synthetic instruction-following dataset for 13 Indian languages created using bottom-up generation from Wikipedia content, achieving significant performance gains especially in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing effective multilingual AI systems in low-resource settings, particularly for culturally grounded applications where synthetic data effectiveness remains underexplored.

Method: Bottom-up generation strategy using large open-source LLMs (>=235B parameters) to ground data generation in language-specific Wikipedia content, creating culturally contextualized datasets.

Result: Created Updesh dataset with 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages. Models trained on Updesh achieved significant gains on generative tasks and remained competitive on multiple-choice NLU tasks, with most pronounced improvements in low and medium-resource languages.

Conclusion: Effective multilingual AI requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies, as demonstrated by the success of the bottom-up approach in narrowing performance gaps between resource levels.

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

*Daniel Vennemeyer,Phan Anh Duong,Tiffany Zhan,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that sycophantic behaviors in LLMs (agreement and praise) are encoded as distinct linear directions in latent space that can be independently controlled, suggesting they arise from separate mechanisms rather than a single process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether sycophantic behaviors in LLMs (excessive agreement and flattery) stem from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes, and to decompose these behaviors systematically.

Method: Used difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry analysis across multiple models and datasets to examine the latent representations of sycophantic behaviors.

Result: Found that sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement are encoded along distinct linear directions; each behavior can be independently amplified or suppressed without affecting others; and this representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.

Conclusion: Sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct, independently steerable representations in LLMs, suggesting they are separate mechanisms that can be individually controlled.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLBFF combines human preferences with rule-based verification to create more interpretable and versatile reward models for LLM alignment, outperforming traditional RLHF and RLVR approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF lacks interpretability and suffers from reward hacking due to subjective human judgments, while RLVR is limited to correctness-based verification. RLBFF aims to combine the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Extracts binary principles from natural language feedback (e.g., accuracy: yes/no) and trains reward models as entailment tasks where responses satisfy or don't satisfy arbitrary principles.

Result: Achieves top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 leaderboard). Aligns Qwen3-32B to match/exceed o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 at <5% inference cost.

Conclusion: RLBFF provides a more interpretable and customizable approach to LLM alignment that combines human preference flexibility with rule-based precision, enabling better performance at lower cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using next-token probabilities (NTPs) from vision-language models as features for lightweight ML models to detect hallucinations, achieving performance comparable to VLMs while being more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in VLMs undermine reliability, and current detection methods using VLMs themselves are computationally intensive and increase latency.

Method: Train traditional ML models using NTP-based features from VLMs, which quantify model uncertainty, and augment with linguistic NTPs and VLM hallucination scores.

Result: NTP-based features are effective predictors of hallucinations, enabling simple ML models to match VLM performance. Augmentation with linguistic NTPs and VLM scores further improves detection.

Conclusion: NTP-based lightweight methods provide efficient hallucination detection comparable to VLMs, paving the way for more reliable VLM systems.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

TL;DR: A quasi-synthetic data generation framework using Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices for offline handwritten signature verification, achieving low error rates in writer-independent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline handwritten signature verification is challenging in writer-independent settings, and existing methods depend on real-world datasets. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces.

Method: Uses Riemannian Gaussian Mixture on SPD matrices to generate synthetic writers and their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling creates positive and negative synthetic SPD populations, followed by metric learning with similar/dissimilar pairs.

Result: Experiments on Western and Asian signature datasets show low error rates under intra- and cross-dataset evaluation protocols, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The quasi-synthetic approach shows strong potential for writer-independent signature verification by generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces, reducing dependency on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

Method: Developed efficient diffusion transformer with powerful VAE that reduces image tokens, pretrained on billions of text-image pairs, incorporated fine-tuned VLM for multimodal post-training, and used inference acceleration techniques including adversarial distillation, distribution matching, quantization, and speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing, generates native high-resolution images (1K-4K) with inference time of 1.8 seconds for 2K images, demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks including precise editing and in-context reasoning.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 successfully extends traditional T2I systems into an interactive multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundaries of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image

strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

### [70] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Contrastive Learning framework for breast cancer detection using ResNet-50 trained with semi-supervised approach on mammogram data, achieving 96.7% accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a major global health concern, and early detection is crucial for better treatment outcomes. While deep learning methods show promise, they face accuracy challenges due to limited labeled datasets for training.

Method: A Contrastive Learning framework using ResNet-50 trained in semi-supervised approach with similarity index on large unlabeled mammogram data, enhanced with various augmentations and transformations, then fine-tuned on small labeled datasets.

Result: The proposed method achieved 96.7% accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Contrastive Learning framework effectively addresses the limited labeled data problem in breast cancer detection and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (FMs) fail on real-world industrial quality inspection tasks despite performing well on public benchmarks, highlighting a gap between academic performance and practical industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Foundation Models' zero-shot generalization capabilities for automated quality inspection in manufacturing, replacing tedious labeling tasks and enabling cross-product model reuse, which would be more efficient than supervised AI models.

Method: Tested multiple recent Foundation Models on both custom real-world industrial image data and public benchmark datasets to evaluate their performance in zero-shot quality inspection scenarios.

Result: All tested Foundation Models failed on real-world industrial image data, while performing well on public benchmark datasets, revealing a significant performance gap between academic benchmarks and practical industrial applications.

Conclusion: Current Foundation Models are not yet suitable for real-world industrial quality inspection despite their promising zero-shot capabilities, indicating the need for further development to bridge the gap between academic performance and industrial practicality.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes a universal Neural Space (NS) with encoder-decoder framework that pre-computes features across vision tasks, enabling multiple AI modules to share the same feature space for efficient multi-task pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are customized for specific high-precision tasks, which is inefficient for applications with modular tasks requiring mapping into disparate latent domains.

Method: Lightweight CNN-based encoder-decoder framework that learns transformation-aware, generalizable representations to create a shared feature space for multiple downstream AI modules.

Result: Reduces redundancy, improves generalization across domain shifts, and enables efficient execution of imaging/vision tasks like demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation in the Neural Space.

Conclusion: The Neural Space architecture establishes a foundation for efficient multi-task vision pipelines with better hardware compatibility compared to larger transformer backbones.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a strategy for selecting the most useful training images for edge camera systems to maximize model quality while minimizing transmission costs, using high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge camera systems need regular model updates but face computational limitations and transmission costs when training smaller models using annotations from central server teacher models.

Method: High-confidence stream-based strategy combined with diversity-based approach for image selection, focusing on minimizing dataset queries while maintaining training iterations.

Result: The proposed approach produces high-quality models with minimal dataset queries for similar training load compared to other methods.

Conclusion: Combining high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity-based approaches is effective for training edge models efficiently while minimizing transmission costs.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON is an instruction-following virtual try-on system that uses natural language instructions to control garment styling, eliminating the need for manual mask creation and enabling complex styling scenarios that traditional masking approaches can't handle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on systems rely on binary masks for layout control, which are difficult to create, require background knowledge, and cannot handle complex styling scenarios like changing sleeve positions. There's a need for a more intuitive system that can understand natural language instructions.

Method: InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models to automatically generate binary masks based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. It formulates virtual try-on as an image-guided inpainting task and automates multiple rounds of image generation.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art results with styling control and is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models. It simplifies the user experience by removing the need for precisely drawn masks.

Conclusion: InstructVTON provides a more intuitive and powerful virtual try-on system that can handle complex styling scenarios through natural language instructions, overcoming limitations of traditional masking-based approaches while maintaining compatibility with existing models.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet is a deep learning model for recognizing altered fingerprints using VGG16 backbone and cosine similarity, achieving high accuracy (96.7-99.54%) on real altered fingerprint datasets with strict thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Altered fingerprint recognition is challenging in biometric verification applications like border control and forensics, where adversaries deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection, making robust recognition essential.

Method: Uses a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings, evaluated on SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Result: With strict thresholds, achieves accuracies of 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels respectively. Threshold-sensitivity study shows sharp degradation (7.86-29.51%) when threshold is relaxed from 0.92 to 0.72.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations, demonstrates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical, and highlights the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: To enhance bimanual robotic manipulation by incorporating semantic attention cues from pre-trained vision models into 3D voxel representations.

Method: Extract attention maps from DINOv2 Vision Transformer, interpret as pixel-level saliency scores, lift into 3D voxel grid, and integrate into behavior cloning policy.

Result: 8.2% absolute improvement and 21.9% relative gain across all tasks in RLBench bimanual benchmark when integrated into state-of-the-art voxel-based policy.

Conclusion: Attention-guided featurization using pre-trained vision models significantly enhances robotic manipulation performance by providing semantic cues in 3D space.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study presents a comprehensive benchmark analysis of 36 real-time object detection models (YOLO v8-v12 and RT-DETR v1-v2 families) for blueberry detection, evaluated on a new dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labeled instances. The models were further enhanced using semi-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blueberry detection in natural environments is challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur. Deep learning detectors require large-scale diverse datasets and optimal accuracy/speed/memory trade-offs for practical deployment.

Method: Comparative analysis of 36 model variants on a new blueberry dataset (661 images, 85,879 instances). Models were fine-tuned using Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning on 1,035 unlabeled images from a ground-based machine vision platform.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved 93.3% mAP@50, RT-DETRv2-X achieved 93.6% mAP@50. After SSL fine-tuning, RT-DETR-v2-X achieved the best performance of 94.8% mAP@50. Mid-sized models offered the best accuracy-speed balance.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable benchmark for blueberry detection, with RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the highest accuracy after SSL. More research is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data through SSL. Both dataset and software are publicly available.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset

*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight ROI augmentation strategy for mammography classification that probabilistically replaces full images with random ROI crops during training, showing modest performance improvements without inference-time costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for mammogram interpretation is limited by small datasets and resolution constraints, requiring data-centric approaches to enhance performance without additional labels or architectural changes.

Method: ROI augmentation during training where full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops from a precomputed bounding-box bank, with optional jitter for variability. Evaluated with patient-level cross-validation.

Result: Modest ROC-AUC gains (best with p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10), varying performance across folds, flat to slightly lower PR-AUC. Training efficiency maintained with no inference-time cost increase.

Conclusion: Simple ROI augmentation strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method that uses mirror reflections in single images to create multi-view stereo setups, enabling 3D reconstruction from single captures by treating reflections as virtual cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo information within a single capture, allowing the real and reflected virtual views to be visible simultaneously.

Method: The method treats mirror reflections as auxiliary views and designs a transformation to construct physically valid virtual cameras, enabling direct pixel-domain generation of virtual views. It also proposes a symmetric-aware loss to refine pose estimation and extends to dynamic scenes.

Result: The framework enables efficient per-frame geometry recovery in dynamic scenes and is compatible with feed-forward reconstruction models for generalizable 3D reconstruction. A synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes with ground-truth data is provided for evaluation.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of using mirror reflections for 3D reconstruction from single images, simplifying the imaging process while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack is a street-level, language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels and analyzes facade attributes to determine building occupancy after disasters, achieving high precision and recall scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building-level occupancy assessment after disasters is crucial for emergency response but current methods using overhead imagery miss important facade details, while street-view imagery is sparse and hard to align with parcels.

Method: A street-level framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and analyzes interpretable attributes using two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design separating perception from conservative reasoning.

Result: The two-stage approach achieved precision of 0.927, recall of 0.781, and F-1 score of 0.848, outperforming the one-stage baseline (precision 0.943, recall 0.728, F-1 score 0.822) in post-Hurricane Helene surveys.

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments with intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics for targeted quality control, suitable for integration into emergency management workflows.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use semantic representations alongside visual features to recognize social interactions in moving shapes. Semantic models, especially verb-based embeddings from descriptions, best explain human similarity judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what semantic representations humans use to complement visual features when recognizing social interactions from simple moving shapes.

Method: Study 1: Direct labeling of animations by participants. Study 2: Measuring representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments and comparing with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings.

Result: Human responses were distributed in Study 1. Semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in explaining human judgments. Verb-based embeddings from descriptions accounted for human similarity judgments the best.

Conclusion: Social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract representations.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGS is a novel cross-view geo-localization framework that uses E(2)-Steerable CNN and graph-based global-local consistency to improve robustness against viewpoint variations and enhance cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-view geo-localization: (1) achieving robustness under severe appearance variations from different UAV orientations and fields of view, and (2) establishing reliable correspondences that capture both global semantics and local details for better cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes EGS framework with two key components: (1) E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable features under rotation and viewpoint shifts, and (2) graph with virtual super-node that connects to all local nodes to aggregate global semantics and redistribute to local regions, enforcing global-local consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks show EGS consistently achieves substantial performance gains and establishes new state-of-the-art in cross-domain cross-view geo-localization.

Conclusion: EGS effectively enhances cross-domain generalization in cross-view geo-localization by combining rotation-invariant feature extraction with global-local consistency modeling, demonstrating superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection that separates edge enhancement and semantic modeling using bidirectional attention and multi-scale edge refinement to address feature misalignment in cluttered backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets lack distinctive features and easily blend into noisy backgrounds, creating a conflict between capturing spatial details for small targets and extracting semantic context for larger ones, which existing methods with fixed gradient operators fail to address adequately.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Path Edge Network with two complementary paths: 1) Bidirectional Interaction Module using Local and Global Self-Attention for multi-scale feature dependencies, and 2) Multi-Edge Refiner using cascaded Taylor finite difference operators with attention gating for precise edge localization at multiple scales.

Result: The method provides precise infrared small target detection and localization by effectively combining structural semantics and edge refinement while suppressing noise in cluttered backgrounds.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-path approach offers a promising solution that unifies edge enhancement and semantic modeling, addressing the fundamental challenge of feature misalignment in infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Group Intention Forecasting (GIF) to predict when collective intentions emerge from individual actions, presents the SHOT dataset for basketball scenarios, and proposes the GIFT framework for modeling group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intention recognition focuses on individual intentions but overlooks the complexities of collective intentions in group settings, creating a gap in understanding how shared goals emerge from multiple individuals' actions.

Method: The authors propose SHOT dataset with 1,979 basketball video clips from 5 camera views, annotated with 6 individual attributes, and introduce GIFT framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both SHOT dataset and GIFT framework, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the limitation of traditional intention recognition by focusing on collective intentions, providing both a comprehensive dataset and effective framework for forecasting when group intentions will emerge.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neptune-X is a data-centric generative-selection framework that addresses maritime object detection challenges by generating diverse synthetic maritime scenes and intelligently selecting task-relevant samples to improve detection accuracy, especially in underrepresented scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces challenges due to scarce annotated data and poor generalization across different maritime attributes, with models underperforming in underrepresented scenarios like open-sea environments.

Method: Proposes Neptune-X framework with two components: 1) X-to-Maritime generative model with Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module for realistic scene synthesis, and 2) Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for dynamic selection of task-relevant synthetic samples.

Result: The approach sets new benchmarks in maritime scene synthesis and significantly improves detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.

Conclusion: Neptune-X effectively addresses maritime data scarcity and generalization issues through synthetic data generation and intelligent sample selection, demonstrating improved detection performance across diverse maritime scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

*Sofia McLeod,Chee-Kheng Chng,Matthew Rodda,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STELLA is the first end-to-end Crater-Based Navigation pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions, achieving metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracy across varying illumination and viewing conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Crater-Based Navigation methods are designed for short-duration landing missions with nadir viewpoints, but lunar mapping missions require sparse, oblique imagery under varying illumination over year-long campaigns, posing greater pose estimation challenges.

Method: STELLA combines Mask R-CNN-based crater detection, descriptor-less crater identification, robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination back-end. Tested on CRESENT-365 dataset with 15,283 images simulating year-long lunar mapping.

Result: STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive assessment of Crater-Based Navigation in true lunar mapping settings, informing operational conditions for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

### [87] [Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751)
*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep vision-only and language-only models trained on separate modalities develop partially aligned representational spaces, with alignment peaking in mid-to-late layers and capturing semantic rather than appearance-based similarities, mirroring human preferences in image-text matching tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and how alignment emerges between unimodal vision and language models, what cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many scenarios, and how exemplar aggregation affects alignment.

Method: Systematic investigation of representational alignment across network layers, testing robustness to semantic vs appearance changes, forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task with human preferences, and analysis of embedding averaging effects.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers, is robust to appearance changes but collapses with semantic alterations, mirrors human preferences bidirectionally, and is amplified by embedding averaging rather than blurred.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation, demonstrating emergent cross-modal alignment without explicit multimodal training.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

*Yuhong Zhang,Han Wang,Yiwen Wang,Rong Xie,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInsert is a training-free framework for personalized object insertion in images using 3D geometric information to achieve precise geometric control and style consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods lack geometric control over inserted objects (confined to 2D space), struggle with style consistency between objects and background, and require extensive training for object insertion.

Method: Convert 2D objects to 3D using existing 3D generation models, perform interactive editing at 3D level, then re-render to 2D from specified views. Combine geometric control with style and content control through diffusion adapters.

Result: The framework produces geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images without requiring training.

Conclusion: FreeInsert successfully addresses geometric control and style consistency challenges in personalized image composition through a 3D-based approach that leverages existing diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

TL;DR: CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement framework that improves identity customization models by combining face swapping, pretrained diffusion models, and a triple-flow fusion approach to achieve better scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis face degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity, which limits their practical applications.

Method: Proposes CustomEnhancer with triple-flow fused PerGeneration that combines counter-directional latent spaces, uses face swapping techniques, and introduces ResInversion for efficient noise rectification via pre-diffusion, reducing inversion time by 129x compared to NTI.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls while demonstrating significant efficiency improvements in inversion time.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer provides an effective solution for enhancing identity customization models with improved control, fidelity, and efficiency, making personalized human photo synthesis more practical and accessible.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

### [91] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework for cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, addressing domain shifts between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the practical challenge where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data in addition to shifts between training and testing sets, which conventional SSDG methods struggle with due to inaccurate pseudolabels.

Method: A dual-supervised asymmetric co-training framework with two sub-models that integrates feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary self-supervised tasks to address inaccurate pseudo supervision and enhance domain-invariant feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation datasets (Fundus, Polyp, SCGM) demonstrate robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Conclusion: The DAC framework effectively addresses the challenging CD-SSDG scenario by mitigating inaccurate pseudolabels through feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks, showing strong performance across multiple medical imaging domains.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

TL;DR: DEIMv2 extends DEIM with DINOv3 features, spanning eight model sizes from X to Atto. It uses DINOv3-pretrained backbones with Spatial Tuning Adapter for larger models and HGNetv2 with pruning for ultra-lightweight models, achieving superior performance-cost trade-offs across diverse deployment scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the successful DEIM framework with DINOv3 features and create a unified design that spans from GPU to mobile deployment, achieving better performance-cost trade-offs than existing real-time DETRs and YOLO series.

Method: For X/L/M/S variants: DINOv3-pretrained/distilled backbones + Spatial Tuning Adapter to convert single-scale to multi-scale features. For Nano/Pico/Femto/Atto: HGNetv2 with depth/width pruning + simplified decoder + upgraded Dense O2O.

Result: DEIMv2-X achieves 57.8 AP with 50.3M parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models. DEIMv2-S (9.71M parameters) reaches 50.9 AP, first sub-10M model to exceed 50 AP. DEIMv2-Pico (1.5M parameters) delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano with 50% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes new state-of-the-art results across all model sizes with superior performance-cost trade-offs, demonstrating effectiveness for diverse deployment scenarios from GPU to mobile devices.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions.

Conclusion: The DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into standard PEFT pipelines to significantly enhance robustness of Vision-Language Models against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods based on prompt learning have limited diversity and ignore information from unknown domains, posing challenges for downstream-task adaptation in federated learning settings.

Method: Introduces domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrates content and domain knowledge into a generative model among clients. During inference, the generator produces DSPs for unseen target domains to guide downstream tasks.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that FedDSPG outperforms existing strong baselines in federated domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: FedDSPG provides an effective generative approach for federated domain generalization by generating domain-specific soft prompts, successfully addressing the limitations of existing methods and achieving superior performance on unknown domains.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: PoisonVID is the first black-box poisoning attack that compromises prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs by using a closed-loop optimization strategy to suppress harmful frame relevance scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier frame sampling strategies for VideoLLMs, the safety of the most recent prompt-guided sampling approach remains unexplored.

Method: PoisonVID uses a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions using a shadow VideoLLM and GPT-4o-mini.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on three prompt-guided sampling strategies across three advanced VideoLLMs shows PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate.

Conclusion: The high attack success rate highlights the importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs that are more robust to such poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

*Abdur Rehman,S M A Sharif,Md Abdur Rahaman,Mohamed Jismy Aashik Rasool,Seongwan Kim,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR is a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances task-specific and knowledge distillation losses in quantization-aware training, improving performance of small quantized models across various AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization, leading to suboptimal performance of compressed models.

Method: Proposes Game of Regularizer (GoR) with only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting, and QAT-EKD-GoR ensemble distillation framework using multiple heterogeneous teacher models.

Result: GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods on image classification, object detection, and LLM compression, delivering faster inference on low-power edge devices while maintaining full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: GoR provides a robust solution for real-world deployment of compressed AI models, with EKD-GoR capable of outperforming full-precision models under optimal conditions.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge evaluated whether large web-collected datasets with labeling errors can compete with smaller expert-verified datasets for automated plant identification across 10,000 species using 1.1M images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if large but noisy training datasets from web sources can effectively compete with smaller, expert-curated datasets for automated plant identification at continental scale, addressing the gap in visual documentation for many plant species.

Method: Used two training strategies: (1) large web-collected dataset with labeling errors, and (2) smaller expert-verified dataset. Tested on a third independent dataset from the Pl@ntNet mobile application to ensure fair comparison.

Result: The challenge evaluated performance of both training approaches on a continental-scale plant identification task covering 10,000 species primarily from Europe and North America.

Conclusion: The study provides comparative analysis of training strategies for large-scale plant identification systems, highlighting the potential and limitations of web-sourced data versus expert-curated data.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [99] [TasselNetV4: A vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20857)
*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TasselNetV4 is a new plant counting model that shifts from species-specific to cross-species counting by combining TasselNet's local counting approach with class-agnostic counting methods, achieving superior performance and efficiency across diverse plant species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant counting models are species-specific, but plants have biodiversity and new cultivars are constantly bred, making it impossible to build models for all species. Plants are dynamic and non-rigid, making current class-agnostic counting models suboptimal for plant counting.

Method: TasselNetV4 builds on a plain vision transformer and incorporates multi-branch box-aware local counters to enhance cross-scale robustness. It marries TasselNet's local counting idea with the extract-and-match paradigm from class-agnostic counting.

Result: Extensive experiments on PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia datasets show TasselNetV4 achieves superior counting performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 emerges as a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting, providing a more scalable solution than species-specific approaches.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

*Botond Fazekas,Guilherme Aresta,Philipp Seeböck,Julia Mai,Ursula Schmidt-Erfurth,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised model for retinal OCT segmentation that introduces a differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of layers and lesions, improving performance while ensuring topological correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods for retinal OCT segmentation often produce anatomically implausible results, fail to model layer-lesion interactions effectively, and lack guarantees on topological correctness.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised model with a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine that enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions. Uses disentangled representation separating spatial and style factors, and leverages unlabeled and partially labeled datasets.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art in both lesion and layer segmentation on public and internal OCT datasets, demonstrates ability to generalize layer segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated data.

Conclusion: Shows the potential of using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2016 plant identification challenge evaluated large-scale plant recognition systems on 110K+ images of 1000 species, with the main novelty being open-set recognition where systems had to handle unknown plant categories not seen during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a realistic biodiversity monitoring scenario by evaluating plant identification methods at very large scale, close to real-world conditions, with the specific challenge of open-set recognition where systems must be robust to unknown plant species.

Method: Used a dataset of over 110,000 images of 1000 plant species from West Europe collected through participatory sensing since 2011. The evaluation focused on open-set recognition, requiring systems to not only classify known species but also automatically reject false positives from unknown categories.

Result: The challenge successfully evaluated various plant identification approaches on a large-scale dataset, with participating research groups developing methods to handle the open-set recognition problem of rejecting unknown species while accurately classifying known ones.

Conclusion: The LifeCLEF 2016 challenge advanced plant identification research by introducing open-set recognition as a key evaluation criterion, moving closer to real-world biodiversity monitoring scenarios where systems must handle previously unseen plant species.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA improves KB-VQA by using summarized and reordered captions to reduce noise and enhance LLM reasoning, achieving 38.8% on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KB-VQA methods using LLMs with image captions suffer from excessive noise in captions and LLMs' poor understanding of VQA tasks, limiting reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses pre-trained visual language model for caption generation, then summarizes and reorders captions to exclude unrelated information, providing contextual examples to enhance LLM understanding.

Result: Achieves 38.8% accuracy on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA using a 6.7B parameter LLM, demonstrating strong performance on challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets.

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA effectively enhances LLM reasoning in VQA tasks through caption summarization and reranking, providing improved task adaptability without costly end-to-end training.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals an asymmetry between perceptual optimization and image quality assessment - fidelity metrics good for IQA aren't necessarily effective for optimization, especially under adversarial training. Discriminator design significantly impacts optimization quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the correlation between perceptual optimization objectives (fidelity and adversarial) and their effectiveness as image quality assessment metrics, which remains underexplored despite their central role.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis of fidelity and adversarial objectives in perceptual optimization, examining their transferability to IQA metrics and the impact of discriminator architecture design.

Result: Found unanticipated asymmetry: fidelity metrics excelling in IQA are ineffective for perceptual optimization, especially under adversarial training. Discriminator design is crucial - patch-level and convolutional architectures provide better detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.

Conclusion: The insights advance understanding of loss function design and its connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled approaches to perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

TL;DR: IOG-VQA model combines Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing to address biases in VQA tasks, improving performance on biased datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models struggle with biases from training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and poor generalization to diverse questions and images.

Method: Integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention to capture complex object interactions and GAN-Based Debiasing to generate unbiased data distributions for robust feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets show excellent performance compared to existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions.

Conclusion: Addressing both object interactions and dataset biases is crucial for advancing VQA tasks, and IOG-VQA effectively combines these components to improve model robustness.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Nuclear Diffusion combines low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling for video restoration, showing improved performance in cardiac ultrasound dehazing compared to traditional RPCA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods struggle with real video data due to their sparsity assumption failing to capture rich variability, and video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content.

Method: A hybrid framework integrating low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling, called Nuclear Diffusion.

Result: Demonstrates improved dehazing performance on cardiac ultrasound data with better contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic) compared to traditional RPCA.

Conclusion: Combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors shows potential for high-fidelity video restoration.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

TL;DR: FerretNet is a lightweight neural network that detects synthetic images by analyzing latent distribution deviations and decoding-induced smoothing effects, achieving 97.1% accuracy across 22 generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of synthetic images from advanced models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs creates challenges for detection, requiring methods to identify subtle generation artifacts.

Method: Uses local pixel dependencies based on Markov Random Fields to reconstruct images and expose texture/edge inconsistencies, then applies FerretNet (1.1M parameters) for detection.

Result: Achieves 97.1% average accuracy on open-world benchmark with 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6% when trained only on ProGAN dataset.

Conclusion: FerretNet provides efficient and robust synthetic image detection by leveraging generation artifacts, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse generative models.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

TL;DR: MoTIF extends concept bottleneck models to video classification by handling temporal dependencies, enabling interpretable analysis of concepts across time while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending interpretable concept bottleneck models from static images to video data is challenging due to temporal dependencies essential for capturing actions and events in videos.

Method: MoTIF is a transformer-inspired architecture that adapts concept bottleneck framework for video classification, handling sequences of arbitrary length and capturing temporal concept dependencies.

Result: The concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: MoTIF successfully extends interpretable concept modeling to video classification, providing three complementary perspectives on concept importance and temporal dependencies.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

TL;DR: Particle filters can solve 3D object localization from camera sequences in resource-constrained scenarios like drone wildfire monitoring, where traditional depth estimation or 3D reconstruction methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object localization methods (dense depth estimation, 3D scene reconstruction) are infeasible for distant objects or computationally limited tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Method: Using particle filters for single and multiple target scenarios with camera poses and image segments, validated through 3D simulation and drone-based image segmentation with GNSS camera pose estimates.

Result: Particle filter successfully solved practical localization tasks where other methods failed, demonstrating applicability for drone-based wildfire monitoring with existing image segmentation models.

Conclusion: Particle filters provide a flexible, detection-method-independent solution for 3D object localization in resource-constrained scenarios, enabling practical drone-based monitoring applications.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba is a novel framework that combines local Mamba-style scanning in shifted windows with global receptive fields to improve semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery, addressing Vision Mamba's limitation of overlooking local features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba has global receptive field and low computational complexity but tends to overlook critical local features like textures and edges that are essential for accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.

Method: SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with global receptive field. First two stages perform local scanning for fine-grained details, while subsequent stages leverage global scanning for broader contextual information. Overlapping shifted windows enhance inter-region information exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SwinMamba shows effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery by better capturing both local and global features.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pack-based multiple instance learning framework for computational pathology that addresses challenges of extreme sequence length variations in whole slide images by packing variable-length sequences into fixed-length ones for efficient training, while preserving data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images in computational pathology have extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K) with significant variations, leading to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods struggle with training efficiency and optimization while preserving this heterogeneity under limited supervision.

Method: Proposes a pack-based MIL framework that packs multiple sampled variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for batched training. Includes a residual branch that composes discarded features into a hyperslide with tailored labels for multi-slide supervision, and an attention-driven downsampler to compress features and reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves up to 8% accuracy improvement while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI) benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant potential for addressing data challenges in computational pathology.

Conclusion: Focusing on data challenges in computational pathology holds significant potential in the era of foundation models. The proposed approach effectively addresses sequence length variations, data heterogeneity, and limited supervision while improving both accuracy and training efficiency.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

*Akihisa Watanabe,Jiawei Ren,Li Siyao,Yichen Peng,Erwin Wu,Edgar Simo-Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff is a simulator-constrained diffusion model that generates physically plausible human motion by integrating environment parameters directly into the denoising process, eliminating the need for expensive simulator calls at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use simulator-based motion projection layers which are computationally expensive due to sequential processing that prevents parallelization.

Method: Interpret simulator-based motion projection as guidance in diffusion process and integrate environment parameters (gravity, wind) directly into denoising through conditioning.

Result: Generates physically plausible motions efficiently without repeated simulator calls, provides fine-grained control over physical coefficients, and demonstrates compositional generalization to unseen parameter combinations.

Conclusion: SimDiff offers an efficient alternative to simulator-based approaches while maintaining physical plausibility and enabling control over environmental parameters.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

*Bum Jun Kim,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies four key architectural design patterns that improve vision model robustness to Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs over CLIP ViTs, with theoretical explanations for each mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to Gaussian noise and convert empirical observations into actionable design rules, as current robustness evaluations rarely dissect architectural dependencies.

Method: Extensive evaluation of 1,174 pretrained vision models to identify robust design patterns, followed by theoretical analysis explaining the causal mechanisms behind observed correlations.

Result: Identified four consistent design patterns yielding up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6% accuracy gains. Theoretically proved that: 1) low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise quadratically with kernel size, 2) anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy proportionally to downsampling factor squared, 3) average pooling suppresses noise proportionally to window area while max pooling incurs positive bias, and 4) CLIP ViTs are more vulnerable due to smaller normalization standard deviations amplifying worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91x.

Conclusion: The study disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, provides theoretical explanations for observed trends, and offers practical plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

TL;DR: This scoping review examines scene graph research in surgery, revealing rapid growth but a 'data divide' between real-world 2D video for internal-view tasks and simulated data for external-view 4D modeling, with foundation models now outperforming generalist vision-language models in surgical contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically map the evolving landscape of scene graph research in surgery, charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions to understand how structured relational representations can decode complex surgical environments.

Method: PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review that systematically analyzes scene graph research in surgery, examining applications, methodological developments, and identifying key research gaps.

Result: Revealed rapid growth in surgical scene graph research but uncovered a critical 'data divide' - internal-view research uses real-world 2D video while external-view 4D modeling relies on simulated data. Foundation models now significantly outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts.

Conclusion: Surgical scene graphs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge that enables intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training, though challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation persist and are being actively addressed.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

Motivation: The dynamic propagation of social media has increased financial advisory content through podcasts, but extracting insights from lengthy (30-40 minutes) multimodal segments remains challenging.

Method: FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with speaker diarization. Uses modified DPO-based loss function with fact-checking and ranker-based retrieval to align keyframes with summarized content.

Result: Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability compared to LLMs and VLMs. Introduces Fin-APT dataset with 470 financial advisory videos.

Conclusion: FASTER establishes a new standard for multimodal summarization, making financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, opening new research avenues.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

*Yue Duan,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASD is an adaptor that enables cold-start SSL learners for deep image clustering without pretraining or prerequisites, achieving near-ground-truth performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL-integrated deep clustering methods require pretraining, clustering learning, or trained models as prerequisites, limiting flexible out-of-box application.

Method: Randomly sample pseudo-labeled data, use instance-level classifier to learn them, track class transitions to extract similarities, assign cluster-level labels, and trigger SSL learner.

Result: Superior performance across benchmarks against latest deep clustering methods, with only 1.33% gap on CIFAR-10 compared to SSL using ground-truth, and can boost existing SSL-embedded methods.

Conclusion: ASD enables effective cold-start SSL for image clustering without prerequisites, achieving near-ground-truth performance and enhancing existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

*Geunhyeok Yu,Sunjae Jeong,Yoonyoung Choi,Jaeseung Kim,Hyoseok Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiNGER is a novel distillation framework that suppresses high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformers while preserving informative signals, improving student model performance through nullspace-guided feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality and cause students to overfit to artifacts rather than learn informative signals during knowledge distillation.

Method: Uses Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) with nullspace-guided perturbation to refine teacher features, preserving information while suppressing artifacts. Implemented efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter.

Result: Consistently improves student models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks, and produces clearer, more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively addresses the artifact suppression vs. signal preservation trade-off in knowledge distillation, enabling better transfer of knowledge from Vision Transformer teachers to student models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNCE is a novel method that prevents harmful content generation in text-to-image models by precisely manipulating just one neuron responsible for harmful concepts, achieving surgical erasure while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models pose safety risks by generating harmful content, and existing concept erasure methods struggle to precisely remove target concepts without degrading image quality.

Method: Train a Sparse Autoencoder to map text embeddings into a sparse latent space, identify harmful concept-specific neurons using modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns, and suppress activations of those neurons.

Result: SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure while preserving generation capabilities for non-target concepts, and shows strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SNCE method enables precise and effective concept erasure in text-to-image models with minimal impact on image quality, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant organ segmentation methods are species-specific, require extensive pre-processing, and need down-sampling to meet hardware/network constraints, losing resolution.

Method: KD-SS algorithm for sub-sampling biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species, allowing segmentation of full-resolution point clouds without down-sampling.

Result: Combining KD-SS with state-of-the-art segmentation models achieves satisfying results across different modalities (photogrammetry, laser triangulation, LiDAR) for various plant species.

Conclusion: KD-SS serves as a lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation, applicable regardless of species and sensor modality.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo is a new FG-BG decomposition framework for few-shot OOD detection that addresses over-reliance on local class similarity and fixed background extraction strategies by learning background prompts and using patch self-calibrated tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods for FS-OOD detection suffer from low robustness due to over-reliance on local class similarity and fixed background patch extraction strategies.

Method: Proposes learning background prompts to obtain local background similarity containing both background and image semantic information, then refining it using local class similarity. Also introduces patch self-calibrated tuning to flexibly select background patches based on sample diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Mambo achieves best performance compared to SOTA methods in both OOD detection and near OOD detection settings.

Conclusion: Mambo effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by reducing dependence on local class similarity and introducing flexible background extraction, demonstrating superior performance in FS-OOD detection.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

TL;DR: IPS and WDES are novel stratification methods for image segmentation datasets that address biased evaluations from random splitting. WDES uses a genetic algorithm to minimize Wasserstein distance between splits, proving globally optimal and producing more representative dataset splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random dataset splitting in image segmentation leads to unrepresentative test sets, biased evaluations, and poor model generalization due to multi-label structure and class imbalance.

Method: Two methods: Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) - label-aware sampling for segmentation; Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES) - genetic algorithm minimizing Wasserstein distance to optimize label distribution similarity across splits.

Result: WDES consistently produces more representative splits than random sampling, leading to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation across street scenes, medical imaging, and satellite imagery tasks.

Conclusion: WDES is particularly valuable for handling small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets where conventional splitting strategies are most prone to bias.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net uses semantic hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals in an end-to-end deep neural network for fine-grained classification, achieving competitive performance without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-grained classification models rely on part annotations or automatic cropping methods, which suffer from incomplete representation of local features needed to distinguish similar objects. Humans recognize objects by forming semantic associations, so leveraging semantic hierarchies could improve classification.

Method: Proposed EnGraf-Net, an end-to-end deep neural network that uses semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals, without requiring cropping techniques or manual part annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets demonstrate EnGraf-Net's superiority over many existing fine-grained models and competitive performance with recent state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Semantic hierarchies can effectively serve as supervised signals for fine-grained classification, achieving strong performance without the need for manual annotations or cropping techniques.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks despite their robustness claims, with attack success rates varying from 40.04% to 99.97% across different ViT models, demonstrating cross-architectural transferability from CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security vulnerabilities of Vision Transformers (ViTs) against adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches, despite ViTs' claimed robustness advantages over CNNs.

Method: Used Creases Transformation (CT) technique to design realistic adversarial patches that add subtle geometric distortions similar to natural clothing creases, and tested transferability of CNN adversarial attack techniques on four fine-tuned ViT models for binary person classification.

Result: Significant vulnerability variations observed: google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k (40.04%), facebook/dino-vitb16 (99.97%), google/vit-base-patch16-224 (66.40%), facebook/dinov3-vitb16 (65.17%).

Conclusion: Adversarial patches successfully transfer from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

*Guojun Lei,Rong Zhang,Chi Wang,Tianhang Liu,Hong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniTransfer is a novel architecture for video concept transfer that uses spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition with a progressive paradigm, achieving precise and controllable video editing through foreground, background, and motion flow separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve precise and controllable video concept transfer by decomposing videos into key components and enabling fine-grained control over different elements in videos.

Method: Proposes spatial decomposition (foreground subject, background, motion flow) with dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture, self-supervised pretraining via random masking, and Chain-of-Prompt mechanism for timestep decomposition using LLM-guided progressive generation.

Result: Achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: UniTransfer demonstrates effective video concept transfer through its decomposition approach and progressive generation strategy, with promising results validated on the curated OpenAnimal dataset.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTTS enhances multimodal LLMs' reasoning through iterative perception during inference, mimicking human hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM methods are limited by static perception stages and don't leverage iterative reasoning like humans do, which is critical for achieving human-level perception and understanding.

Method: VTTS uses Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism with reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal supervision to progressively refine focus on high-confidence regions, guided by updated textual predictions.

Result: Videochat-R1.5 model achieved over 5% average improvement across 15+ benchmarks in video conversation, reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception compared to Qwen2.5VL-3B/-7B baselines.

Conclusion: VTTS effectively enhances MLLM reasoning through iterative perception, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse tasks and benchmarks with the introduced VTTS-80K dataset.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

*Suaiba Amina Salahuddin,Teresa Dorszewski,Marit Almenning Martiniussen,Tone Hovda,Antonio Portaluri,Solveig Thrun,Michael Kampffmeyer,Elisabeth Wetzer,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect is a concept-based explainability framework that uses a mammography-specific vision-language model to analyze what deep learning models learn in mammography, revealing differences between general vs. domain-specific training and trade-offs in concept specialization vs. generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding what DL models learn is essential for safe AI deployment in clinical settings, particularly to move beyond pixel-based explanations and capture the textual concepts that better reflect clinical reasoning.

Method: Leverages Mammo-CLIP (a mammography-specific vision-language model) as a "dissector" to label neurons with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantify their alignment to domain knowledge, investigating differences between training datasets and fine-tuning effects.

Result: Models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align better with radiologists' workflows. Fine-tuning enhances capture of task-specific concepts (e.g., benign calcifications) but reduces coverage of others (e.g., density-related features), showing a specialization vs. generalization trade-off.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how CNNs capture mammography-specific knowledge, revealing how domain-specific training and task adaptation shape concept learning, with implications for clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV is a reinforcement learning framework with Dynamic Time Warping-based process reward that improves video reasoning consistency in multimodal LLMs by aligning reasoning traces with temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs exhibit process inconsistency where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when final answers are correct, undermining interpretability and robustness in video reasoning tasks.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward that aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. Also introduces dynamic state prediction as key measure and constructs MOSS-Video benchmark.

Result: Achieves 87.2% on MOSS-Video test, improves performance on general video benchmarks (MVBench, MMVU), and shows gains across different architectures (Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-2). GPT-4o-as-judge evaluations confirm more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning, demonstrating broad applicability across architectures and producing more interpretable reasoning traces without requiring auxiliary reward models.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

*Guojun Lei,Chi Wang,Yikai Wang,Hong Li,Ying Song,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for generating videos guided by camera trajectories that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with consistency and generalizability when generating videos with camera trajectories, especially when both camera and object motions are present, as they often learn motions separately which causes confusion about relative motion.

Method: Proposes integrating camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, using stable diffusion to learn reference motion maps relative to camera trajectories, and combining these with semantic object priors in an image-to-video network.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively generates videos that accurately follow designated camera trajectories while maintaining consistent object motions, solving the challenge of relative motion confusion in existing methods.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARINOX is a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with principled reward selection to improve compositional alignment in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to achieve compositional alignment for complex prompts describing object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Existing inference-time approaches have limitations: optimization can stall and exploration requires too many samples, while reward metrics don't reliably capture all compositionality aspects.

Method: CARINOX combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments, creating a unified framework that overcomes the limitations of using either approach alone.

Result: CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories while preserving image quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed CARINOX framework effectively addresses compositional alignment challenges in text-to-image generation by synergistically combining optimization and exploration with human-correlated reward selection, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Discriminators face the greatest disadvantage when datasets have either very low or very high complexity, while intermediate-complexity datasets favor detection of synthetic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions where discriminators are most disadvantaged in the AI arms race between image generators and discriminators, particularly examining the effects of data dimensionality and complexity.

Method: Analyzed two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity, using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure to study detectability of synthetic images across different complexity levels.

Result: Both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce detectability of synthetic images; generators can perfectly learn simple datasets, while extreme diversity masks imperfections. Intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection.

Conclusion: The detectability of synthetic images depends on dataset complexity, with discriminators being most disadvantaged at the extremes of complexity spectrum and having the best performance on datasets with intermediate complexity.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

TL;DR: WAVECLIP is a unified CLIP model with adaptive resolution inference using wavelet-based tokenization, enabling dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs through early exits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a single model that can efficiently handle multiple image resolutions and enable adaptive computation at inference time, reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: Replaces standard patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, uses key-value caching and causal cross-level attention for computational reuse, and implements confidence-based gating for adaptive early exits.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings, requiring only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP provides an efficient approach for adaptive resolution inference in vision-language models, enabling dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs with a single deployed model.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quantization of CLIP models reveals counterintuitive effects: it improves calibration for underconfident models but degrades it for overconfident ones, while still enhancing OOD detection. Specific QAT methods can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, and robustness, challenging traditional efficiency-performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While CLIP's zero-shot capabilities enable safety tasks like OOD detection, the impact of quantization on CLIP's reliability beyond accuracy remains underexplored, particularly for efficient and reliable deployment.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing comprehensive reliability metrics including calibration and OOD detection, and identifying specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods.

Result: Quantization consistently improves calibration for underconfident pre-trained models but degrades it for overconfident variants. However, OOD detection can still improve for poorly calibrated models. Specific QAT methods yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness.

Conclusion: Quantization can be utilized beyond conventional efficiency roles to navigate the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust vision-language models, challenging strict efficiency-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTU benchmarks use synthetic renderings lacking real-world complexity and visual diversity, and existing datasets offer fixed examples without underlying data for reformulation.

Method: Created TABLET dataset with 4M examples from 2M unique tables (88% preserving original visualizations), including paired image-HTML representations, metadata, and provenance information linking to source datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on both seen and unseen VTU tasks and increases robustness on real-world table visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models by preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified

*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conformal prediction-based method to control explanation fidelity in feature attribution methods for image predictions, ensuring identified salient features preserve model predictions regardless of excluded features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods for image predictions vary in robustness and may not faithfully reflect the underlying model's reasoning, requiring better fidelity control in explanations.

Method: A conformal prediction-based approach that identifies salient feature subsets sufficient to preserve model predictions, using four proposed conformity functions to quantify explanation fidelity without needing ground-truth explanations for calibration.

Result: Empirical evaluation across five explainers and six image datasets shows FastSHAP consistently outperforms competing methods in fidelity and informational efficiency (explanation region size), with super-pixel conformity measures being more effective than pixel-wise ones.

Conclusion: The proposed conformal prediction approach successfully enables direct control over explanation fidelity and identifies efficient salient feature subsets, with super-pixel based conformity measures proving superior to pixel-level approaches.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma is a unified skeleton-based sign language understanding framework that addresses semantic grounding, local-global balance, and cross-modal learning challenges through sign-aware early fusion, hierarchical alignment learning, and multi-task pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skeleton-based SLU methods face three key limitations: weak semantic grounding (struggle to relate motion patterns to linguistic meaning), imbalance between local details and global context, and inefficient cross-modal learning for semantically aligned representations.

Method: Proposes Sigma framework with: 1) sign-aware early fusion for deep visual-textual interaction, 2) hierarchical alignment learning to capture both fine-grained details and high-level semantics, and 3) unified pre-training combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of semantically informative pre-training and validates skeletal data as a robust stand-alone solution for SLU, showing significant improvements in semantic understanding and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive study evaluating how well automated metrics for text-image generation align with human judgment across various compositional challenges, finding that no single metric performs consistently across all tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-image generation evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics that are often adopted by convention rather than being validated against human judgment, making it critical to understand how well these metrics reflect human preferences.

Method: The authors conducted a broad study examining widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation, going beyond simple correlation to analyze their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments.

Result: Results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks, with performance varying by compositional problem type. VQA-based metrics are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics contribute little to compositional evaluation.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection for trustworthy evaluation and their use as reward models in generation, highlighting that metric performance depends on the specific compositional challenge being evaluated.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlideMamba integrates Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks for Whole Slide Image analysis, using entropy-based adaptive fusion to balance local and global information, achieving superior performance in predicting gene fusion and mutation status.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalizable deep learning framework that captures both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies in Whole Slide Images for enhanced computational pathology analysis.

Method: Combines Mamba modules for long-range global dependencies with GNNs for fine-grained short-range spatial interactions, using an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism for adaptive fusion of complementary signals.

Result: Achieved PRAUC of 0.751 ± 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491), Trans-MIL (0.39), Mamba-only (0.664), GNN-only (0.748), and GAT-Mamba (0.703). Also demonstrated competitive ROC AUC (0.738), sensitivity (0.662), and specificity (0.725).

Conclusion: The integrated architecture with entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy shows strong performance and promising potential for spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified framework for fine-grained controllable 3D asset generation that accepts multiple input modalities including images, point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing 3D generative models rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption in production workflows.

Method: Built on Hunyuan3D 2.1, the model uses a single cross-modal architecture that unifies all conditioning signals instead of separate heads for each modality. It employs a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals while downweighting easier ones.

Result: Experiments show that the additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

Conclusion: The unified framework enables fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation with multiple input modalities, addressing the limitations of existing methods and improving practical adoption in production environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often exploit superficial correlations (cheat) rather than making predictions for the right reasons, raising concerns about their reliability. Existing methods require labor-intensive expert annotations, limiting scalability.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts, and introduce an auxiliary loss to align CNN attention with these language-guided maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColoredMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, showing improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and attention maps that better reflect human intuition.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable solution to improve CNN reliability and cognitive plausibility by automatically generating semantic attention guidance through vision-language models, eliminating the need for manual annotations.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI complexity and heterogeneity challenge automated analysis, and existing foundation models are limited for MRI due to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus.

Method: Trained on 200,000 MRI series using self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision, featuring a modular design with frozen pretrained encoder and lightweight task-specific decoders.

Result: Outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific approaches across disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decipher-MR establishes a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI that facilitates efficient development across clinical and research domains.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for

TL;DR: SQ-InstructBLIP improves vision-language reasoning by generating image-aware sub-questions and answers through a three-component architecture (Questioner, Answerer, Reasoner) that share the same model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks, and existing LLM-based approaches have limitations: they can't access fine-grained visual content and use black-box models that are inaccessible and hard to reproduce.

Method: Proposed SQ-InstructBLIP with three components sharing the same architecture: Questioner generates sub-questions, Answerer generates sub-answers, and Reasoner performs final reasoning using the sub-question information to answer the main question.

Result: Experiments show that SQ-InstructBLIP performs more accurate reasoning than previous works on VQA tasks by using generated sub-questions as additional information.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses multi-step reasoning challenges in vision-language understanding by generating image-aware sub-questions and answers through an interpretable, reproducible architecture.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper defines hallucination in text-to-image models as bias-driven deviations from prompts and proposes a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of text-to-image models focus mainly on alignment with prompt elements but overlook what models generate beyond the prompt, failing to address bias-driven deviations.

Method: The authors propose a new framing for hallucination in text-to-image models and develop a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.

Result: This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases in text-to-image models.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy provides a foundation for richer assessment of text-to-image models by addressing bias-driven deviations beyond simple prompt alignment.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

TL;DR: A person-independent micro-action recognition framework that uses distributionally robust optimization to handle inter-person variability, with temporal-frequency alignment and group-invariant regularization for robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-action recognition methods fail in real-world scenarios due to inter-person variability causing the same actions to manifest differently, which hinders robust generalization.

Method: Proposed Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework with two components: Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module (dual-branch design with Wasserstein-regularized temporal alignment and variance-guided frequency perturbations) and Group-Invariant Regularized Loss (pseudo-group partitioning with boundary case up-weighting and subgroup variance regularization).

Result: Experiments on MA-52 dataset show the framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses inter-person variability in micro-action recognition through distributionally robust optimization principles, enabling robust person-agnostic representations and stable generalization.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve semantic matching by adapting 3D geometric foundation model VGGT to address geometric ambiguity and nearest-neighbor limitations in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic matching approaches suffer from geometric ambiguity (failing to disambiguate symmetric structures) and limitations of nearest-neighbor rule (ignoring cross-image invisibility and manifold preservation).

Method: Retains VGGT's strengths by reusing early features, fine-tuning later stages, adding semantic head for bidirectional correspondences, and adapts through cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training with aliasing mitigation.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation, outperforming previous baselines.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts 3D geometric foundation models to semantic matching, addressing key limitations of existing methods and achieving improved performance.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVSR is a medical video super-resolution framework that addresses challenges like camera shake, noise, and frame transitions in low-resolution medical videos through Cross State-Space Propagation for alignment and Inner State-Space Reconstruction for artifact reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution medical videos are crucial for accurate diagnosis but hard to acquire due to hardware limitations. Low-resolution medical videos present unique challenges including camera shake, noise, abrupt frame transitions causing optical flow errors, and current VSR models introduce artifacts that can mislead doctors.

Method: Proposes MedVSR with two key components: 1) Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) projects distant frames as control matrices in state-space models to selectively propagate consistent features for effective alignment, 2) Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) enhances tissue structures and reduces artifacts through joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation.

Result: Experiments across four datasets in diverse medical scenarios (endoscopy and cataract surgeries) show MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in both reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MedVSR provides an effective solution for medical video super-resolution by addressing alignment challenges and artifact issues specific to medical videos, demonstrating superior performance across various medical scenarios.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in multimodal reasoning models by proposing Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) to stabilize RL fine-tuning, releasing large-scale curated datasets, and open-sourcing multimodal reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of large multimodal reasoning models is constrained by the lack of open, high-quality long chain-of-thought data and the instability of RL algorithms in post-training, particularly GRPO's susceptibility to gradient vanishing with low reward variance.

Method: Proposes Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) using Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity; releases ~1.6M long CoT data and ~15k RL QA pairs; open-sources multimodal reasoning models with reproducible training codebase.

Result: Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of both curated data and VAS. Theoretically establishes that reward variance lower-bounds expected policy gradient magnitude.

Conclusion: The work provides practical solutions for stable RL fine-tuning through variance-aware data selection, establishes standardized baselines with open resources, and advances multimodal reasoning capabilities through comprehensive data and algorithmic improvements.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Conclusion: This new generation of geospatial AI models has potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to

TL;DR: SHINE is a training-free framework for seamless image composition that leverages pretrained diffusion models to handle complex lighting and high-resolution inputs without latent inversion or attention surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image composition models struggle with complex lighting conditions (shadows, reflections) and diverse high-resolution inputs. Current diffusion models have the necessary priors but lack proper frameworks to utilize them effectively.

Method: SHINE uses manifold-steered anchor loss with pretrained customization adapters (like IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background. It also employs degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending.

Result: SHINE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ComplexCompo benchmark and DreamEditBench, with superior scores on standard metrics (DINOv2) and human-aligned evaluations (DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SHINE provides an effective training-free solution for high-fidelity image composition that handles complex lighting and high-resolution inputs better than existing methods, demonstrated through rigorous benchmarking.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

### [151] [Quantized Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21302)
*Weilun Feng,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Chuanguang Yang,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVGGT is a novel quantization framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers that addresses heavy-tailed activation distributions and unstable calibration in 3D reconstruction models, achieving 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration while maintaining 98% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale transformers in 3D reconstruction models (VGGTs) have prohibitive computational and memory costs that hinder real-world deployment. PTQ faces unique obstacles with billion-scale VGGTs due to heavy-tailed activation distributions from special tokens and unstable calibration from multi-view 3D data.

Method: QuantVGGT introduces Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization (pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing) to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel variance, and Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling (outlier filtering via deep-layer statistics and frame-aware diverse calibration clusters) to ensure stable quantization ranges.

Result: QuantVGGT achieves state-of-the-art results across different benchmarks and bit-widths, with 4-bit quantization delivering 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration in real-hardware inference while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98% of full-precision counterpart.

Conclusion: QuantVGGT demonstrates vast advantages and practicality for resource-constrained scenarios, effectively compressing billion-scale 3D reconstruction transformers while preserving performance, making them deployable in real-world applications.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen integrates neural networks with Newtonian physics to generate physically consistent videos with controllable dynamics, addressing current limitations in text-to-video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack parameter control due to learning motion distributions only from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.

Method: Proposes NewtonGen framework with trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) that models Newtonian motions and injects latent dynamical constraints into video generation.

Result: Enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control by jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance.

Conclusion: Integrating learnable physical principles with data-driven synthesis addresses fundamental limitations in video generation, enabling more realistic and controllable motion synthesis.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Conclusion: CATCH-FM demonstrates robust cancer risk prediction across different patient distributions and healthcare systems, showing the effectiveness of EHR foundation models for accessible cancer pre-screening. Code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients

compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative

demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site

### [155] [Can Federated Learning Safeguard Private Data in LLM Training? Vulnerabilities, Attacks, and Defense Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20680)
*Wenkai Guo,Xuefeng Liu,Haolin Wang,Jianwei Niu,Shaojie Tang,Jing Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning for LLM fine-tuning still risks data leakage despite privacy claims; enhanced attacks can extract training data, with larger models being more vulnerable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether federated learning truly protects privacy in LLM fine-tuning, as organizations need collaborative training but are unwilling to share local data.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments using straightforward generation methods and introduced enhanced attack strategies that track global model updates during FL training.

Result: Attackers can extract training data from global models even with simple methods, with leakage increasing with model size; enhanced FL-specific attacks further intensify privacy risks.

Conclusion: Privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates, and safety-aligned LLMs are needed to mitigate data leakage risks in federated LLM training.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

*Zhenpeng Su,Leiyu Pan,Minxuan Lv,Yuntao Li,Wenping Hu,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-GPPO is a novel RL algorithm that preserves gradients from clipped tokens in PPO to better control entropy dynamics and improve exploration-exploitation balance in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like PPO discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to clipping, which overlooks their critical role in regulating entropy evolution during LLM training.

Method: Proposed CE-GPPO algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in PPO in a gentle, bounded manner by controlling gradient magnitude from tokens outside the clipping interval.

Result: CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability and consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Preserving gradients from clipped tokens is crucial for better entropy control in RL-based LLM optimization, and CE-GPPO provides an effective solution for achieving improved exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StyleBench is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating five reasoning styles (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) across 15 models and 5 reasoning tasks, revealing that no single style is universally optimal and strategy effectiveness depends on model scale and task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand the interplay between reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type, as current understanding of how different reasoning strategies affect LLM performance across various models and tasks is limited.

Method: Created StyleBench benchmark to evaluate five representative reasoning styles on five reasoning tasks using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters.

Result: No single reasoning style is universally optimal. Search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Smaller models often fail to follow instructions and default to guessing, with reasoning robustness scaling with model size.

Conclusion: Strategy efficacy is highly contingent on model scale and task type, providing a roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints. The benchmark is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in

### [158] [CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)
*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLUE framework uses circuit discovery and CNF transformation to precisely identify and target specific neurons for unlearning, achieving better forget efficacy and retain utility than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization-based LLM unlearning methods treat neurons as an entangled group, leading to uniform interventions that cause catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of target knowledge.

Method: Proposed CLUE framework: identifies forget and retain circuits using circuit discovery, transforms circuits into conjunctive normal forms (CNF), analyzes neuron assignments in CNF solutions, and applies targeted fine-tuning strategies for different neuron categories.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CLUE framework effectively disentangles neurons for forgetting and retaining, enabling more precise and effective LLM unlearning without compromising unrelated capabilities.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Brian M. Kurkoski,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Binary Autoencoder (BAE) with minibatch entropy minimization to improve feature sparsity and independence in LLM interpretability, outperforming existing methods in producing interpretable features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoder methods for LLM feature extraction rely on implicit regularization that causes dense (non-sparse) features, harming feature sparsity and atomization across instances.

Method: Binary Autoencoder (BAE) that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, discretizing activations to 1-bit via step function with gradient estimation for backpropagation.

Result: BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable features among baselines, and enables reliable entropy estimation for characterizing LLM inference dynamics and in-context learning.

Conclusion: BAE effectively serves as a feature extractor by promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances through minibatch entropy minimization.

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICL works by selectively removing redundant information from non-selective representations in language models' hidden states, with specific attention heads (Denoising Heads) enabling this information removal process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inner mechanism of In-context Learning (ICL) in language models, particularly why it works as a few-shot learning paradigm.

Method: Investigated ICL through information removal perspective, using low-rank filters to remove specific information from hidden states, measuring hidden states with designed metrics, and identifying Denoising Heads that enable the removal operation.

Result: Found that zero-shot LMs encode non-selective representations leading to arbitrary outputs, while few-shot ICL effectively removes redundant information to focus on intended tasks. Blocking Denoising Heads significantly degrades ICL accuracy, especially when correct labels are absent from demonstrations.

Conclusion: The key mechanism underlying ICL is selective information removal from entangled representations, with Denoising Heads playing a critical role in this process.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTA-Code is a synthetic coding benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can learn new reasoning strategies through RL and transfer them to out-of-distribution problems, revealing grokking phase transitions and limitations in transformative generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can genuinely acquire new reasoning strategies beyond their pre-training, addressing the open question about their ability to learn and generalize novel algorithmic skills.

Method: Created DELTA-Code benchmark with templated problem generators, used RL training with techniques like staged warm-up, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop to enable learning on previously unsolvable problems.

Result: Models showed grokking phase transitions - sudden jumps to near-perfect accuracy after extended near-zero reward periods. Achieved solid gains within families and recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative generalization.

Conclusion: DELTA provides a clean testbed for probing RL-driven reasoning limits, showing models can acquire new algorithmic skills but struggle with transformative generalization beyond existing priors.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

TL;DR: ScaleDiff is a pipeline that efficiently identifies difficult math problems from existing datasets and trains a specialized generator to create large-scale difficult problems, enabling improved reasoning model performance without expensive API costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automated mathematical problem synthesis face challenges with high computational/API costs, complex prompting, and limited difficulty levels of generated problems.

Method: Use adaptive thinking model to identify difficult problems with single forward pass, then train DiffGen-8B on filtered difficult data to generate new difficult problems at scale without complex prompting.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields 11.3% performance increase and 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent LRMs like OpenThinker3.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff effectively transfers advanced reasoning capabilities using cost-efficient models, demonstrates clear scaling phenomenon with difficult problems, and eliminates need for expensive teacher models or complex prompting.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

TL;DR: DARTVAE is a rule-guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain-specific constraints into representation learning using variational autoencoders, achieving more meaningful clusters than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods rely only on input data similarity and cannot capture structural or semantic constraints critical in many domains, limiting their operational meaningfulness.

Method: Extends VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data-driven features into a unified latent space. Uses LLM-generated rules structured into knowledge graphs and enforces constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function.

Result: Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets show rule-guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful clusters (e.g., isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, separating SUVs from sedans) while improving traditional clustering metrics.

Conclusion: DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering than purely data-driven models by combining rule encodings with learned representations, though challenges remain with LLM rule generation, overfitting risks, and computational scaling.

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

### [164] [Bispectral OT: Dataset Comparison using Symmetry-Aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20678)
*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bispectral Optimal Transport is a symmetry-aware extension of discrete optimal transport that uses bispectrum representations to preserve signal structure while removing group action variations, achieving better class preservation than naive feature OT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimal transport ignores intrinsic coherence structure in symmetry-rich settings, leading to poor alignment that doesn't capture semantic relationships.

Method: Extends discrete optimal transport by comparing elements using bispectrum representations - a group Fourier invariant that preserves signal structure while removing group action variations.

Result: Bispectral OT achieves greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets with visual symmetries, producing meaningful correspondences that capture semantic label structure.

Conclusion: Bispectral OT improves optimal transport by making it symmetry-aware, enabling better preservation of semantic structure while removing nuisance variations.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

### [165] [FERD: Fairness-Enhanced Data-Free Robustness Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20793)
*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FERD is a data-free robustness distillation framework that addresses robust fairness issues by adjusting adversarial example proportion and distribution to improve worst-class robustness across categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free robustness distillation methods focus on overall robustness but overlook robust fairness, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories where student models behave significantly differently across categories and robustness is unstable across different attack targets.

Method: FERD uses a robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for less robust categories, generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) with uniformity constraints on feature-level predictions, and constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) with uniform target class constraints to avoid biased attack directions.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets show FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attacks, improving worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack by 15.1% and 6.4% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FERD demonstrates superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects by addressing robust fairness issues in data-free robustness distillation through balanced adversarial example generation and distribution.

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

### [166] [CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Numeric Time Series?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20823)
*Luca Zhou,Pratham Yashwante,Marshall Fisher,Alessio Sampieri,Zihao Zhou,Fabio Galasso,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench is a new large-scale benchmark for context-aware time series captioning that addresses limitations of existing datasets by incorporating real-world data, metadata, visual representations, and human-verified captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series captioning benchmarks rely on synthetic data, simplistic captions, and neglect metadata and visual representations, creating a gap in realistic evaluation.

Method: Created CaTS-Bench from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A tasks, with a scalable pipeline using LLM-generated captions verified through factual checks, human studies, and diversity analyses, plus a human-revisited subset.

Result: Produced a benchmark with ~465k training and 105k test timestamps, including numeric series, metadata, line-chart images, captions, and 460 multiple-choice questions for deeper reasoning.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench provides a reliable, extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models, with new evaluation metrics highlighting VLM strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

### [167] [FHRFormer: A Self-supervised Transformer Approach for Fetal Heart Rate Inpainting and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20852)
*Kjersti Engan,Neel Kanwal,Anita Yeconia,Ladislaus Blacy,Yuda Munyaw,Estomih Mduma,Hege Ersdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A masked transformer-based autoencoder method for reconstructing missing fetal heart rate (FHR) signals from wearable monitors, addressing signal dropouts caused by maternal movement and enabling better AI-based risk prediction for neonatal breathing assistance needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Approximately 10% of newborns need breathing assistance at birth, and FHR monitoring is crucial for detecting fetal risks. However, wearable FHR monitors suffer from signal dropouts due to maternal movement, limiting AI-based analysis and risk prediction capabilities.

Method: Proposed a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach that captures both spatial and frequency components of FHR data to reconstruct missing signals, handling varying durations of missing data for signal inpainting and forecasting.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness across different missing data durations and can be used for both signal reconstruction and forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: The approach can be applied to research datasets for developing AI-based risk algorithms and potentially integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices for earlier and more robust risk detection of neonatal breathing assistance needs.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

*Killian Steunou,Sigurd Saue,Théo Druilhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using sparse PCA (SPCA) as a defense against adversarial attacks, showing it provides better robustness than standard PCA while maintaining good clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and the authors want to explore simple, data-adapted defenses using linear dimensionality reduction methods.

Method: The authors empirically compare PCA and SPCA as front-end feature extractors, and provide theoretical analysis including robustness certificates for linear heads and Lipschitz bounds for non-linear heads.

Result: SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Sparse projections reduce adversarial leverage, and this benefit persists beyond the linear setting, making SPCA an effective defense mechanism.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

### [169] [A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21167)
*Nicola Novello,Federico Fontana,Luigi Cinque,Deniz Gunduz,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified f-divergence framework for machine unlearning in diffusion models, showing that existing MSE-based approaches are a special case and that different f-divergences offer trade-offs between unlearning effectiveness and concept preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods for text-to-image models rely on minimizing MSE between output distributions, but this approach has limitations and may not be optimal for all applications.

Method: The authors propose a unified f-divergence-based framework where any f-divergence can be used for unlearning, analyzing how different divergences affect convergence and unlearning quality.

Result: The framework shows that MSE-based approaches are a special case of the broader f-divergence family, and different divergences offer varying trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Conclusion: The unified f-divergence framework provides a flexible paradigm for machine unlearning in diffusion models, allowing selection of optimal divergences for specific applications based on desired trade-offs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

*Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Fan Xu,Fan Zhang,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Xiaomeng Huang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DINO is a novel neural operator framework that decomposes turbulent dynamics into local differential and global integral operators, achieving superior long-term forecasting stability and physical fidelity compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods fail in long-term turbulence forecasting due to catastrophic error accumulation and inability to capture both local dissipative effects and global non-local interactions simultaneously.

Method: Proposes DINO framework with parallel branches: a constrained convolutional network for local differential operator (provably converges to derivative) and a Transformer architecture for global integral operator (learns data-driven global kernel).

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, suppresses error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in vorticity fields and energy spectra.

Conclusion: DINO establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecasting through physics-based operator decomposition.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

TL;DR: Perspectra is an interactive multi-agent system that visualizes deliberation among LLM agents through a forum-style interface, enhancing critical thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration in research proposal development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems lack effective user control, steering, and critical evaluation capabilities for collaboration among domain-expert agents, creating a need for better tools to manage adversarial discourse.

Method: Developed Perspectra with forum-style interface, @-mention for targeted agent invitations, threading for parallel exploration, and real-time mind map visualization of arguments and rationales. Conducted within-subjects study with 18 participants comparing Perspectra to group-chat baseline.

Result: Perspectra significantly increased critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions compared to group chat condition.

Conclusion: Multi-agent tools should support user control over adversarial discourse to scaffold critical thinking, as demonstrated by Perspectra's effectiveness in enhancing deliberation and collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent
adversarial discourse.

TL;DR: InsightGUIDE is an AI-powered reading assistant that provides structured, concise insights as a 'map' to paper key elements, rather than replacing reading with verbose summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM tools provide verbose summaries that risk replacing rather than assisting reading, creating challenges for researchers navigating proliferating scientific literature.

Method: Embed an expert's reading methodology into core AI logic using prompt-driven methodology and specific system architecture to generate structured insights.

Result: Qualitative case study shows InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance compared to general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: InsightGUIDE serves as a more effective tool for modern researchers by functioning as a reading assistant rather than replacement.

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a

comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is a neuro-symbolic framework that treats knowledge graph context construction as a sequential decision process, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and cost through multi-agent coordination with budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime, failing to balance accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance.

Method: CLAUSE uses a three-agent neuro-symbolic framework with Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) to coordinate Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator agents for joint optimization of subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection under resource budgets.

Result: Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE achieves higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, it achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth compared to GraphRAG.

Conclusion: CLAUSE produces compact, provenance-preserving contexts that deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints, effectively balancing accuracy, latency, and cost trade-offs without retraining.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the hypothesis that persuasion efficacy depends on model scale, proposing instead that cognitive processes and reasoning capacity are key. It identifies a Persuasion Duality where LRMs resist persuasion but become highly persuasive when their reasoning is transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems where LLMs and LRMs collaborate, challenging the prevailing scale-based hypothesis and examining how cognitive processes affect persuasive behavior.

Method: Conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments to analyze persuasion resistance and efficacy, examined the impact of sharing reasoning content, and studied complex transmission persuasion in multi-agent networks.

Result: Found that LRMs with explicit reasoning are more resistant to persuasion but become highly persuasive when their reasoning process is transparent. Complex dynamics of influence propagation and decay were observed in multi-hop persuasion networks.

Conclusion: A model's internal processing architecture directly influences its external persuasive behavior, with important implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future Multi-Agent Systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

TL;DR: TrustJudge addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks through a probabilistic approach that reduces score-comparison and pairwise transitivity inconsistencies while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks suffer from critical inconsistencies including score-comparison issues (lower-rated responses outperforming higher-scored ones) and pairwise transitivity violations (circular preferences and equivalence contradictions).

Method: TrustJudge uses distribution-sensitive scoring to compute continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, and likelihood-aware aggregation to resolve transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity.

Result: TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%) while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: TrustJudge provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms and offers practical solutions for reliable automated assessment without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to selectively use high-value chain-of-thought (CoT) data by identifying atomic reasoning patterns and using a dual-granularity algorithm to efficiently select data that enhances model reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use CoT data indiscriminately without understanding which data types most effectively improve reasoning capabilities. The paper aims to identify high-value reasoning patterns to optimize model training.

Method: Define reasoning potential as inverse of attempts needed to answer correctly. Abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, create a core reference set, and use a dual-granularity algorithm (chains of reasoning patterns + token entropy) to select high-value CoT data (CoTP).

Result: Using only 10B-token CoTP data, the 85A6B MoE model improved by 9.58% on AIME 2024/2025 and raised the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective use of high-value CoT data with valuable reasoning patterns significantly enhances model reasoning capabilities and downstream performance with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of concept-based in-context learning (CB-ICL) to understand why and when it performs well with few demonstrations, quantifying knowledge transfer and providing insights for model pre-training and prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical understanding of in-context learning mechanisms in large language models remains limited, despite its importance in NLP applications.

Method: The authors propose theoretical analyses on applying concept-based ICL (CB-ICL) to ICL tasks, developing a similarity measure between prompt demonstrations and query inputs, and exploring the impact of demonstration size and embedding dimensions.

Result: The theory explains why CB-ICL performs well with few demonstrations, quantifies knowledge leverage from LLMs to prompt tasks, and provides guidance for pre-training and prompt engineering.

Conclusion: Real-data experiments validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the proposed theoretical framework, offering important insights for improving ICL performance.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

*Yandan Yang,Baoxiong Jia,Shujie Zhang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SceneWeaver is a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement for indoor scene generation, outperforming prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current indoor scene synthesis approaches are constrained to fixed scene categories, lack object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle with complex user instructions, while Embodied AI requires visually realistic, physically plausible, and functionally diverse 3D environments.

Method: SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from extensible scene generation tools (data-driven generative models, visual- and LLM-based methods) in a closed-loop reason-act-reflect design, enabling iterative refinement through self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show SceneWeaver outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, and generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions across common and open-vocabulary room types.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver marks a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation by unifying diverse scene synthesis paradigms through agentic iterative refinement, addressing limitations of current approaches in physical consistency and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

*Yuguang Chen,Xinhai Liu,Yang Li,Victor Cheung,Zhuo Chen,Dongyu Zhang,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ArtUV is an automated end-to-end method for generating artist-style UV unwrapping that addresses limitations of existing methods through semantic seam prediction and refinement of rough UV maps into high-quality artist-style outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming processes, fragmentation, lack of semantic meaning, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use in professional graphics workflows.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) SeamGPT for semantically meaningful cutting seam prediction, 2) Auto-Encoder that refines rough UV maps from optimization-based methods into artist-style UV maps while preserving topological structure.

Result: ArtUV generates high-quality UV maps with semantic consistency, clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and is ready for 2D editing. It works as both a plug-in for professional tools and standalone system.

Conclusion: ArtUV provides a versatile automated solution for professional-quality UV unwrapping that meets both fundamental criteria (overlap-free, minimal distortion) and higher-level standards (clean boundaries, semantic coherence).

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SeamCrafter is an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator that uses dual-branch point-cloud encoding and Direct Preference Optimization to create high-quality mesh seams with lower distortion and fragmentation than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poorly placed mesh seams cause severe UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, which hinders texture synthesis and disrupts artist workflows. Existing methods often trade off between high distortion and many scattered islands.

Method: Uses an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator conditioned on point cloud inputs with a dual-branch encoder that captures topological and geometric cues. Fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization on a preference dataset from a novel seam-evaluation framework.

Result: Produces seams with substantially lower distortion and fragmentation than prior approaches while preserving topological consistency and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: SeamCrafter effectively addresses the trade-off between distortion and fragmentation in mesh seam generation, providing superior seam quality for UV parametrization and texture mapping.

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

*Jiabao Lei,Kewei Shi,Zhihao Liang,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Progressive auto-regressive mesh generation using transformer models that builds meshes from coarse to fine detail through local remeshing, reversing mesh simplification processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-regressive mesh generation models build meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which doesn't effectively capture underlying geometry in a human-perception-aligned manner.

Method: Generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and use transformer-based auto-regressive model to approximate the reverse process of mesh simplification, starting from a single point and gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing with alterable topology.

Result: The progressive mesh generation approach provides intuitive control over generation quality and time consumption through early stopping, and enables applications like mesh refinement and editing.

Conclusion: Progressive coarse-to-fine auto-regressive mesh generation is more effective than traditional face-by-face approaches, offering better geometric understanding and practical control over the generation process.

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

TL;DR: ArchGPT is a multimodal architectural visual question answering model trained on Arch-300K, a specialized dataset of 315,000 architecture image-question-answer triplets, addressing limitations of case-specific VR/MR/AR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VR/MR/AR systems for architectural exploration are developed case-by-case with hard-coded annotations that don't scale across diverse built environments, limiting accessibility and understanding of architectural heritage.

Method: Created Arch-300K dataset using multi-stage pipeline: curated architectural scenes from Wikimedia Commons, filtered images via coarse-to-fine strategy with 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation, used LLM-guided text verification for QA pairs, and synthesized formal analysis annotations. Fine-tuned ShareGPT4V-7B on this dataset.

Result: Developed ArchGPT, a domain-specialized multimodal architectural VQA model capable of answering questions about architectural images, providing richer semantic understanding of built environments.

Conclusion: ArchGPT and the scalable data-construction pipeline enable more accessible and scalable architectural exploration and interpretation, advancing beyond case-specific VR/MR/AR systems for education, heritage preservation, and design practice.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel analytical method for extracting surfaces from neural implicit functions that avoids spatial discretization, achieving high accuracy and competitive speed through depth-first traversal of neuron partitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing, and conventional methods like Marching Cubes rely on spatial decomposition and sampling, leading to inaccuracies due to fixed resolution limitations.

Method: Analytical surface extraction from neural implicit functions using depth-first traversal strategy that leverages how each neuron partitions the domain, operating natively in parallel and handling large neural architectures.

Result: The method produces meshes that faithfully capture full geometric information from neural networks without spatial discretization, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while maintaining competitive speed.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient and accurate conversion between implicit and explicit surface representations, overcoming limitations of conventional methods by avoiding spatial discretization and leveraging neural network structure.

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

TL;DR: CHARM is a parametric representation and generative framework for anime hairstyle modeling that uses a compact control-point-based parameterization and autoregressive transformer to generate high-fidelity anime hairstyles from images or point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hair modeling methods focus on realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, but anime hairstyles exhibit highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that challenges existing techniques. Existing methods are inefficient for editing and unsuitable for scalable learning.

Method: CHARM introduces a compact, invertible control-point-based parameterization where each hair card is represented by a sequence of control points with only five geometric parameters. It uses an autoregressive generative framework that interprets anime hairstyles as a sequential 'hair language', capturing both local geometry and global hairstyle topology.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generation quality. The method is supported by AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles.

Conclusion: CHARM offers an expressive and scalable solution for anime hairstyle modeling that supports both artist-friendly design and learning-based generation, providing high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation capabilities.

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and

TL;DR: Analysis of how credibility is packaged in nutrition/supplement videos on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube through authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how credibility is constructed in health advice videos on short-form platforms where alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content, rather than adjudicating truth claims.

Method: Cross-platform corpus of 152 videos analyzed using 26 annotation features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative strategies, and engagement cues, with a multimodal annotation pipeline including automatic speech recognition and human verification.

Result: Dominant pattern is confident single presenters in studio/home settings; authority cues frequently co-occur with persuasive elements (jargon, fear/urgency, critiques of mainstream medicine, conspiracies) and monetization; science-like visuals often accompany emotive/oppositional narratives.

Conclusion: Credibility in health videos is packaged through complex intersections where authority signals are combined with persuasive techniques and commercial incentives, often using science-like elements to support emotional or oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Conclusion: The study establishes the importance of location-aware context for automotive GUI agents and releases Automotive-ENV benchmark to advance development of safe and adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,

multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based

Conclusion: Equi-RO provides a highly effective solution for 4D radar odometry that demonstrates superior performance in challenging environmental conditions where traditional sensors like LiDARs and cameras fail.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in

TL;DR: FINS is a lightweight framework for fast neural surface reconstruction from single or few images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit surface reconstruction methods like NeuS require multiple images and long training times, limiting their practical applications in robotics.

Method: Integrates multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry/color heads, uses approximate second-order optimizer, and leverages pre-trained foundation models for single-image geometry estimation.

Result: Achieves faster convergence (within seconds) and higher accuracy than baselines on surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation, demonstrated on various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FINS enables efficient neural surface reconstruction from minimal input, making it suitable for robotics applications like surface following tasks.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

*Shouren Mao,Minghao Qin,Wei Dong,Huajian Liu,Yongzhuo Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS is a resource-aware multi-objective neural architecture search method that improves supernet pretraining and considers actual robot hardware resources, achieving high accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency on robotic edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NAS approaches are insufficient for training supernets and pay little attention to actual robot hardware resources, creating a gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-awareness.

Method: Proposed subnets mutual distillation with sandwich rule sampling and DKD loss for logits distillation. Used data from three robotic edge hardware types to train Latency Surrogate predictors for estimating hardware inference latency during search, enabling multi-objective evolutionary search balancing accuracy and latency.

Result: RAM-NAS models achieve 76.7% to 81.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Significantly reduces inference latency on edge hardware for robots. Experiments on downstream tasks show reduced inference time for detection and segmentation on all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods.

Conclusion: The work fills the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-awareness, providing efficient models suitable for robotic applications with balanced accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

*Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: JFTO framework enables robots to learn manipulation tasks from human video demonstrations by optimizing grasp poses and object trajectories while considering robot constraints, using SE(3) flow matching for probabilistic trajectory modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from human video demonstrations is scalable but challenging due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints between humans and robots.

Method: Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework that treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing grasp pose selection, trajectory imitation, and collision avoidance. Extends flow matching to SE(3) for probabilistic trajectory modeling.

Result: Validated in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse manipulation tasks, showing effective imitation while maintaining feasibility.

Conclusion: JFTO provides a unified differentiable optimization approach for video-based learning from demonstration that handles multimodal demonstrations and robot constraints effectively.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework for legged robots that replaces dense geometry with semantic reasoning and topological representations, using hierarchical vision-language perception and semantic-probabilistic mapping for improved navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robots are fragile under rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration.

Method: Uses hierarchical vision-language perception module for semantic inference, semantic-probabilistic topological map for coarse-to-fine planning with LLM-based global reasoning and vision-based local planning, integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success.

Conclusion: Introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to semantics-driven decision making.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to

*Yuxuan Zhou,Xingxing Li,Shengyu Li,Zhuohao Yan,Chunxi Xia,Shaoquan Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MASt3R-Fusion is a multi-sensor visual SLAM framework that integrates neural pointmap regression with inertial and GNSS data using Sim(3)-based constraints in a hierarchical factor graph for real-time pose tracking and globally consistent mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual SLAM struggles with low-texture environments and scale ambiguity, while neural pointmap regression methods discard the advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor fusion.

Method: Tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with inertial and GNSS data using Sim(3)-based visual alignment constraints in a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph with hierarchical design for real-time and global optimization.

Result: Substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems on public benchmarks and self-collected datasets.

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion successfully combines neural pointmap regression with multi-sensor fusion, enabling robust real-time SLAM with globally consistent mapping in challenging environments.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

*Jianbo Zhao,Taiyu Ban,Xiangjie Li,Xingtai Gui,Hangning Zhou,Lei Liu,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autoregressive models for autonomous driving planning suffer from spatio-temporal misalignment. The paper proposes TISA module for consistent ego-centric frame projection, kinematic action prediction for feasible trajectories, and multi-objective DPO for fine-grained behavior optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models have strong sequential modeling capabilities for autonomous driving planning, but their performance is limited by spatio-temporal misalignment where planners must condition future actions on past sensory data, creating an inconsistent worldview.

Method: Proposes Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module to project environmental features into consistent ego-centric frames, kinematic action prediction head for physically feasible trajectories, and multi-objective Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for fine-grained behavior learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models, demonstrating improved performance through worldview correction and fine-grained optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses spatio-temporal misalignment in autoregressive planning models through TISA module and multi-objective DPO, enabling consistent worldview and fine-grained behavior optimization for improved autonomous driving performance.

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KeyWorld is a framework that accelerates robotic world models by focusing computation on semantic key frames and using lightweight interpolation for intermediate frames, achieving 5.68× speedup while improving physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic world models suffer from slow inference speed due to frame-to-frame generation redundancy and lack physical plausibility in generated trajectories, limiting real-world applications.

Method: KeyWorld identifies significant motion transitions to obtain key frames, uses a DiT model to generate these key frames from text descriptions, and employs a lightweight interpolator to fill intermediate frames.

Result: On LIBERO benchmark, KeyWorld achieves 5.68× acceleration compared to frame-to-frame baseline and generates more physically valid videos, especially on complex tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical path toward deploying efficient and effective world models in real-time robotic control and other domains requiring both speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

### [196] [Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21107)
*William Barron,Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CrossInstruct enables robots to learn behaviors from cross-modal instructions (text labels and annotations) instead of physical demonstrations, using a vision-language model to synthesize motion trajectories that can be refined with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot teaching requires cumbersome motion demonstrations via teleoperation or physical guidance, which doesn't scale well. There's a need for more scalable approaches using alternative instruction modalities.

Method: CrossInstruct framework integrates cross-modal instructions into a foundational VLM, which queries a fine-tuned model to synthesize motion over multiple 2D views, then fuses them into 3D trajectories. This is followed by reinforcement learning for policy refinement.

Result: The method produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the training examples, works effectively without additional fine-tuning, and provides strong initialization for reinforcement learning policies.

Conclusion: CrossInstruct offers a scalable alternative to physical demonstrations for robot teaching, leveraging cross-modal instructions and VLMs to generate behaviors that can be efficiently refined through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: ReasonNav is a modular robot navigation system that uses vision-language models to enable human-like navigation behaviors like reading signs and asking for directions, making navigation more efficient in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot navigation systems are inefficient in large environments because they lack human-like behaviors such as reading signs and asking for directions, which help humans navigate efficiently.

Method: The system uses a vision-language model (VLM) with compact input/output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning.

Result: Evaluation on real and simulated navigation tasks shows that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Conclusion: ReasonNav demonstrates that integrating human-like navigation skills through VLMs enables more efficient robot navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current synthetic data generation for code LLMs faces a 'verification ceiling' where data quality is limited by synthetic verifiers. The paper shows that rigid 100% pass criteria are too restrictive, and that allowing relaxed thresholds or LLM-based soft verification can recover valuable training data, improving performance by 2-4 points in pass@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'verification ceiling' bottleneck in synthetic data generation for code LLMs, where data quality and diversity are constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers.

Method: Systematically studied verification design and strategies by: (i) analyzing test complexity vs quantity, (ii) exploring relaxed pass thresholds and LLM-based soft verification, (iii) comparing formally correct vs incorrect solutions with human evaluation.

Result: Richer test suites improve code generation (+3 pass@1), relaxed verification recovers valuable data (2-4 point pass@1 improvement), and retaining diverse correct solutions yields consistent generalization gains.

Conclusion: Current verification practices are too rigid and filter out valuable diversity, but verification cannot be discarded. Combining calibrated verification with diverse problem-solution pairs can break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Motivation: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying become computationally intractable for large domains or long time horizons, requiring efficient surrogate models.

Method: Conditionally parameterized fully convolutional U-Net with convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, trained on short small-scale simulations but capable of temporal and spatial extrapolation.

Result: Achieves relative errors under 5% within training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times, with 16,000x computational speedup.

Conclusion: The method enables scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models, reducing simulation time from weeks to seconds.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing by better constraining the distribution of estimated abundance matrices.

Method: Uses optimal transport to measure discrepancy between targeted and true abundance distributions, incorporating this as a regularization term in an optimization problem. Demonstrated with an unsupervised deep learning approach.

Result: The method allows for better estimation of endmembers in highly mixed data and shows robustness to the choice of target abundance distribution.

Conclusion: The optimal transport-based regularization approach effectively improves blind hyperspectral unmixing performance in challenging mixed data scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phishing detection methods lack explainability and robustness against new attacks, motivating the need for character-level models that provide both detection capabilities and interpretability.

Method: Evaluated three character-level neural architectures on a custom email dataset under three scenarios: standard training/testing, adversarial attack testing, and adversarial training. Used Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: CharGRU performed best across all scenarios under limited computational resources. All models were vulnerable to adversarial attacks but adversarial training substantially improved robustness. Grad-CAM successfully visualized influential email parts.

Conclusion: Character-level deep learning models, particularly CharGRU, offer effective phishing detection with interpretability, and adversarial training enhances robustness against attacks.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

TL;DR: PMark is a semantic-level watermarking method for LLMs that uses proxy functions and multiple constraints to achieve distortion-free watermarking with strong robustness against paraphrasing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic-level watermarking methods lack strong theoretical guarantees and introduce distribution distortions through reject-sampling-based generation.

Method: Proposes PMark using proxy functions that map sentences to scalar values, dynamically estimates PF median through sampling, and enforces multiple PF constraints (channels) to strengthen watermark evidence.

Result: PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM baselines in both text quality and robustness, achieving distortion-free property and improved robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks.

Conclusion: PMark offers a more effective paradigm for detecting machine-generated text with solid theoretical guarantees and improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at

TL;DR: BlockFUL is a dual-chain blockchain framework that enables efficient unlearning in federated learning through parallel and sequential paradigms using gradient-ascent and re-training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in federated learning is challenging due to complex inheritance relationships, especially when blockchain is used for integrity, requiring editing multiple interlinked records and updating inherited models.

Method: Proposed BlockFUL with dual-chain structure (live chain and archive chain), two unlearning paradigms (parallel and sequential), implemented through gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based methods.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 show reduced data dependency and operational overhead, improving unlearning performance.

Conclusion: BlockFUL effectively enhances unlearning capabilities in blockchained federated learning through its dual-chain structure and novel unlearning paradigms.

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

### [204] [RadAgents: Multimodal Agentic Reasoning for Chest X-ray Interpretation with Radiologist-like Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20490)
*Kai Zhang,Corey D Barrett,Jangwon Kim,Lichao Sun,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RadAgents is a multi-agent framework for chest X-ray interpretation that addresses limitations in clinical interpretability, multimodal fusion, and inconsistency resolution through clinical priors, task-aware reasoning, and verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic systems for CXR interpretation lack clinically interpretable reasoning aligned with guidelines, insufficiently fuse multimodal evidence, and fail to detect/resolve cross-tool inconsistencies without verification mechanisms.

Method: Multi-agent framework that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning, integrates grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts.

Result: The system produces outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice by addressing the identified gaps in existing methods.

Conclusion: RadAgents bridges critical gaps in CXR interpretation by providing clinically aligned, multimodal reasoning with verification mechanisms for improved reliability and transparency in medical AI systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

### [205] [Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317)
*Jiakai Tang,Yujie Luo,Xunke Xi,Fei Sun,Xueyang Feng,Sunhao Dai,Chao Yi,Dian Chen,Zhujin Gao,Yang Li,Xu Chen,Wen Chen,Jian Wu,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces IRF, an interactive recommendation paradigm using natural language commands, and RecBot, a dual-agent system that transforms linguistic expressions into preferences and dynamically adjusts recommendation policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback like likes/dislikes, which fail to capture nuanced user motivations and intentions, creating a gap between user intentions and system interpretations that undermines satisfaction and effectiveness.

Method: Developed RecBot with a dual-agent architecture: Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences, and Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for real-time policy adjustment. Used simulation-augmented knowledge distillation for efficient deployment.

Result: Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Conclusion: The IRF paradigm and RecBot system successfully address limitations of traditional recommender systems by enabling active explicit control through natural language commands, bridging the gap between user intentions and system interpretations.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

### [206] [Provenance Analysis of Archaeological Artifacts via Multimodal RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20769)
*Tuo Zhang,Yuechun Sun,Ruiliang Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A RAG-based system for archaeological artifact provenance analysis that integrates multimodal retrieval and vision-language models to support expert reasoning by identifying stylistically similar objects and generating structured attributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support expert reasoning in archaeology by alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora and providing concrete starting points for analysis through automated provenance analysis.

Method: Constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, uses raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects, and synthesizes retrieved candidates with VLMs to generate structured inferences.

Result: The system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs on Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly reducing cognitive burden.

Conclusion: The RAG-based system effectively supports archaeological provenance analysis by integrating multimodal retrieval and VLMs, demonstrating practical utility for expert scholars in navigating complex artifact corpora.

Abstract: In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system
for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert
reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models
(VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts
and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to
identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by
the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from
the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces
meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting
points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of
navigating vast comparative corpora.

*Huzaifa Sidhpurwala,Emily Fox,Garth Mollett,Florencio Cano Gabarda,Roman Zhukov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces HASC (Hazard-Aware System Card), a framework that enhances AI system transparency by integrating security/safety records with standardized identifiers like ASH IDs to complement existing CVEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for better transparency and accountability in AI system development and deployment by providing a comprehensive, dynamic record of security and safety posture.

Method: Proposes a standardized framework with novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) identifiers that complement existing security identifiers like CVEs, creating a single accessible source of truth for AI system safety information.

Result: Developed the HASC framework that enables clear communication of fixed flaws and supports informed decision-making about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle.

Conclusion: The HASC framework can complement ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard to provide greater transparency and accountability for AI systems by offering a standardized approach to documenting safety and security information.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater
transparency and accountability for AI systems.
