### [1] [Fair Play in the Newsroom: Actor-Based Filtering Gender Discrimination in Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13169)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extended pipeline for detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large language models using actor-level metrics for sentiment, syntactic agency, and quotation styles, applied to German newspaper corpus with improved gender balance but persistent subtle biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models reflect structural gender imbalances from training data, requiring better methods to detect and mitigate gender discrimination in text corpora.

Method: Extended actor-level pipeline with new metrics for sentiment asymmetry, syntactic agency, and quotation styles, supporting diagnostic analysis and exclusion-based balancing of corpora.

Result: Applied to taz2024full German newspaper corpus (1980-2024), showing substantial improvements in gender balance across multiple linguistic dimensions, though subtle biases in sentiment and framing persist.

Conclusion: Surface-level asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, but more work is needed to address subtler forms of bias; tools released to support discourse-based fairness auditing and equitable corpus construction.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

### [2] [MM-BrowseComp: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13186)
*Shilong Li,Xingyuan Bu,Wenjie Wang,Jiaheng Liu,Jun Dong,Haoyang He,Hao Lu,Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Zhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Jiayi Tian,Chenchen Zhang,Tianhao Peng,Yancheng He,Jihao Gu,Yuanxing Zhang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Wangchunshu Zhou,Zhaoxiang Zhang,Ruizhe Ding,Shilei Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp is a new multimodal web browsing benchmark with 224 hand-crafted questions that require processing both text and visual content, revealing significant limitations in current AI agents' multimodal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web browsing benchmarks focus primarily on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content (images, videos) that requires both visual and textual understanding for effective web navigation and information retrieval.

Method: Created 224 challenging questions with multimodal dependencies where prompts contain images and critical information is embedded in visual content on webpages. Provided verified checklists for fine-grained analysis of multimodal reasoning paths.

Result: Evaluation shows even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02% accuracy, demonstrating suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of native multimodal reasoning in current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: MM-BrowseComp highlights the significant gap in current AI agents' ability to handle multimodal web content and emphasizes the need for improved multimodal reasoning capabilities in web browsing agents.

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

### [3] [Overcoming Latency Bottlenecks in On-Device Speech Translation: A Cascaded Approach with Alignment-Based Streaming MT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13358)
*Zeeshan Ahmed,Frank Seide,Niko Moritz,Ju Lin,Ruiming Xie,Simone Merello,Zhe Liu,Christian Fuegen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Real-time streaming speech translation system that integrates ASR and MT with efficient techniques to balance translation quality and latency for on-device applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in real-time on-device streaming speech translation, particularly the difficulty of achieving streaming translation with low latency while maintaining quality compared to non-streaming systems.

Method: Propose simultaneous translation approach using RNN-T ASR systems, leverage linguistic cues from ASR for context management, and employ efficient beam-search pruning techniques (time-out and forced finalization) to maintain real-time performance.

Result: Outperforms baselines in both latency and quality metrics, significantly narrowing the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems for bilingual conversational speech translation.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enable more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation, paving the way for practical on-device streaming translation applications.

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

### [4] [Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13365)
*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning capabilities in LLMs have limited and varied effects on idiomaticity detection, with larger models showing modest improvements while smaller models benefit more from CoT reasoning and provided definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how reasoning capabilities affect idiomaticity detection performance in LLMs and examine the effect of model size, as idiomatic expressions require understanding before disambiguation and serve as basis for reasoning.

Method: Evaluated DeepSeek-R1 distillation models (1.5B to 70B parameters) across four idiomaticity detection datasets, testing chain-of-thought reasoning and providing definitions in prompts for smaller models.

Result: Smaller models show performance increase with CoT reasoning from math-tuned models but not reaching base model levels; larger models show modest improvements. Larger models demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity while smaller models often fail to output actual meanings.

Conclusion: Reasoning effect on idiomaticity detection is smaller and more varied than expected, with model size being a significant factor. Providing definitions can help smaller models improve performance in some cases.

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

### [5] [Whispering Context: Distilling Syntax and Semantics for Long Speech Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13376)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enhancing ASR performance in long audio transcripts by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper using token-level distillation with optimal transport and representation loss minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy in long audio transcripts, which impacts downstream tasks like Named Entity Recognition, capitalization, and punctuation.

Method: Two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to align dimensions and sequence lengths, (2) representation loss minimization between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA to blend syntax and semantics.

Result: Significant improvements in Word Error Rate, NER, capitalization, and punctuation success on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset with long audios and rich entities.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the value of integrating linguistic context into transcription and sets a foundation for robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

### [6] [Datarus-R1: An Adaptive Multi-Step Reasoning LLM for Automated Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13382)
*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B is a 14B-parameter model fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct that acts as a virtual data analyst and problem solver, trained on full analytical trajectories with dual reasoning interfaces and achieving superior performance with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a language model that can perform complex quantitative analysis and problem solving by learning from complete analytical workflows rather than isolated Q&A pairs, addressing issues like format collapse and verbosity in RL-aligned models.

Method: Training pipeline includes: 1) trajectory-centric synthetic data generator producing 144K notebook episodes, 2) dual-reward framework with structural tags and Hierarchical Reward Model, 3) memory-optimized GRPO implementation with KV-cache reuse and curriculum learning, and 4) dual reasoning interfaces (agentic ReAct mode and reflection CoT mode).

Result: Datarus surpasses similar-size models and reaches performance of larger reasoning models like QwQ-32B, achieving 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

Conclusion: The trajectory-based training approach with dual interfaces enables efficient, high-quality problem solving with reduced verbosity and improved convergence patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of comprehensive analytical workflow learning.

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

### [7] [ALIGN: Word Association Learning for Cross-Cultural Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426)
*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' word associations improves cultural alignment in LLMs, boosting association accuracy and shifting value responses toward target cultures without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs reflect distributional biases from their training data, lacking cultural alignment. There's a need for cost-effective methods to model and align culture using limited cultural knowledge.

Method: Fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based preference optimization on native speakers' free word-association norms from English-US and Mandarin.

Result: SFT improved association Precision at 5 by 16-20% (English) and 43-165% (Mandarin), increased concreteness by +0.20, achieved human-level valence/arousal. Models shifted answer distributions toward target culture on World-Values-Survey, with Chinese-aligned responses doubling and US bias dropping by one-third.

Conclusion: A few million culture-grounded associations can effectively instill value alignment without expensive retraining. 7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing promise for cognitively-grounded cultural alignment approaches.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

### [8] [ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514)
*Hongxin Ding,Baixiang Huang,Yue Fang,Weibin Liao,Xinke Jiang,Zheng Li,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMed is a reinforcement learning framework that transforms medical LLMs from reactive to proactive question-asking systems using Shapley Information Gain rewards to improve diagnostic accuracy in interactive clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLMs operate reactively by generating answers without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in interactive clinical consultations where physicians need to actively gather information from patients.

Method: A two-stage RL framework: 1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization using Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct high-reward interaction trajectories, and 2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions.

Result: ProMed outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.

Conclusion: The ProMed framework successfully transitions medical LLMs to a proactive paradigm, enabling them to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy in interactive medical settings.

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

### [9] [Saudi-Dialect-ALLaM: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Dialectal Arabic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13525)
*Hassan Barmandah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA-tuning of ALLaM-7B for Saudi dialect generation using synthetic instruction data, achieving significant improvements in dialect control and text fidelity compared to generic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic LLMs are dominated by Modern Standard Arabic with limited support for Saudi dialects like Najdi and Hijazi, hindering authentic dialectal variation capture.

Method: Used privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset (5,466 synthetic pairs) to LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview. Tested two variants: Dialect-Token (prepends dialect tag) and No-Token training. Evaluated with external dialect classifier, text fidelity metrics (chrF++, BERTScore), and diversity measures.

Result: Dialect-Token model achieved best control: Saudi rate increased from 47.97% to 84.21%, MSA leakage reduced from 32.63% to 6.21%. Fidelity improved (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both variants outperformed generic instruction models in dialect control and fidelity.

Conclusion: LoRA-tuning with explicit dialect control tokens effectively enables Saudi dialect generation while maintaining text quality, outperforming existing Arabic LLMs without metadata-tag echoing issues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

### [10] [MATA (māta): Mindful Assessment of the Telugu Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13526)
*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATA is a new Telugu language evaluation dataset with 729 questions to test LLMs' capabilities, revealing their reliance on superficial heuristics and comparing automated vs human evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess Large Language Models' abilities in Telugu language and understand their limitations through fine-grained evaluation, which is essential for developing more linguistically capable models.

Method: Created a dataset of 729 multiple-choice and open-ended questions spanning diverse linguistic dimensions, evaluated 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs, analyzed performance patterns, and compared LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation.

Result: LLMs were found to rely on superficial heuristics like answer position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. The study also provided insights into the reliability of automated evaluation compared to human evaluation for open-ended questions in a low-resource language.

Conclusion: Fine-grained evaluation is crucial for understanding model limitations and can guide development of better Telugu language models, while also serving as a foundation for future Telugu NLP research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

### [11] [Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13533)
*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compressed deep learning models may achieve similar accuracy to original large models but lack trust-equivalence due to poor interpretability alignment and calibration mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if compressed models can be trusted as drop-in replacements for large models, going beyond just accuracy metrics to assess interpretability and calibration equivalence.

Method: Proposed a two-dimensional trust-equivalence framework: 1) Interpretability alignment using LIME and SHAP tests to check if models use same input features, 2) Calibration similarity using ECE, MCE, Brier Score and reliability diagrams. Tested on BERT-base and its compressed variants for text classification tasks.

Result: Found low interpretability alignment and significant calibration mismatch even when accuracies were nearly identical between compressed and original models.

Conclusion: Compressed models are not trust-equivalent to their large counterparts. Deployment requires careful assessment beyond performance parity metrics.

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

### [12] [A Comparative Study of Decoding Strategies in Medical Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580)
*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Decoding strategies significantly impact LLM performance in medical tasks, with deterministic methods like beam search outperforming stochastic approaches, and medical LLMs showing no overall advantage over general models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different decoding strategies affect text generation quality in healthcare applications where accuracy is critical, as this area remains underexplored despite its importance.

Method: Evaluated 11 decoding strategies across five medical tasks (translation, summarization, QA, dialogue, image captioning) using both medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of various sizes, with multiple evaluation metrics.

Result: Deterministic strategies (especially beam search) outperformed stochastic ones; larger models had higher scores but longer inference times; medical LLMs showed no overall performance advantage and were more sensitive to decoding choices; MAUVE metric showed weak agreement with BERTScore/ROUGE.

Conclusion: Careful selection of decoding methods is crucial in medical applications as their influence can sometimes exceed that of model choice, highlighting the need for decoding strategy optimization in healthcare LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

### [13] [Who Gets the Mic? Investigating Gender Bias in the Speaker Assignment of a Speech-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603)
*Dariia Puhach,Amir H. Payberah,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech-LLMs like Bark show gender awareness in speaker selection but no systematic bias, unlike text models where gender bias is implicit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Speech-LLMs exhibit gender bias similar to text-based LLMs, using speaker assignment as an explicit bias indicator since these models must produce gendered voices.

Method: Evaluated Bark TTS model's default speaker assignments for textual prompts using two datasets: (i) gender-stereotyped professions and (ii) words with gendered connotations.

Result: Bark does not show systematic gender bias in speaker selection, but demonstrates gender awareness and some gender inclinations.

Conclusion: Speech-LLMs exhibit different bias patterns than text models - while showing gender awareness, they don't demonstrate systematic bias in voice assignment, suggesting different mechanisms for gender representation.

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation

*Tomer Ashuach,Dana Arad,Aaron Mueller,Martin Tutek,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP is a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning in LLMs using sparse autoencoders to identify and suppress harmful knowledge while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE-based unlearning methods operate at inference time and can be bypassed by malicious actors, requiring persistent parameter changes for reliable concept removal.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders to automatically identify salient features across multiple layers and suppresses their activations through parameter-efficient interventions.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning tasks from WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while preserving general and in-domain capabilities.

Conclusion: CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign concepts, enabling precise suppression of harmful features with persistent parameter changes.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs perform poorly on Vietnamese educational assessments, with only one model barely exceeding average human performance but still far below human best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well vision language models trained on English data can handle real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning in Vietnamese educational contexts.

Method: Created ViExam benchmark with 2,548 multimodal questions across 7 academic domains, tested state-of-the-art and open-source VLMs, experimented with cross-lingual prompting and human-in-the-loop collaboration.

Result: SOTA VLMs achieved only 57.74% accuracy, open-source models 27.70%, most underperformed average humans (66.54%). Only o3 model exceeded human average (74.07%) but still far from human best (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting decreased performance, human collaboration improved by 5%.

Conclusion: Current VLMs struggle with Vietnamese multimodal educational content, highlighting significant cross-lingual performance gaps and the need for better multilingual multimodal training approaches.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

### [17] [Generics and Default Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13718)
*James Ravi Kirkpatrick,Rachel Katharine Sterken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of 28 LLMs on defeasible reasoning with generics shows wide performance variation, with CoT prompting often degrading performance and models struggling to distinguish defeasible vs deductive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in handling defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations that are central to non-monotonic logic and important for default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.

Method: Tested 28 large language models on 20 defeasible reasoning patterns using different prompting styles (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with generic generalizations like 'Birds fly' and 'Ravens are black'.

Result: Performance varied widely across models and prompting styles. Few-shot prompting modestly improved some models, but chain-of-thought prompting often caused significant performance degradation (-11.14% mean accuracy drop). Most models failed to distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpreted generics as universal statements.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both promise and significant limitations in default reasoning, particularly in handling the exception-permitting nature of generic statements and distinguishing different types of logical inference.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

### [18] [Prediction is not Explanation: Revisiting the Explanatory Capacity of Mapping Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13729)
*Hanna Herasimchyk,Alhassan Abdelhalim,Sören Laue,Michaela Regneri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prediction accuracy in feature norm mapping methods doesn't reliably indicate genuine semantic knowledge in word embeddings, as these methods can predict even random information due to algorithmic upper bounds rather than meaningful semantic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that accurate prediction of semantic features from word embeddings implies the embeddings contain corresponding knowledge, and to improve interpretability of AI systems by understanding what knowledge is truly encoded.

Method: Examination of common methods that map word embeddings onto human-interpretable semantic features (feature norms), demonstrating that these methods can successfully predict random information and are constrained by algorithmic upper bounds.

Result: Prediction accuracy alone does not indicate genuine feature-based interpretability; results are predominantly determined by algorithmic constraints rather than meaningful semantic representation, and geometric similarity in vector spaces is primarily reflected rather than semantic properties.

Conclusion: Comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance are unreliable for determining which dataset is better captured by word embeddings, as current mapping methods primarily reflect geometric similarity rather than genuine semantic knowledge emergence.

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

TL;DR: EEG-MedRAG is a hypergraph-based framework that integrates EEG data, patient cases, and medical knowledge for improved clinical decision support through semantic-temporal retrieval and diagnostic generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently retrieve and interpret large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data for neuroscience and clinical applications, addressing challenges in handling diverse EEG data sources and enabling better diagnostic support.

Method: A three-layer hypergraph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge, individual patient cases, and large-scale repositories into a traversable n-ary relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and causal-chain diagnostic generation.

Result: EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval performance, demonstrating strong potential for real-world clinical decision support.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses EEG data retrieval and interpretation challenges, showing superior performance over existing methods and offering practical value for clinical applications through its publicly available implementation.

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

### [20] [Sycophancy under Pressure: Evaluating and Mitigating Sycophantic Bias via Adversarial Dialogues in Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13743)
*Kaiwei Zhang,Qi Jia,Zijian Chen,Wei Sun,Xiangyang Zhu,Chunyi Li,Dandan Zhu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit sycophancy - aligning with user beliefs over facts, especially problematic in scientific QA. The paper introduces an evaluation framework and Pressure-Tune method to measure and mitigate this behavior while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sycophancy in LLMs poses serious risks in high-stakes scientific contexts where factual accuracy is crucial, but this phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA settings.

Method: Developed a unified evaluation framework with adversarial prompting and metrics (misleading/sycophancy resistance). Proposed Pressure-Tune - lightweight post-training with synthetic adversarial dialogues and chain-of-thought rationales that reject misinformation.

Result: Systematic evaluations revealed pervasive sycophantic tendencies across models, driven more by alignment strategy than model size. Pressure-Tune significantly enhanced sycophancy resistance without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback.

Conclusion: Pressure-Tune offers a practical solution to mitigate sycophancy in LLMs, enabling more truthful and principled model behavior in scientific QA contexts while maintaining model responsiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

*Shengchao Liu,Xiaoming Liu,Chengzhengxu Li,Zhaohan Zhang,Guoxin Ma,Yu Lan,Shuai Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MGT-Prism is a machine-generated text detection method that uses frequency domain analysis to improve domain generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by ~0.9% on accuracy and F1 score across 11 test datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-generated text detectors perform well within the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains due to domain shift between different data sources.

Method: Analyzes text representations in frequency domain, uses low frequency domain filtering to remove domain-sensitive features, and employs dynamic spectrum alignment to extract domain-invariant features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: Frequency domain analysis provides consistent spectral patterns across domains and reveals significant magnitude discrepancies between machine-generated and human-written texts, enabling better domain generalization for detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

### [22] [Can Large Language Models (LLMs) Describe Pictures Like Children? A Comparative Corpus Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13769)
*Hanna Woloszyn,Benjamin Gagl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated text differs significantly from child language - longer, less lexically rich, uses more high-frequency words, under-represents nouns, and shows low semantic similarity despite few-shot prompting attempts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can replicate child-like language for educational applications, as little attention has been paid to this aspect despite increasing use of LLMs in education.

Method: Generated two LLM corpora using German picture stories with zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying general age, then compared to real children's descriptions using psycholinguistic analysis of word frequency, lexical richness, sentence/word length, POS tags, and semantic similarity with word embeddings.

Result: LLM-generated texts were longer but less lexically rich, relied more on high-frequency words, under-represented nouns, and showed low semantic similarity. Few-shot prompts only slightly increased similarities but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns of child language.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle to accurately replicate child language patterns, raising questions about their appropriateness for child-directed educational tools, though the study provides insights for psycholinguistic research and multimodal prompting approaches.

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TracSum is a new benchmark for traceable, aspect-based medical document summarization with sentence-level citations to verify factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about factual accuracy in LLM-generated medical summaries by enabling users to trace evidence back to original sources through citations.

Method: Created benchmark with 500 annotated medical abstracts across 7 aspects (3.5K summary-citation pairs), proposed evaluation framework with 4 metrics, and developed Track-Then-Sum baseline pipeline.

Result: TracSum effectively benchmarks traceable summarization. Explicit sentence-level tracking improves accuracy, and full context incorporation enhances completeness.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables reliable evaluation of traceable medical summarization, with tracking-before-summarization approach proving beneficial for factual accuracy.

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale Bayesian evaluation shows top AI language models rank among top 25% of human annotators in moral understanding, with better balanced accuracy and fewer false negatives than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models comprehend moral dimensions compared to humans, addressing limitations of prior deterministic evaluation methods that ignore human disagreement.

Method: Developed GPU-optimized Bayesian framework to model annotator disagreements (aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty), evaluated top models (Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on 100K+ texts from social media, news, and forums.

Result: AI models typically rank among top 25% of human annotators with much better-than-average balanced accuracy, and produce far fewer false negatives than humans, indicating more sensitive moral detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Large language models demonstrate superior moral detection sensitivity compared to average human performance, ranking among the top human annotators in moral understanding tasks.

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

*Juncheng Xie,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A prompt-based one-shot strategy that uses countdown markers enables LLMs to generate exactly the desired number of tokens without fine-tuning, achieving over 95% length compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with precise length control, frequently overshooting or undershooting explicit length instructions due to inability to reliably maintain internal token counts.

Method: Appends countdown markers and explicit counting rules to prompts, forcing the model to 'write while counting' in a one-shot approach without fine-tuning or iterative sampling.

Result: On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 improved from below 30% to above 95%, surpassing draft-then-revise baseline while preserving answer quality.

Conclusion: Precise length control can be achieved through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to training- or decoding-based methods.

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

*Maria Paz Oliva,Adriana Correia,Ivan Vankov,Viktor Botev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current automatic evaluation metrics for NLG have limitations and no single metric works perfectly across all tasks, with challenges persisting even in newer LLM-based evaluators and RAG evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural Language Generation evaluation is crucial for AI adoption but human evaluation is expensive and lacks scalability, while existing automatic metrics have significant limitations and inconsistent validation practices.

Method: Conducted thorough examination of existing metrics' methodologies, documented strengths/limitations, validation methods, and correlations with human judgment across different tasks and datasets.

Result: Identified key challenges: metrics capture only specific text quality aspects, effectiveness varies by task/dataset, validation practices are unstructured, and human judgment correlations are inconsistent - issues that persist in LLM-as-a-Judge and RAG evaluation.

Conclusion: Challenges the quest for a 'perfect metric', recommends selecting metrics based on task-specific needs with complementary evaluations, and advocates for new metrics to focus on enhanced validation methodologies.

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Motivation: To automate the extraction of requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification documents in the construction industry, addressing the need for efficient processing of technical documentation.

Method: Used Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques with transformer-based CamemBERT model and French language model Fr_core_news_lg. Applied transfer learning and compared with rule-based and deep learning methods. For RE, implemented four supervised models including Random Forest with custom feature vectors.

Result: CamemBERT and Fr_core_news_lg achieved superior NER performance with F1-scores over 90%. Random Forest was most effective for RE with F1 score above 80%. Results based on hand-crafted annotated dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates high-performance automated extraction of requirements from French construction documents, with plans to represent outcomes as a knowledge graph for enhanced automatic verification systems.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a

### [28] [MME-SCI: A Comprehensive and Challenging Science Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13938)
*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI is a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' scientific reasoning across 4 subjects, 5 languages, and 3 evaluation modes, revealing significant performance gaps in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific benchmarks for MLLMs lack multilingual evaluation, comprehensive modality coverage assessment, and fine-grained knowledge point annotation, creating gaps in understanding model capabilities.

Method: Collected 1,019 high-quality QA pairs covering math, physics, chemistry, and biology across 5 languages (Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Japanese) with 3 distinct evaluation modes, then tested 20 models (16 open-source, 4 closed-source).

Result: MME-SCI proved highly challenging - o4-mini achieved only 52.11% (math), 24.73% (physics), 36.57% (chemistry), and 29.80% (biology) accuracy in image-only mode, significantly higher difficulty than existing benchmarks. Multilingual analysis revealed domain-specific weaknesses.

Conclusion: MME-SCI provides a more comprehensive and challenging evaluation framework that exposes critical limitations in current MLLMs' scientific reasoning capabilities, particularly in multilingual and modality-diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding factors driving customer review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business performance in the hospitality industry.

Method: Transforms textual reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples with sentiment scores, then uses graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features with machine learning classifiers for rating prediction.

Result: Performs similar to state-of-the-art models but with lower computational cost, achieves comparable performance to LLMs, outperforms traditional NLP baselines on agreement metrics like Cohen's Kappa, and offers better interpretability.

Conclusion: Graph-based representations show strong potential for review analytics, with advantages in interpretability and integration into RAG systems, laying groundwork for future research with advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM extraction methods.

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongMab-PO uses Multi-Armed Bandit strategy to select informative context chunks for generating diverse, high-quality responses, then applies DPO training to improve long-context LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for enhancing LLM long-context capabilities suffer from low diversity and factual inconsistencies in synthetic training data, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a framework that treats context chunks as MAB arms, selects chunks based on reward scores to generate responses, iteratively updates scores based on feedback, and applies DPO training on collected responses.

Result: Significantly improves diversity and quality of preference data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The MAB rollout strategy effectively identifies informative context segments, enabling generation of high-quality diverse responses that lead to superior long-context modeling performance through DPO optimization.

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

*Xiao Liang,Zhongzhi Li,Yeyun Gong,Yelong Shen,Ying Nian Wu,Zhijiang Guo,Weizhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SvS strategy maintains policy entropy during RLVR training by using self-play with variational problem synthesis, improving Pass@k performance significantly across multiple reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RLVR training improves Pass@1 but reduces policy entropy and generation diversity, limiting Pass@k performance which represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability.

Method: Online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy that uses policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while keeping reference answers identical to originals.

Result: Achieved absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 on AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, with consistent improvements across 12 reasoning benchmarks from 3B to 32B model sizes.

Conclusion: SvS effectively maintains policy entropy during training, sustains prolonged improvements, and demonstrates generalizability and robustness across various model sizes and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

*Dongyoon Hahm,Taywon Min,Woogyeol Jin,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs for agentic tasks can unintentionally make them misaligned and more likely to execute harmful requests. PING method uses natural language prefixes to guide agents to refuse harmful tasks while maintaining performance on benign ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns are often overlooked when fine-tuning LLMs for agentic capabilities, leading to unintentional misalignment where models become more likely to execute harmful tasks and less likely to refuse them.

Method: Proposed Prefix INjection Guard (PING) - an iterative approach that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses. The method alternates between generating candidate prefixes and selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior.

Result: PING significantly enhances safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing effectiveness. Outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in web navigation and code generation tasks. Analysis shows prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification.

Conclusion: PING provides a simple yet effective solution to safety challenges in agentic LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating that carefully crafted natural language prefixes can effectively guide model behavior while maintaining performance on legitimate tasks.

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

TL;DR: LLMs with expert-guided in-context learning outperform traditional methods in healthcare sentiment analysis, achieving expert-level accuracy without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital health analytics face challenges with complex patient-generated content requiring scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in healthcare.

Method: Developed a structured codebook encoding expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting. Tested six GPT models alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 against BioBERT variants and lexicon-based methods using 400 expert-annotated posts from Online Health Communities.

Result: LLMs achieved superior performance with expert-level agreement, showing no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement levels, suggesting knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern recognition.

Conclusion: LLMs with in-context learning offer a scalable solution for digital health analytics, addressing expert knowledge shortage and enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for patient monitoring and evidence-based health strategies.

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR is a lightweight object detection model for real-time driver fatigue detection, featuring Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module and Rectangular Calibration Module to improve feature expressiveness and spatial localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver fatigue detection is crucial for road safety, but existing methods are either intrusive (physiological/vehicle-based) or have limitations in detecting small/occluded objects and multi-scale features (vision-based).

Method: Proposes YOLO11-CR with two key modules: CAFM (integrates CNN local features with Transformer global context) and RCM (captures horizontal/vertical contextual information for better spatial localization).

Result: Achieves 87.17% precision, 83.86% recall, 88.09% mAP@50, and 55.93% mAP@50-95 on DSM dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models. Ablation studies confirm module effectiveness.

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR provides a practical high-performance solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring with strong real-world deployment potential and future enhancement opportunities.

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage-R1 is a vision-language model with reflective reasoning that achieves state-of-the-art performance for in-the-wild AI-generated image detection, outperforming existing detectors by 5-10% on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images pose significant threats to information security and public trust, but existing detectors fail to generalize to real-world scenarios where images are noisy and vary from obviously fake to highly realistic content.

Method: Proposes Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning mechanism. Uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning, with inference-time adaptive thinking strategy for balancing speed and accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mirage-R1 leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% on the proposed Mirage benchmark and 10% on public benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in real-world AIGI detection.

Conclusion: The proposed Mirage benchmark and Mirage-R1 model effectively address the challenge of in-the-wild AI-generated image detection, providing robust performance through reflective reasoning and adaptive inference strategies.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1 is a reasoning-enhanced framework that combines vision-language models with expert OCR tools to reduce hallucinations and improve document recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from hallucinations and underperform specialized OCR models. The paper aims to address these limitations by integrating reasoning capabilities with expert tools.

Method: Proposes a reasoning-and-tool interleaved framework where the model first uses its own OCR capabilities, then calls expert models for reference results, and finally rethinks the reasoning process to provide final recognition.

Result: Experimental results on ReST and OmniDocBench show that DianJin-OCR-R1 consistently outperforms both non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models.

Conclusion: The reasoning-enhanced framework effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves OCR performance by leveraging expert models as references, providing a cost-effective way to enhance VLM capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: Proposed a CNN-based Urdu OCR system using component classification with automatic feature learning, achieving 99% accuracy on ligature components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu's cursive script and complex structure make traditional segmentation-based recognition error-prone, requiring a more effective approach for character classification.

Method: Used convolutional neural networks trained on Urdu text dataset generated through character permutations, with connected component technique to isolate ligatures and hierarchical neural network for component classification.

Result: Achieved 99% accuracy for component classification on the Urdu text dataset.

Conclusion: CNN-based component classification is highly effective for Urdu OCR, overcoming challenges of segmentation-based approaches and complex script morphology.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE is a curriculum learning framework that improves ulcerative colitis severity classification from endoscopic images by accounting for label noise and ordinal structure, using image quality as a proxy for annotation confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) classification is challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score, which standard models often ignore.

Method: Proposes CLoE framework that uses image quality (estimated via BBPS labels) as proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy to hard, combined with ResizeMix augmentation for robustness.

Result: Achieves 82.5% accuracy and QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC dataset with ConvNeXt-Tiny, outperforming supervised and self-supervised baselines on both LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware training strategies like CLoE show strong potential for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released

### [40] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter is a diffusion-based framework that generates realistic gait silhouette sequences to address dataset limitations in gait recognition, enabling controllable generation and privacy-preserving synthetic identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gait recognition lacks large-scale labeled datasets and faces challenges in collecting diverse gait samples while preserving privacy. Current methods rely on simulated environments or alternative generative models.

Method: Trains a video diffusion model from scratch exclusively on gait silhouette data to generate temporally consistent and identity-preserving sequences. Allows conditioning on covariates like clothing, carried objects, and view angle. Introduces identity embedding interpolation to create novel synthetic identities.

Result: Synthetic samples improve gait recognition performance, especially under challenging conditions. Generated novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns useful for training while maintaining privacy of real subjects.

Conclusion: GaitCrafter represents an important advancement in using diffusion models for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation, addressing key limitations in the field.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive is a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving that reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving face significant computational overhead from processing high-resolution multi-view images, which increases inference latency and memory consumption due to quadratic attention complexity.

Method: Proposes two innovations: 1) diversity-aware token selection using farthest point sampling for semantic and spatial coverage, and 2) view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal pruning ratios per camera view based on task importance.

Result: Achieves 6.40× speedup in prefilling phase and consumes only 13.4% of original FLOPs when retaining 10% of visual tokens, with only 3% performance drop on DriveLM benchmark.

Conclusion: Prune2Drive provides an effective solution for deploying VLMs in autonomous driving by significantly reducing computational costs without requiring model retraining or access to attention maps.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [42] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH is a differentiable meta-attack framework that strategically composes existing Lp-based attacks to generate perceptually aligned adversarial examples with superior visual quality and attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Lp-norm bounded adversarial examples often fail to align with human perception, and it's unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can improve perceptual efficacy. There's a need for effective perceptually aligned adversarial examples.

Method: DAASH operates in a multi-stage fashion, aggregating candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned adaptive weights. It uses a novel meta-loss function that jointly minimizes misclassification loss and perceptual distortion, dynamically modulating each base attack's contribution.

Result: DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks like AdvAD, achieving 20.63% higher attack success rates and superior visual quality (SSIM, LPIPS, FID improvements of ≈11, 0.015, and 5.7 respectively) on adversarially trained models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

Conclusion: DAASH effectively leverages Lp-constrained base attacks to generate perceptually superior adversarial examples, generalizes well to unseen defenses, and provides a practical baseline for robustness evaluation without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide objective, quantitative evaluation of facial plastic surgery outcomes for better surgical planning, patient counseling, and outcome assessment across different practices.

Method: Leverages automated landmark detection, geometric facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal morphology analysis on paired pre- and post-operative facial photographs from the largest curated dataset to date.

Result: 96.2% of rhinoplasty patients showed improvement in at least one nasal measurement; 77.0% improved alar width to face width ratio; 71.3% of broader cohort showed significant enhancements in facial symmetry or perceived age; 99.5-99.6% patient identity consistency post-operation.

Conclusion: The framework provides reproducible quantitative benchmarks and facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Motivation: Large language models face adoption barriers in healthcare due to high computational costs, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns, creating a need for more practical solutions.

Method: Evaluated multiple small language models on NIH Chest X-ray dataset for AP vs. PA classification using three prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts.

Result: Certain small language models achieved competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, demonstrating that prompt engineering can significantly enhance SLM performance without requiring deep AI expertise.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering enables small language models to perform effectively in healthcare applications, providing a viable alternative to large models while addressing computational, accessibility, and privacy constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [46] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) in multiple-choice VQA benchmarks where VLMs can guess answers using only vision and options without questions, and introduces GroundAttack to generate hard negative options for more realistic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple-choice VQA benchmarks contain a bias that allows vision-language models to select correct answers without understanding the questions, leading to inflated performance metrics that don't reflect true QA capabilities.

Method: The authors develop GroundAttack, an automated toolkit that generates visually plausible hard negative options to eliminate the EOB by balancing visual relevance between correct and incorrect options.

Result: When applied to NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, the new EOB-free annotations cause current VLMs to drop to near-random accuracy under vision+option settings and non-saturated performance under full question+vision+option settings.

Conclusion: The proposed GroundAttack method successfully creates more challenging VQA benchmarks that provide realistic evaluation of VLMs' true question-answering abilities by removing the easy-options shortcut.

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge distillation framework using structured prompting with large VLMs (GPT-4o and o3-mini) to train compact 3B-scale VISTA model for highway scene understanding and traffic risk assessment, achieving strong performance with efficient edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches struggle with scalability and generalization in complex real-world traffic environments, necessitating more robust and efficient solutions for intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving.

Method: Structured Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy with two large VLMs to generate knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations, followed by supervised fine-tuning of a smaller 3B-scale student model (VISTA) for traffic scene analysis.

Result: VISTA achieves strong performance on captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr) comparable to teacher models despite significantly reduced parameters, enabling low-resolution video understanding and risk-aware caption generation.

Conclusion: Effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities, facilitating efficient deployment on edge devices for real-time risk monitoring without extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

### [48] [EDTalk++: Full Disentanglement for Controllable Talking Head Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13442)
*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTalk++ is a novel framework for controllable talking head generation that achieves full disentanglement of facial motions (mouth, pose, eyes, expression) using orthogonal latent spaces and shared visual priors for both video and audio inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking head generation methods lack proper disentanglement of facial features, causing mutual interference between different motions and failing to share visual priors across different input modalities like video and audio.

Method: Uses four lightweight modules to decompose facial dynamics into four orthogonal latent spaces (mouth, pose, eye, expression) with learnable bases. Enforces orthogonality for independence and efficient training. Stores bases in banks for shared visual priors with audio input. Includes Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven synthesis.

Result: The framework enables individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional expression while accommodating both video and audio input modalities effectively.

Conclusion: EDTalk++ successfully addresses the disentanglement challenge in talking head generation, providing independent control over multiple facial motions and supporting diverse input modalities through its novel orthogonal latent space approach.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kidney stone classification is crucial for personalized treatment but CNN-based models have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies under variable imaging conditions, necessitating more robust approaches.

Method: Comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models (ResNet50) on two ex vivo datasets with CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images, using ViT-base pretrained on ImageNet-21k.

Result: ViT consistently outperformed ResNet50 across all conditions: 95.2% accuracy vs 64.5% in complex endoscopic images, and 87.1% vs 78.4% in mixed-view CCD images, with similar improvements in F1-score, precision and recall.

Conclusion: ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis, demonstrating better handling of complex imaging conditions.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

*Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Yuxin Cheng,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR proposes sharing intermediate layers across multiple images in Implicit Neural Representations to reduce parameter count by 60% while maintaining performance on image reconstruction and super-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Implicit Neural Representations use separate neural networks for each image, leading to computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multiple images.

Method: Share intermediate layers across multiple images while keeping input/output layers image-specific, plus adding a novel projection layer per image to capture unique features. Based on analysis showing similar weight distributions in intermediate layers of trained INRs.

Result: Saves up to 60% parameters while maintaining comparable performance, scales effectively to handle 100 images with average PSNR of 34 dB, and proves robust across various backbones.

Conclusion: MINR provides an efficient parameter-sharing approach for multi-image encoding in implicit neural representations without sacrificing reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

### [53] [Distribution-Aware Hadamard Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13478)
*Wenyong Zhou,Jiachen Ren,Taiqiang Wu,Yuxin Cheng,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHQ is a distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that quantizes both weights and activations in Implicit Neural Representations, achieving significant hardware efficiency gains through distribution standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs require full-precision computation which causes significant hardware overhead. Previous quantization methods only focused on weights, offering limited savings due to lack of activation quantization.

Method: Proposed DHQ uses Hadamard transformation to standardize diverse weight and activation distributions into a unified bell-shaped form before applying standard quantization, addressing the distinct distribution patterns in different layers.

Result: DHQ reduces latency by 32.7%, energy consumption by 40.1%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3% compared to full-precision INRs while maintaining performance on image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: The distribution-aware Hadamard quantization approach effectively addresses the hardware inefficiency of INRs by simultaneously quantizing both weights and activations through distribution standardization, demonstrating practical hardware benefits with FPGA implementation.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs demonstrate significant value in multimedia applications but are vulnerable to unavoidable weight perturbations that cause substantial performance degradation in signal reconstruction.

Method: Formulate robustness problem by minimizing difference between loss with and without weight perturbations, and derive novel robust loss function to regulate gradient of reconstruction loss with respect to weights.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple modalities show up to 7.5dB improvement in PSNR values compared to original INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed robust loss function effectively enhances INR robustness against weight perturbations, making them more suitable for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

*Liangyu Fu,Xuecheng Wu,Danlei Huang,Xinyi Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAMNet - a novel micro-expression recognition method combining 2D and 3D CNNs with multi-task learning and hierarchical attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to short duration and low intensity. Current methods struggle with extracting fine-grained spatiotemporal features effectively.

Method: Proposes FAMNet with 2D CNN AMNet2D and 3D CNN AMNet3D using ResNet18 backbone and attention modules. Uses multi-task learning with MER and facial action unit detection, parameter hard sharing, and different data loading methods for 2D/3D networks.

Result: Achieves 83.75% UAR and 84.03% UF1 on SAMM, CASME II, MMEW datasets. On challenging CAS(ME)^3 dataset: 51% UAR and 43.42% UF1, showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed FAMNet effectively extracts omni-directional features through 2D-3D CNN fusion and multi-task learning, demonstrating superior micro-expression recognition capabilities across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

TL;DR: CORENet is a cross-modal denoising framework that uses LiDAR supervision to clean noisy 4D radar data for improved object detection, maintaining radar-only operation during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D radar provides robustness in adverse weather but suffers from sparse and noisy point clouds that challenge effective perception. Existing methods struggle with the high noise levels in raw radar data.

Method: Proposes CORENet - a plug-and-play cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR data during training to identify noise patterns and extract discriminative features from 4D radar point clouds. Works with existing voxel-based detection pipelines without modification.

Result: Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset shows CORENet effectively enhances detection robustness and achieves superior performance compared to existing mainstream approaches.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses 4D radar noise limitations through LiDAR-supervised denoising while maintaining radar-only inference, making it practical for real-world deployment in adverse weather conditions.

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) for multi-view clustering that enhances feature discriminability and cluster compactness through instance learning, feature/cluster decoupling, and consistency learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-view clustering performance by learning both consistency and complementarity between views while addressing the overlooked aspect of cluster-oriented representation learning.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Multi-view instance learning with autoencoder reconstruction and contrastive learning, 2) Bi-level decoupling of features and clusters, 3) Consistency learning treating different views and neighbors as positive pairs.

Result: Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BDCL effectively enhances inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness, showing significant improvements in multi-view clustering performance.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

*Tianyi Xu,Fan Zhang,Boxin Shi,Tianfan Xue,Yujin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptiveAE is a reinforcement learning method that optimizes shutter speed and ISO selection for HDR imaging, addressing motion blur and noise issues in dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HDR techniques overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO, and fail to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes, leading to suboptimal image quality.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to optimize shutter speed and ISO combinations, integrates motion blur and noise simulation in training, leverages semantic information and exposure histograms, and adapts to user-defined exposure time budgets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, finding better exposure schedules than traditional solutions.

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE effectively addresses the limitations of conventional HDR methods by intelligently optimizing exposure parameters for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

*Seungheon Baek,Jinhyuk Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transfer learning approach extends pose-based shot recognition from singles to doubles badminton using contrastive learning and custom tracking to handle multi-player challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Doubles matches are more prevalent in international tournaments than singles, but previous research focused mainly on singles due to data availability and multi-person tracking challenges.

Method: Extracted keypoints from singles dataset using ViT-Pose, embedded through contrastive learning with ST-GCN, incorporated custom multi-object tracking algorithm to resolve ID switching, and used Transformer-based classifier for shot recognition.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, establishing foundation for doubles-specific datasets.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges the gap in doubles badminton analytics and provides a framework for future research on this predominant yet understudied format.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ is a novel image tokenizer that uses 2D Gaussians to better capture geometric structures in images, outperforming traditional quantization methods like VQ-GAN on reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers like VQ-GAN focus primarily on appearance features (texture, color) but neglect geometric structures due to their patch-based design, limiting their ability to encode rich visual information.

Method: Proposes Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ) that encodes image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, directly modeling structure-related parameters like position, rotation, and scale to capture geometric and spatial structures.

Result: VGQ achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with rFID score of 0.556 and PSNR of 24.93 on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming existing methods. Higher density of 2D Gaussians further improves reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: VGQ provides a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness, demonstrating that explicit structural modeling through 2D Gaussians significantly enhances image tokenization performance compared to traditional quantization approaches.

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometric shapes of foundation model features show remarkable transferability across domains, enabling distribution calibration for federated learning and long-tailed recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between observed training samples and true distribution caused by sampling bias and noise, leveraging transferable geometric properties of foundation model features.

Method: Uses off-the-shelf vision foundation models (CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, then applies geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration. For federated learning: acquires global geometric shape under privacy constraints to generate new samples. For long-tailed learning: transfers geometric knowledge from sample-rich to sample-scarce categories.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show effective overcoming of information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Geometric properties of foundation model features provide valuable transferable knowledge that can bridge distribution gaps in challenging learning scenarios like federated learning and long-tailed recognition.

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

TL;DR: Traditional deep learning models outperform vision-language models on facial emotion recognition tasks using low-quality grayscale images, with EfficientNet-B0 achieving 86.44% accuracy compared to CLIP's 64.07% and Phi-3.5 Vision's 51.66%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial Emotion Recognition is important for human-computer interaction and mental health applications, but there's a lack of empirical comparison between modern VLMs and traditional models on challenging low-quality FER datasets.

Method: Comparative evaluation of VLMs (Phi-3.5 Vision, CLIP) vs traditional models (VGG19, ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0) on FER-2013 dataset using a novel pipeline with GFPGAN image restoration and comprehensive performance metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and computational cost analysis.

Result: Traditional models significantly outperform VLMs - EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%), ResNet-50 (85.72%) vs CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%). VLMs show limitations in handling low-quality visual data despite their general capabilities.

Conclusion: VLMs require adaptation for noisy environments like low-resolution FER tasks. The study provides a reproducible benchmark and highlights that specialized traditional models currently outperform general-purpose VLMs on challenging emotion recognition tasks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

TL;DR: EAvatar: A 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction that uses sparse expression control and 3D priors to improve facial expression accuracy and texture continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity in highly deformable regions of head avatars.

Method: Proposes expression-aware and deformation-aware framework with sparse expression control mechanism using key Gaussians to influence neighboring deformations, plus leveraging 3D priors from pretrained generative models for facial geometry guidance.

Result: Produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EAvatar effectively addresses limitations in current 3DGS-based head avatar reconstruction by combining sparse expression control with 3D priors, achieving superior performance in capturing fine facial details and deformations.

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR introduces frequency- and locality-aware implicit neural representations with RC-GAUSS activation and wavelet-energy-guided encoding to address spectral bias and improve signal representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit neural representations lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to spectral bias and difficulty capturing high-frequency details.

Method: Proposes FLAIR with two innovations: 1) RC-GAUSS activation for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under time-frequency uncertainty principle, 2) Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding using discrete wavelet transform to guide frequency information.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: FLAIR effectively addresses the limitations of traditional INRs by incorporating frequency awareness and spatial localization, leading to improved performance across multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: Current foveated rendering requires expensive hardware eye tracking, limiting adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility issues.

Method: Combines Spherical Vision Transformer for 360° scene processing with LSTM temporal encoder for gaze patterns, using multi-modal fusion to predict future gaze locations with confidence estimates.

Result: Achieves 3.83° median angular error (24% better than saliency baselines), maintains consistent performance across regions/scene types, with reliable confidence calibration and statistical significance.

Conclusion: Software-only gaze prediction enables practical foveated rendering deployment without additional hardware, making performance improvements accessible across VR platforms.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

TL;DR: Lightweight GFVC framework with dual-mode optimization achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving while maintaining superior performance compared to VVC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFVC's practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters and high computational costs, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained environments like mobile edge devices.

Method: Dual-mode optimization combining architectural redesign (replacing 3x3 convolutions with slimmer layers) and operational refinement (two-stage adaptive channel pruning with soft pruning during training and hard pruning post-training).

Result: Achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving compared to baseline while outperforming VVC in perceptual-level quality metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight framework enables efficient GFVC deployment in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing complexity while preserving reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Motivation: SNNs underperform CNNs due to limited spike-based information capacity, and existing training methods with non-spiking inputs deviate from neuromorphic computing principles.

Method: Proposed a biologically inspired Neuron-like Encoding method that generates spike data based on biological neuron operations, enhanced with artificial photoreceptor layer to include color and luminance information.

Result: Experimental results using Integrate-and-Fire neuron model show increased information content in spike signals and improved SNN performance while adhering to neuromorphic principles.

Conclusion: This approach has strong potential for overcoming current SNN limitations and facilitating broader neuromorphic computing applications while maintaining biological fidelity.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

### [69] [DictAS: A Framework for Class-Generalizable Few-Shot Anomaly Segmentation via Dictionary Lookup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13560)
*Zhen Qu,Xian Tao,Xinyi Gong,ShiChen Qu,Xiaopei Zhang,Xingang Wang,Fei Shen,Zhengtao Zhang,Mukesh Prasad,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DictAS is a novel framework for few-shot anomaly segmentation that uses dictionary lookup capabilities instead of memorizing patterns, enabling cross-category generalization without retraining on target data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models depend on prior knowledge of real anomaly samples from seen classes, limiting their generalization to unseen object categories in few-shot anomaly segmentation.

Method: DictAS consists of three components: Dictionary Construction using normal reference images, Dictionary Lookup with sparse retrieval strategy to identify anomalies, and Query Discrimination Regularization with Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint to enhance anomaly discrimination.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets show that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot anomaly segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DictAS framework successfully transfers dictionary lookup capabilities to anomaly segmentation, enabling effective detection in unseen object categories without retraining, demonstrating superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

*Yuchen Yang,Linfeng Dong,Wei Wang,Zhihang Zhong,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify replaces SMPLify's iterative optimization with a neural network for 200x faster 3D human pose estimation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify's high computational cost limits practicality, while recent advances show neural networks can achieve similar accuracy with much faster runtime.

Method: Neural framework using single-pass regression instead of iterative fitting, with temporal sampling for data construction, human-centric normalization, and residual learning for generalization.

Result: Achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen datasets (3DPW, RICH), and works as model-agnostic plug-in tool.

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify establishes a practical and simple baseline for fast 3D human pose estimation with good generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a generative attention-based model for video action analysis that learns feature semantics by leveraging foreground-background differences, improving precision for IoT applications like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video action analysis methods overlook feature semantics and focus on action proposal optimization, making them unsuitable for high-performance IoT applications that require robust and scalable solutions.

Method: A novel generative attention-based model that simultaneously learns frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature semantics by leveraging differences between actions' foreground and background.

Result: Extensive experiments on action recognition and action detection benchmarks show superior performance, with comprehensive validation on widely recognized datasets demonstrating the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively utilizes feature semantics in feature extraction and shows strong performance across multiple video action analysis tasks, making it suitable for high-performance IoT applications.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel RVOS model that improves segmentation head design, integrates diffusion features without noise prediction, and uses TCMR module to enhance segmentation quality, achieving SOTA results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RVOS approaches focus too much on feature extraction and temporal modeling while neglecting segmentation head design, leaving room for improvement in boundary segmentation capability.

Method: Proposes Temporal-Conditional RVOS model that integrates existing segmentation methods, leverages text-to-video diffusion for features (without noise prediction module), and adds Temporal Context Mask Refinement module to overcome VAE limitations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public RVOS benchmarks with improved segmentation quality and simplified model architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses segmentation head design limitations in RVOS, demonstrating that careful integration of diffusion features and refinement modules can significantly boost performance without complex designs.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Proposed domain adaptation pipeline transforms clear-weather images into adverse condition images (fog, rain, snow, nighttime) using hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches to improve autonomous driving perception without costly real data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems perform poorly in adverse weather conditions due to underrepresentation in training datasets, and collecting/annotating real adverse weather data is prohibitively expensive.

Method: Developed novel data-generation pipelines including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches. Extended existing DA GAN to support auxiliary inputs and created training recipe using both simulated and real images. Introduced method to mitigate hallucinations in Stable-Diffusion outputs by adaptive blending.

Result: Achieved 1.85% overall improvement in semantic segmentation and 4.62% improvement specifically on nighttime conditions when evaluated on ACDC dataset.

Conclusion: Hybrid diffusion-GAN method effectively synthesizes photorealistic adverse weather images from clear images, enabling robust autonomous driving perception under challenging conditions without expensive real data collection.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe is a token-merging strategy for State Space Models in vision that uses state transition parameters to measure token importance and preserves sequential information flow, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs across image, video, and audio domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving computational efficiency of State Space Models (SSMs) in computer vision while maintaining their unique sequential modeling capabilities, as existing token reduction methods don't adequately address SSMs' sequential properties.

Method: Proposes MaMe token-merging strategy that leverages state transition parameter Δ as an informativeness measure for tokens and introduces strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow in SSM-based vision models.

Result: Achieves superior efficiency-performance trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models, maintains robustness under aggressive token reduction where existing methods degrade significantly, and shows strong generalization across video and audio domains.

Conclusion: MaMe establishes an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in diverse SSM applications while preserving the sequential modeling capabilities that make SSMs powerful architectures in computer vision.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationSSC is a novel 3D semantic scene completion framework that uses dual decoupling at source and pathway levels to separate semantic and geometric processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based 3D semantic scene completion methods use coupled encoders that force trade-offs between conflicting semantic and geometric demands, limiting overall performance.

Method: Proposes dual decoupling: 1) source-level decoupling using a foundation encoder for semantic features and stereo cost volumes, 2) pathway-level decoupling with specialized branches, hybrid view transformation, and Axis-Aware Fusion module for anisotropic feature merging.

Result: Achieves +0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU improvements on SemanticKITTI, and state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360 with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61 IoU.

Conclusion: The dual-decoupling design effectively addresses the conflict between semantic and geometric processing in 3D scene completion, demonstrating superior performance through disentangled feature processing and specialized fusion techniques.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content

thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local

LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA talking head synthesis models lack generalization across diverse human demographics (ethnicity, language, age) due to limitations in training data scale, quality, and diversity.

Method: Created TalkVid dataset through multi-stage automated pipeline filtering for motion stability, aesthetic quality, and facial detail, validated with human judgments. Built TalkVid-Bench evaluation set with 500 clips balanced across demographic and linguistic axes.

Result: Models trained on TalkVid outperform counterparts on previous datasets with superior cross-dataset generalization. Analysis reveals performance disparities across subgroups that aggregate metrics obscure.

Conclusion: TalkVid addresses critical data limitations in talking head synthesis, enabling better generalization and revealing the necessity of stratified evaluation for fair and comprehensive model assessment.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

TL;DR: A novel RGB-only category-level object pose estimation method using transformer-based network with geometric feature prediction and RANSAC-PnP for accurate pose estimation without depth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-D methods struggle in scenes lacking depth information, creating a need for reliable pose estimation using only RGB images in real-world scenarios.

Method: Transformer-based neural network predicts and fuses geometric features, enhanced by geometric feature-guided algorithm, with RANSAC-PnP for pose computation to handle variable object scales.

Result: Highly efficient and achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using only RGB images, demonstrating strong performance without depth data requirements.

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

### [81] [RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)
*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with image rotation detection, particularly distinguishing between 90° and 270° rotations, despite being able to identify 0° and some 180° rotations. Auxiliary information and prompting provide minimal improvements, revealing significant gaps in spatial reasoning compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models' visual reasoning capabilities in detecting image orientation and spatial relationships across different rotations.

Method: Created RotBench - a 350-image benchmark with lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Tested state-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro) on rotation identification (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Used auxiliary information (captions, depth maps), chain-of-thought prompting, simultaneous multi-orientation presentation, voting setups, and fine-tuning experiments.

Result: Most models reliably identify 0° images, some identify 180° images, but none can reliably distinguish between 90° and 270° rotations. Auxiliary information and prompting offered only small improvements. Fine-tuning improved 180° identification but not 90°/270° distinction.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in rotation identification, highlighting fundamental limitations in current multimodal models' visual reasoning.

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

*Ao Chen,Lihe Ding,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffIER addresses training-inference gap in diffusion models by iterative error minimization during inference, improving conditional generation quality across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in diffusion models suffers from sensitivity to guidance weight selection due to a training-inference gap that undermines conditional generation performance.

Method: Proposes DiffIER - an optimization-based method that performs iterative error minimization at each inference step to reduce accumulated error and bridge the training-inference gap.

Result: Outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks and achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play optimization framework effectively reduces accumulated error during inference, enhancing generation quality and demonstrating versatility across multiple applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

*Yutong Feng,Linlin Zhang,Hengyuan Cao,Yiming Chen,Xiaoduan Feng,Jian Cao,Yuxiong Wu,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniTry is a unified virtual try-on framework that extends beyond clothes to any wearable objects like jewelry and accessories, using a two-stage pipeline with mask-free localization and appearance transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON works focus mainly on clothes, but practical applications require trying on various wearable objects. Data curation for paired images is challenging when extending to diverse object types.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use unpaired images to train mask-free localization by repurposing inpainting models to draw objects in suitable positions, 2) Fine-tune with few paired images for object appearance consistency transfer.

Result: OmniTry outperforms existing methods on both object localization and ID-preservation across 12 classes of wearable objects, with quick convergence even with few paired samples.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends VTON to any wearable objects with mask-free setting, showing practical applicability and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

*Dengxian Gong,Shunping Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeH4R is a hybrid model for road network extraction that combines graph-generating efficiency with graph-growing dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for road network extraction face challenges: segmentation-based approaches struggle with topology fidelity after vectorization, graph-growing methods are computationally expensive due to iterative ROI cropping, and graph-generating methods limit dynamic vertex insertion.

Method: DeH4R decouples the task into four components: candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion. This hybrid approach enables dynamic vertex/edge insertions while maintaining fast inference speed.

Result: DeH4R outperforms prior SOTA method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale benchmark, while being approximately 10x faster. It also demonstrates strong performance on SpaceNet benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid architecture successfully combines the efficiency of graph-generating methods with the dynamic capabilities of graph-growing approaches, achieving superior topology fidelity, spatial consistency, and inference speed for road network extraction from remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumanPCR is a comprehensive evaluation suite for multimodal models that assesses human-centric visual understanding across three hierarchical levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning, revealing significant challenges in current models' abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress in multimodal models demands human-comparable performance across diverse environments, particularly in understanding human-related visual contexts, which existing benchmarks often overlook.

Method: The authors created HumanPCR with over 6,000 human-verified multiple choice questions across 9 dimensions for Perception and Comprehension levels, plus a manually curated video reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences and proactive context extraction.

Result: Evaluations on over 30 state-of-the-art models show significant challenges in human-centric visual understanding, especially in detailed space perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Models struggle with extracting proactive visual evidence and rely too heavily on query-guided retrieval.

Conclusion: Current multimodal models face substantial limitations in human-centric visual understanding, and even advanced techniques provide only limited benefits. HumanPCR provides a valuable benchmark for advancing development and evaluation of human-centric multimodal applications.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

*Shumeng Li,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Luping Zhou,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCMamba is a novel semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that leverages Mamba state space models and enhances diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives to achieve superior performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring high-quality annotated medical image data is costly and time-consuming. Semi-supervised approaches can reduce this burden by utilizing unlabeled data, and recent state space models like Mamba show promise for handling long-range dependencies in medical images.

Method: Proposes Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba (DCMamba) with three key components: 1) patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation leveraging Mamba's scanning characteristics, 2) diverse-scan collaboration module utilizing prediction discrepancies from different scanning directions, and 3) uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning for feature representation diversity.

Result: DCMamba significantly outperforms other semi-supervised methods, achieving a 6.69% improvement over the latest SSM-based method on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates that combining Mamba's efficient long-range dependency handling with diversity enhancement strategies from multiple perspectives leads to state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

TL;DR: New dataset of 457 agricultural virtual museums with text descriptions and hierarchical vision-language model for Metaverse content retrieval, achieving 62% R@1 and 78% MRR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizing educational content in Metaverse for easier learning, but current datasets are too small and searching for relevant scenarios is challenging.

Method: Created AgriMuseums dataset with 457 agricultural virtual museums, and proposed hierarchical vision-language model for natural language query-based retrieval.

Result: Achieved 62% R@1 and 78% MRR, with 6% R@1 and 11% MRR improvements on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses Metaverse content retrieval challenges and provides valuable dataset and model for agricultural education.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

### [88] [Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739)
*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPGA is a novel targeted adversarial attack method that targets the intermediate projector module (Q-Former) in Vision-Language Models, enabling fine-grained manipulations by operating on visual tokens rather than global embeddings, with improved effectiveness and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack methods collapse rich visual semantics into single global vectors, limiting attack granularity and failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline by overlooking the critical projector module.

Method: Proposes Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA) that attacks the Q-Former stage to transform global embeddings into fine-grained visual features, and Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content for precise manipulations.

Result: Extensive experiments show IPGA consistently outperforms existing methods in both global image captioning and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box settings, and successfully transfers to commercial VLMs like Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.

Conclusion: IPGA demonstrates that attacking the intermediate projector module enables more precise and effective adversarial manipulations in VLMs, addressing limitations of previous global embedding-based approaches.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage in LVLMs by sequentially masking images with noise and aggregating logits to improve multi-image reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models show degraded performance on multi-image tasks due to visual cue entanglement across different images, a phenomenon called cross-image information leakage.

Method: FOCUS sequentially masks all but one image with random noise during inference, obtains logits for each single clean image, aggregates them, and contrastively refines using noise-only reference to suppress leakage.

Result: FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families without additional training or architectural changes.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning in LVLMs by effectively mitigating cross-image information leakage during inference.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D is a new dataset for 6D pose estimation specifically designed for mobile robotics in industrial environments, addressing limitations of existing household-focused datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets focus on small household objects for robot arms, but mobile robots face different challenges like long-range perception, large objects, heavy occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives that current datasets don't address.

Method: The authors created MR6D dataset with 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions, capturing mobile platform-specific challenges including distant viewpoints, varied configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion patterns.

Result: Initial experiments show current 6D pose estimation pipelines underperform in these mobile robotics settings, with 2D segmentation being an additional challenge.

Conclusion: MR6D provides a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to mobile robotics demands, addressing the gap in existing datasets that overlook industrial environment challenges.

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method for non-rigid 3D shape registration to 2D keypoints using multiple cameras via generalized camera model, with three approaches: direction vectors from known/unknown 3D points, and silhouette-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Shape-from-Template (SfT) from single images to multiple cameras to improve 3D shape registration accuracy for medical imaging and hand-held camera applications by leveraging mutual constraints between multiple views.

Method: Three approaches using generalized camera model: 1) keypoints on direction vectors from known 3D points, 2) keypoints on direction vectors from unknown 3D points with known orientation, 3) silhouette-based iterative refinement. Correspondence-based methods use convex programming.

Result: Demonstrated accurate 3D shape registration on both synthetic and real data, showing improved reconstruction accuracy by utilizing multiple camera constraints.

Conclusion: First complete solution set for SfT with generalized cameras, enabling robust non-rigid 3D shape registration from multiple camera views with practical applications in medical imaging and hand-held camera scenarios.

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw is a bilevel optimization framework that uses LLMs as physics experts to generate interpretable constitutive laws from visual observations, enabling better generalization and physically plausible simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inferring intrinsic dynamics from visual observations either rely on manually defined constitutive priors (limiting generalization) or use neural networks (lacking interpretability and generalization).

Method: A bilevel optimization framework with: 1) Upper level: LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution where LLMs generate and revise constitutive laws with reduced search complexity, 2) Lower level: Vision-guided constitutive evaluation using visual simulation to assess consistency with underlying dynamics.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively infers interpretable intrinsic dynamics, and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel scenarios.

Conclusion: VisionLaw successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by combining LLMs' knowledge with visual simulation to produce interpretable and generalizable constitutive laws for physical behavior modeling.

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Conclusion: Med-CTX sets a new standard for trustworthy multimodal medical architecture by successfully integrating clinical reports with imaging data, providing both superior segmentation performance and clinically meaningful explanations for breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated

in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCA framework reduces attack latency on SNNs by up to 57% using timestep-level backpropagation and adversarial membrane potential reuse, maintaining comparable attack success rates to SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gradient-based adversarial attacks on SNNs suffer from high latency due to multi-timestep processing, making them impractical for real-time applications as they fail to exploit SNN-specific properties.

Method: Proposes TCA framework with two components: 1) Timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) for per-timestep evaluation and early stopping, and 2) Adversarial membrane potential reuse (A-MPR) to pre-calculate and reuse warm-up phase membrane potential accumulation.

Result: Experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show TCA reduces attack latency by up to 56.6% (white-box) and 57.1% (black-box) compared to SOTA methods while maintaining comparable attack success rates.

Conclusion: TCA successfully addresses the latency inefficiency of existing SNN attacks by leveraging SNN-specific properties, making adversarial attacks more feasible for real-time applications without compromising effectiveness.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates

regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable

TL;DR: SA3 is a cross-domain object detection method that uses attention-based alignment and instance-to-image level alignment to bridge domain gaps between source and target domains in intelligent transportation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain detection in intelligent transportation faces challenges due to domain gaps between source and target domains, requiring effective alignment mechanisms to maintain detection performance.

Method: Proposes Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3) with attention-based alignment module trained on both domains, channel importance re-weighting, and instance-to-image level alignment specific to target domain.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-domain object detection benchmarks show SA3 achieves superior results compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SA3 effectively addresses cross-domain detection challenges through adaptive alignment mechanisms, demonstrating significant performance improvements in intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but often fail to precisely align with text prompts, leading to missing critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts.

Method: Proposes a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on target prompts, explicitly modeling signal components during denoising to provide fine-grained control. The framework is training-free and integrates with diffusion and flow matching architectures, supporting additional conditioning like bounding boxes for spatial alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image generation fidelity and prompt alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses prompt alignment issues in text-to-image generation, offering improved fidelity without requiring additional training, and supports enhanced spatial control through additional conditioning modalities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments

TL;DR: AI multi-agent system for automated stone deterioration pattern identification that outperforms traditional expert-based methods and foundational models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stone deterioration identification methods using expert teams are accurate but time-consuming and resource-intensive, creating need for automated AI solutions

Method: Multi-agent AI system with 5 specialized agents (lithologist, pathologist, environmental expert, conservator-restorer, diagnostic coordinator) using cognitive architecture to simulate expert collaboration

Result: System tested on 28 difficult images with multiple deterioration patterns showed significant improvement in all metrics compared to foundational model

Conclusion: The multi-agent AI approach effectively automates stone pathology diagnosis and demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods and baseline AI models

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two realistic incremental object detection benchmarks (RICO) introduced to address limitations of synthetic evaluations, showing current IL methods underperform compared to simple replay and individual training approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current incremental learning evaluations rely on synthetic benchmarks that obscure real-world performance, lacking realistic domain shifts and class expansions.

Method: Created two benchmarks: Domain RICO (fixed classes with domain shifts) and Expanding-Classes RICO (new domains and classes per step), built from 14 diverse datasets covering various real-world conditions.

Result: All IL methods underperformed in both adaptability and retention; replaying small amounts of previous data outperformed all methods, but individual training remained superior.

Conclusion: The performance gap is attributed to weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to handle diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity, highlighting the need for better IL approaches.

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCRReg is a novel regularization method that uses Latent Concept Representations to guide medical imaging models toward clinically meaningful features instead of spurious correlations, improving robustness without requiring concept labels in the main training set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often rely on spurious correlations rather than clinically meaningful features, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts.

Method: Uses a small auxiliary dataset to synthesize concept examples, extracts Latent Concept Representations (LCRs) for predefined relevant features, and incorporates a regularization term that guides CNNs to activate within latent subspaces associated with those concepts.

Result: Significantly improves robustness to spurious correlations in controlled experiments and enhances performance on diabetic retinopathy classification under both synthetic perturbations and out-of-distribution generalization, outperforming baselines like multitask learning and concept-based models.

Conclusion: LCRReg provides a lightweight, architecture-agnostic strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept supervision, making it practical for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

*Taimur Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a ConvLSTM neural network to forecast South Asian smog events using Sentinel-5P aerosol data, achieving good predictive performance for 5-day aerosol index forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: South Asian smog events cause severe air pollution with significant socio-economic impacts, but real-time forecasting systems for particulate matter concentrations are lacking at regional scale.

Method: Used Sentinel-5P air constituent data (2019-2023) with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network to capture spatial and temporal correlations, using UV Aerosol Index at 340-380 nm as predictor.

Result: Achieved Aerosol Index forecasting at five-day intervals with Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of ~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74.

Conclusion: The ConvLSTM model effectively forecasts aerosol events but can be improved by integrating additional data and refining architecture.

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

TL;DR: Proposes SCRNet with novel Feature Aggregation Module and Spatial-Channel Regulation Module to address limitations of CNN and Transformer methods in medical ultrasound segmentation by combining convolution and cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN methods ignore long-range dependencies while Transformer methods overlook local contextual information in medical ultrasound image segmentation, creating a need for a hybrid approach.

Method: Developed Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) with Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to process dual input features, integrated with Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM) within UNet encoder architecture.

Result: SCRNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SCRNet framework effectively combines convolution operations and cross-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture both long-range dependencies and local contextual information for superior medical ultrasound segmentation.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysGM is a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts 3D Gaussian representation and physical properties from a single image, enabling fast 4D rendering and physical simulation without requiring pre-reconstructed 3DGS or unstable optimization-heavy guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis methods rely on pre-reconstructed 3DGS representations and face limitations with inflexible physical attributes or unstable optimization-heavy guidance from video models.

Method: Joint optimization for Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction, refined with physically plausible reference videos using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to avoid complex SDS optimization. Trained on PhysAssets dataset of 24,000+ 3D assets with physical annotations.

Result: Generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute, achieving significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering results.

Conclusion: PhysGM overcomes critical limitations of existing methods by providing a feed-forward framework for joint 3D representation and physics prediction, enabling efficient and realistic physical simulations from single images.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single illumination degradation types and lack unified handling of diverse lighting conditions like low-light and backlit scenarios, which commonly degrade image quality in real-world environments.

Method: Proposes DIME-Net with Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator using sparse gating to adaptively select S-curve expert networks based on input characteristics, integrated with Retinex theory. Includes damage restoration module with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. Uses MixBL hybrid dataset for training.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets without retraining, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: DIME-Net shows potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex illumination conditions, offering a unified solution for multiple illumination degradation types.

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FIQA methods mainly rely on CNNs, leaving the potential of Vision Transformer architectures underexplored for face image quality assessment tasks.

Method: Extends standard ViT backbones with a learnable quality token concatenated with image patch tokens. Uses global self-attention to aggregate contextual information, then branches into two heads: one for face representation learning and another for quality score regression.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance across both CNN- and ViT-based face recognition models.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures are highly effective for modeling face image utility, and ViTs represent a scalable foundation for future FIQA research.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future

Method: Created a large-scale dataset with 20K video frames using lightweight acquisition pipeline for broad scene coverage at low cost, featuring sparse but statistically sufficient ground truth annotations.

Result: Benchmark experiments show substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, validating the dataset's utility and establishing it as a new platform for depth estimation research.

Conclusion: The dataset presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density than existing datasets, creating new challenges for generalization and advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new

Motivation: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations that are challenging and expensive to obtain, while videos vary in difficulty and may not need the same annotation level.

Method: Proposes active learning strategy to estimate necessary annotation type per video, and novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach to generate pseudo-labels from various annotation types (tags, points, scribbles, boxes, masks).

Result: Validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets, significantly reducing annotation costs while maintaining minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses annotation cost challenges in video action detection by adaptively selecting appropriate annotation types and generating pseudo-labels for efficient training.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need longer perception ranges (250m+) for safe highway driving at high speeds and to handle large trucks with high inertia, but existing BEV approaches have quadratic cost increases with distance.

Method: Built on sparse representation with efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal temporal features, plus novel self-supervised pre-training scheme using unlabeled camera-LiDAR data.

Result: Achieves 250m perception range with 26.6% mAP improvement in object detection and 30.5% reduction in Chamfer Distance for LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully overcomes range limitations of existing perception systems, enabling safe long-distance highway autonomy for both passenger vehicles and large trucks.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

*Byeonggwon Lee,Junkyu Park,Khang Truong Giang,Soohwan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for online 3D Gaussian Splatting that improves scene completeness through adaptive view selection of both keyframes and optimal non-keyframes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely solely on keyframes which are insufficient for complete scene reconstruction, and online processing constraints limit the use of many frames or extensive training iterations.

Method: Uses adaptive view selection by analyzing reconstruction quality online to choose optimal non-keyframes for additional training, combined with an online multi-view stereo approach to ensure 3D consistency throughout the modeling process.

Result: The method significantly enhances model completeness and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance particularly in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the limitations of keyframe-only methods by intelligently selecting additional viewpoints, resulting in more complete and high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting models from RGB-only frames.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

*Tuo Chen,Jie Gui,Minjing Dong,Ju Jia,Lanting Fang,Jian Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noisy Alignment (NA) is a data poisoning backdoor attack method for self-supervised contrastive learning that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images by strategically manipulating random cropping to achieve state-of-the-art attack performance while maintaining clean-data accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data poisoning backdoor attacks for contrastive learning suffer from limited efficacy due to dependence on fragile implicit co-occurrence between backdoor and target objects and inadequate suppression of discriminative features in backdoored images.

Method: The method implements noisy alignment by strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism, formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with theoretically derived optimal parameters to suppress noise components in poisoned images.

Result: Noisy Alignment achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs, maintains clean-data accuracy, and demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: The proposed Noisy Alignment method provides an effective and robust data poisoning backdoor attack for contrastive learning by explicitly addressing noise suppression through strategic manipulation of the training process.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video dubbing only edits mouth regions, causing discordant facial expressions and body gestures that break viewer immersion. Need holistic full-body motion synchronization.

Method: InfiniteTalk - streaming audio-driven generator for infinite-length dubbing. Uses temporal context frames for seamless transitions and optimized sampling strategy with fine-grained reference frame positioning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets. Superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization confirmed by quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: Sparse-frame video dubbing with strategic keyframe preservation enables effective holistic motion editing while maintaining identity and motion coherence, overcoming limitations of naive image-to-video models.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Motivation: Modern 3D generation methods create shapes quickly but lack geometric detail due to computational constraints, requiring a specialized approach to enhance detail without the overhead of large-scale generative models.

Method: Uses data-dependent flows in latent space for coarse-to-fine transformation, implements token matching strategy for spatial correspondence during refinement, and designs training data to match characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes.

Result: Effectively enhances shapes from various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches (single-view to sparse multi-view inputs), achieving high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis with training efficiency.

Conclusion: DetailGen3D provides an efficient solution for adding high-quality geometric details to 3D shapes while maintaining computational efficiency and preserving global structure across different generation methods.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while

Motivation: 3DGS requires large numbers of 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity rendering, leading to substantial memory consumption and storage requirements that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes knowledge distillation with various teacher models (vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented, dropout-regularized) aggregated to guide lightweight student model. Introduces structural similarity loss to maintain geometric consistency between student and teacher.

Result: Achieves promising rendering results in both quality and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Distilled-3DGS is an effective framework that successfully reduces memory/storage requirements while maintaining rendering quality through knowledge distillation techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy to improve medical AI for lung cancer detection by incorporating physicians' background knowledge alongside lesion data, achieving 92% accuracy with 10% sensitivity improvement and reduced uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address diagnostic uncertainty in medical AI systems that limits physician trust and clinical adoption, as current AI lacks the extensive background knowledge and clinical experience that physicians use for accurate diagnosis.

Method: Developed Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy that learns physicians' background knowledge from lesion-free images alongside chest X-ray lesion information, using 2,517 lesion-free and 656 nodule images from Ajou University Hospital.

Result: Achieved 92% accuracy (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with 10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to baseline model, while decreasing entropy (measure of uncertainty) by 0.2.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses knowledge deficiency in medical AI by incorporating background knowledge, reducing diagnostic uncertainty and improving performance metrics, potentially increasing physician trust in AI-assisted diagnosis.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

TL;DR: First publicly available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation with MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients including ADEM cases, with comprehensive metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric demyelinating disorders beyond Multiple Sclerosis, despite both adults and children being affected by these conditions.

Method: Collected MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating disorders (including 3 ADEM cases) with lesion segmentation masks and extensive patient metadata. Evaluated a state-of-the-art lesion segmentation model trained on existing MS dataset to assess dataset quality.

Result: The dataset provides valuable pediatric demyelinating disorder cases beyond MS, and evaluation results demonstrate the importance of diverse datasets for accurate lesion segmentation.

Conclusion: This pediatric dataset fills a critical gap in publicly available resources for demyelinating disorder research and highlights the need for diverse datasets beyond adult MS cases to improve diagnostic and monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple
causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or
vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the
myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating
disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting
lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant
lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating
disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly
available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset
comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating
disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the
dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment,
personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of
the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art
lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results
underscore the importance of diverse datasets

Motivation: Cervical cancer causes high mortality in low/middle-income countries despite being treatable. VIA screening is affordable but subjective and requires trained professionals. AI automation can eliminate subjectivity and enable task shifting to less trained workers.

Method: Lightweight deep learning algorithm combining EfficientDet-Lite3 for ROI detection and MobileNet-V2 for classification, deployed on Android devices for remote operation without internet or sophisticated infrastructure.

Conclusion: The proposed system presents a promising automated low-resource screening approach that can operate without highly-trained professionals, labs, or internet connectivity.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and
claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being
relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening
programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates
significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection
with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for
low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the
test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is
subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would
allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with
AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In
our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes
EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2
based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an
android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant
results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs,
sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification
model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity
of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated
low-resource screening approach.

*Shuxin Liang,Yihan Xiao,Wenlu Tang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian Splatting approach that reconstructs internal scenes and volumetric structures from sparse sliced data without requiring camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods focus primarily on external surfaces, but many applications require understanding object interiors. This work addresses the need for reconstructing internal scenes and volumetric structures.

Method: Directly models continuous volumetric density through inner 3D Gaussian distribution. The approach is plug-and-play, camera-pose-free, and compatible with any data modalities.

Result: Effectively reconstructs smooth and detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Provides CUDA implementation for efficient processing.

Conclusion: The method successfully extends 3D Gaussian Splatting to internal scene reconstruction, offering a versatile solution for volumetric modeling that works with various data types without camera pose requirements.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient
scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D
Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external
surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which
is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's
interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the
inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and
detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates
the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with
any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at:

*Sedigheh Dargahi,Sylvain Bouix,Christian Desrosier*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning approach corrects MRI distortion using single acquisition instead of requiring paired blip-up/blip-down images like traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion MRI suffers from susceptibility-induced distortion artifacts, and traditional correction methods require paired acquisitions which limits applicability to retrospective single-direction data.

Method: Proposed a deep learning-based approach that corrects susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions.

Result: Experimental results show the method achieves performance comparable to traditional topup correction.

Conclusion: The approach serves as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility distortion correction in dMRI, particularly for single-acquisition datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and
connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However,
acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short
time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is
susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and
intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on
having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their
applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding
direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct
susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or
blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results
show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating
its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility
distortion correction in dMRI.

### [125] [Towards Understanding and Harnessing the Transferability of Prognostic Knowledge in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13482)
*Pei Liu,Luping Ji,Jiaxiang Gou,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents Path-PKT, the first systematic study on prognostic knowledge transfer between different cancers using whole-slide images, addressing limitations of cancer-specific models by enabling knowledge sharing across cancers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSI-based prognosis models are cancer-specific and cannot leverage prognostic knowledge from other cancers, limiting their ability to handle rare tumors with limited samples and benefit from generalizable knowledge across cancers.

Method: The study curates a large multi-cancer dataset (UNI2-h-DSS with 13 cancers), designs experiments to understand knowledge transfer factors, and proposes MoE-PKT - a mixture-of-experts approach with routing mechanism to utilize prognostic knowledge from other cancers.

Result: The research demonstrates computational evidence of prognostic knowledge transferability between different cancers and shows how source models can be effectively transferred to rare tumor diseases with limited samples.

Conclusion: This study establishes foundational principles for knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis, enabling more effective models that can leverage cross-cancer prognostic knowledge, particularly beneficial for rare cancers with limited data.

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of
cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a
conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer
disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the
prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years,
this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with
practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very
limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge
in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study
on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises
three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers
and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between
different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what
factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)
Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)
with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in
other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare
tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of
knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis. Source code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Systematic review of 46 abdominal CT datasets finds significant redundancy (59.1% case reuse) and geographic bias (75.3% from North America/Europe), with domain shift and selection bias as major concerns affecting AI model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the suitability of publicly available abdominal CT datasets for AI applications in clinical settings and identify biases that may limit model generalizability across diverse healthcare environments.

Method: Systematic review of 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets (50,256 studies) with bias assessment performed on 19 datasets containing >=100 cases, analyzing redundancy, geographic distribution, and specific bias categories.

Result: Found substantial redundancy (59.1% case reuse) and Western/geographic skew (75.3% from North America and Europe). Domain shift (63%) and selection bias (57%) were the most prevalent high-risk categories in larger datasets.

Conclusion: Proposes targeted strategies including multi-institutional collaboration, standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of diverse patient populations and imaging technologies to develop more equitable and clinically robust AI models for abdominal imaging.

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT
datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets
(50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy
(59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America
and Europe). A bias assessment was performed on the 19 datasets with >=100
cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain
shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model
generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in
resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted
strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional
collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of
diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial
in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models
for abdominal imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Zero-shot cell segmentation using foundation model with self-prompting mechanism and in-context learning, eliminating need for manual tuning or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cell segmentation methods require extensive manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive for high-throughput drug discovery screening.

Method: Three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular segmentation using segmentation foundation model in zero-shot setting with self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed foreground/background points.

Result: Accurately segments biologically relevant structures on both standard benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays without dataset-specific tuning.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective zero-shot solution for cell segmentation in high-throughput screening, eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning or model fine-tuning while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in
biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug
candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep
learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale
datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting
relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive
manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a
novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot
setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy.
Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular
segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological
and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed
foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell
segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays,
demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures
without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

*Tiago Assis,Ines P. Machado,Benjamin Zwick,Nuno C. Garcia,Reuben Dorent*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that uses biomechanical simulations to improve brain shift compensation in neurosurgery by refining sparse keypoint matches into physically plausible dense deformations, outperforming classical interpolation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain shift compensation is critical for neuronavigation reliability during neurosurgery. Current keypoint-based methods use simple geometric interpolators that ignore tissue biomechanics, leading to less accurate dense displacement fields.

Method: Generate large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations, then train a residual 3D U-Net to refine standard interpolation estimates into biomechanically guided deformations from sparse matched keypoints.

Result: Experiments on simulated displacement fields show the method significantly outperforms classical interpolators, reducing mean square error by half while adding negligible computational overhead at inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework successfully integrates biomechanical knowledge into keypoint-based registration, providing more accurate and physically plausible brain deformation estimates for neurosurgical navigation.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the
reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based
registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological
changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore
tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically
plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a
large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations.
Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates
into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of
simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error
while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time. Code

TL;DR: Diffusion models for synthetic DCE-MRI generation using pre-contrast images, with tumor-aware losses and segmentation conditioning to enhance lesion fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns, contraindications, cost, and workflow complexity associated with contrast agents in breast cancer DCE-MRI by generating synthetic contrast-enhanced images.

Method: Pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models with 22 variants, tumor-aware loss functions, and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning in single-breast and full breast settings.

Result: Subtraction image-based models outperformed post-contrast-based models across 5 evaluation metrics. Tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improved ROI evaluation. Reader study confirmed high realism with 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists.

Conclusion: Generative contrast-enhancement shows emerging clinical potential for synthetic DCE-MRI, reducing need for contrast agents while maintaining diagnostic quality.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety
concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this
end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic
models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of
22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings.
Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions
and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter
dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that
subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based
models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the
entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both
tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The
latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit
assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be
available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4
MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating
an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our

TL;DR: CaLID is a novel diffusion-based framework for 3D cardiac reconstruction from sparse 2D CMR slices that eliminates need for auxiliary inputs, improves accuracy, and speeds up processing 24x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D cardiac reconstruction methods from sparse 2D CMR slices face limitations including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes, computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic inputs like segmentation labels or motion data.

Method: Proposes Cardiac Latent Interpolation Diffusion (CaLID) framework with three innovations: 1) data-driven interpolation using diffusion models, 2) latent space operation for computational efficiency (24x speedup), 3) works with only sparse 2D CMR images without auxiliary inputs. Extended to handle 2D+T spatiotemporal data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance against baseline methods, superior reconstruction quality and efficiency in volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks. Maintains temporal coherence for spatiotemporal data.

Conclusion: CaLID advances spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for cardiovascular imaging by addressing fundamental limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing
and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the
sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric
information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential
for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges,
including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or
spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic
inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent
\textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces
three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme
based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships
between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a
computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds
up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational
overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as
input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,
eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus
simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the
effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.
Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate
that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By
addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework
advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart
reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for
cardiovascular imaging.

TL;DR: AI-powered real-time segmentation system for Circle of Willis using TCCD ultrasound to reduce operator dependency in cerebrovascular screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TCCD ultrasound is radiation-free, affordable and accessible for Circle of Willis assessment but heavily depends on operator expertise, limiting widespread adoption.

Method: Developed Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO) network for real-time brain vessel segmentation using prospectively collected TCCD data (738 frames, 3,419 artery instances).

Result: Achieved average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of 0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, mAP of 0.953 with 14.199 ms per-frame inference speed.

Conclusion: The system provides practical solution to reduce operator experience dependency in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with potential for clinical workflows and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the
brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is
important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical
management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler
(TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature,
affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend
heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and
performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To
address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW
auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No
prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD.
In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)
network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for
brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data
comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish
a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO
demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and
contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of
0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame
inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce
reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with
potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained
settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale
validation.

TL;DR: NeuSee is a computational imaging framework that uses neural networks and diffractive optics to protect camera sensors from laser damage while maintaining image quality across the full visible spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine vision systems are vulnerable to laser flare that can blind or permanently damage sensors through oversaturation. Existing protection methods are limited and don't handle full-spectrum visible light.

Method: Joint learning of a neural representation for a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. Adversarially trained end-to-end on 100K images to suppress laser irradiance up to 10^6 times sensor saturation threshold.

Result: Outperforms other learned DOEs with 10.1% improvement in restored image quality. Achieves full-spectrum imaging and laser suppression for the first time, handling dynamic laser conditions and environmental factors.

Conclusion: NeuSee provides effective sensor protection against high-intensity lasers while maintaining high-fidelity imaging across the entire visible spectrum, representing a significant advancement in computational imaging for machine vision safety.

Abstract: Machine vision systems are susceptible to laser flare, where unwanted intense
laser illumination blinds and distorts its perception of the environment
through oversaturation or permanent damage to sensor pixels. We introduce
NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor
protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural
representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space
Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained
end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high
as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point
at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system
leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing,
integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for
realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account
open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and
positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions,
and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum
imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in

TL;DR: MMIS-Net leverages multiple small medical image datasets across modalities, organs, and diseases to improve segmentation performance on unseen data through similarity fusion blocks and a unified label space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning methods use single-source data, missing the potential of combining numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various modalities, organs, and diseases to improve generalization on unseen data.

Method: Proposed MMIS-Net with Similarity Fusion blocks for supervision and pixel-wise similarity knowledge selection, plus a one-hot label space to handle inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions across datasets.

Result: Achieved best mean Dice score of 0.83 and absolute volume difference of 0.035 for fluids segmentation, and perfect AUC of 1 for fluid detection on RETOUCH challenge, outperforming foundation models and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The model's effectiveness stems from Similarity Fusion blocks for knowledge selection and the one-hot label space approach that addresses class inconsistencies across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the
segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most
methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ,
or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available
annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various
modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim
to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance
on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called
MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features
Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity
knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address
inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot
label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.
MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities
to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH
grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for
medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved
the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for
the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1
for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight
the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity
Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity
knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label
class inconsistencies and contradictions.

TL;DR: SSR-KD is an AI framework that reconstructs high-quality 3D bone models from biplanar X-rays in 30 seconds with <1.0mm error, eliminating need for CT scans and manual segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CT-based bone modeling has limitations including radiation exposure, time-consuming manual work, and inability for intraoperative use. There's a need for faster, safer alternatives.

Method: Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD) framework that uses biplanar X-rays instead of CT scans, combining semi-supervised learning with knowledge distillation techniques.

Result: Achieves reconstruction in 30 seconds with average error under 1.0mm. High tibial osteotomy simulations showed comparable clinical applicability to CT-based models.

Conclusion: The approach accelerates the process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and significantly improves practicality of bone models for orthopedic applications.

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and
preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical
structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models
are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation
exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce
Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and
accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar
X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the
dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy
simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating
that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical
applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the
process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and
significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative
applications in orthopedics.

TL;DR: UNICON enables medical foundation models to continually adapt to new domains, tasks, and modalities without catastrophic forgetting, achieving improved performance across multiple medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging faces data scarcity challenges for pre-training models for every domain/modality/task. Continual learning can help foundation models integrate new knowledge without requiring large datasets for each training phase.

Method: UNICON framework provides unified, perpetually expandable continual learning that allows foundation models to dynamically expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives through careful integration.

Result: Adapted chest CT foundation model showed improved performance for both prognosis and segmentation tasks. Continual incorporation of PET scans achieved 5% improvement in Dice score compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Foundation models are not inherently constrained to initial training scope and can evolve, paving the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging through continual learning approaches like UNICON.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general
trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes
pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual
learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different
domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring
large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied
CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that
enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,
and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes
in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.
Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically
expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives
without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate
our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for
classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved
performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually
incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to
respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not
inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving
the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

Motivation: Homelessness affects millions with social stigmatization being a major barrier to alleviation. Online discourse reflects public opinion and provides insights to identify social biases that influence policymaking.

Method: Created manually-annotated multi-modal dataset from Reddit, Twitter, news articles, and city council minutes. Evaluated LLMs (both local and closed-source) using zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques to automate bias detection.

Result: Local LLMs showed significant inconsistencies in zero-shot classification but their in-context learning scores approached closed-source LLM performance. LLMs outperformed BERT across all categories.

Conclusion: The work aims to raise awareness about bias against homeless people, develop policy indicators, and enhance fairness in Generative AI applications for social good.

Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide.
Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social
stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public
perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council
discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable
insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to
alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel
methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language
models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital
spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from
Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes
across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies
of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and
automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as
classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques
to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B
Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are
significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the
in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the
classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT
when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about
the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and
ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI
technologies.

### [137] [Prompt Orchestration Markup Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13948)
*Yuge Zhang,Nan Chen,Jiahang Xu,Yuqing Yang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: POML is a markup language that addresses LLM prompting challenges through structured components, data integration tags, CSS-like styling, and developer tooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM prompting practices lack comprehensive solutions for organizing complex prompts with diverse data types, managing presentation variations systematically, and providing adequate tooling support.

Method: POML uses component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples), specialized tags for data integration, CSS-like styling to separate content from presentation, templating for dynamic prompts, and includes a developer toolkit with IDE support and SDKs.

Result: Validated through case studies showing impact on complex application integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), plus user studies demonstrating effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

Conclusion: POML provides a comprehensive solution that addresses structural, data integration, formatting sensitivity, and tooling challenges in LLM prompting through a unified markup language approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current
practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity,
and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing
complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or
managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we
introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs
component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),
specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system
to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It
includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit
(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate
POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application
integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user
study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

*Chenhe Dong,Shaowei Yao,Pengkun Jiao,Jianhui Yang,Yiming Jin,Zerui Huang,Xiaojiang Zhou,Dan Ou,Haihong Tang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TaoSR1 framework enables direct deployment of LLMs for e-commerce relevance prediction using CoT reasoning, addressing error accumulation and hallucination through SFT, DPO, and GRPO optimization stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT models lack complex reasoning capabilities for query-product relevance, and existing LLM approaches either use discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models rather than deploying LLMs directly.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) SFT with CoT for reasoning, 2) Offline sampling with pass@N strategy and DPO for quality improvement, 3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling with GRPO to reduce hallucination, plus post-processing for efficient deployment.

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves substantial gains in online human evaluations.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification, enabling direct LLM deployment for e-commerce search tasks.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search.
BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning
capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use
discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We
propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key
challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative
hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves
three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative
probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment.
TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves
substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel
paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

### [139] [LLM-Enhanced Linear Autoencoders for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13500)
*Jaewan Moon,Seongmin Park,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: L3AE integrates LLMs into linear autoencoders for recommender systems, using a two-phase optimization with closed-form solutions to combine textual semantics and user-item interactions, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear autoencoders that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics from LLMs.

Method: Two-phase optimization: (i) constructs semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived representations, (ii) learns item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals with semantic correlations as regularization. Both phases use closed-form solutions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets with 27.6% gain in Recall@20 and 39.3% gain in NDCG@20.

Conclusion: L3AE successfully integrates LLMs into LAE framework, effectively combining textual semantics and user-item interactions through computationally efficient closed-form optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-MoE is a novel training system that enables scalable training of large Mixture-of-Experts models (up to 545B parameters) on non-NVIDIA hardware, addressing memory overhead and communication bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE training systems are optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and perform poorly on other platforms, while next-generation MoE architectures face scalability limitations due to activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.

Method: X-MoE uses efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks to optimize training performance.

Result: On AMD MI250X GPUs, X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs to 545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than existing methods under the same hardware budget while maintaining high training throughput.

Conclusion: X-MoE successfully addresses the scalability limitations of modern MoE architectures and enables efficient training on non-NVIDIA platforms, unlocking significant computational potential.

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

### [141] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Input Time Scaling paradigm complements existing scaling methods by focusing on query refinement during both training and testing, challenging the "garbage in, garbage out" assumption and showing that seemingly low-quality data can achieve high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling focuses on data/training scaling and inference-time reasoning, but neglects input refinement strategies during both training and testing phases.

Method: Proposes Input Time Scaling by combining meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies during both training and testing, requiring co-design approach.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on AIME24 (76.7%) and AIME25 (76.7%) with 32B models, and up to 86.7% on AIME24 with majority voting. Shows that less data with strategic input refinement outperforms more data.

Conclusion: Input refinement strategies during both training and testing are crucial, challenging conventional data quality assumptions and demonstrating that "less is more" when combined with proper input-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

TL;DR: BERT-VQA model for visual question answering on plots failed to outperform baseline, disproving hypothesis about VisualBERT's cross-modality effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle visual question answering on plots, requiring information exchange between vision and language domains.

Method: Developed BERT-VQA using VisualBERT-based architecture with pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, compared against LSTM+CNN+classifier baseline.

Result: Final outcome disproved the core hypothesis that VisualBERT's cross-modality module is essential for aligning plot components with question phrases.

Conclusion: Provided insights into plot question answering difficulty and appropriateness of different model architectures for this problem.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE is a two-stage framework that generates high-quality reasoning chains for VLMs through reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning, outperforming standard methods on complex image annotation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks like emotion classification and context-driven object detection. Standard fine-tuning methods ignore underlying rationales, and existing approaches produce inconsistent reasoning chains due to lack of verified training data.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) RISE-CoT uses reinforcement learning to generate visually grounded, logically consistent chains of thought by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations. 2) RISE-R1 filters high-quality CoTs for supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to achieve interpretable reasoning.

Result: RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT on both complex and simple image annotation tasks, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability.

Conclusion: RISE provides a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning capabilities without requiring manually annotated reasoning chains, offering significant improvements in complex visual task performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCAL classifier for hierarchical multi-label classification uses prototype contrastive learning, adaptive task-weighting, and prototype perturbation to maintain structural consistency and improve optimization balance in multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in hierarchical multi-label classification including maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in multi-task learning, particularly the "one-strong-many-weak" optimization bias.

Method: Proposes HCAL classifier with prototype contrastive learning for semantic consistency, adaptive task-weighting mechanism that dynamically allocates optimization resources, and prototype perturbation with controlled noise injection. Introduces Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) metric for evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed HCAL classifier effectively addresses structural consistency and optimization balance issues in hierarchical multi-label classification through integrated prototype learning and adaptive weighting mechanisms.

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an expert survey-based framework to evaluate biometric modalities, updating outdated 1998 standards with current technological realities and emerging vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing 1998 evaluation framework for biometric modalities is outdated and fails to capture recent technological developments and emerging vulnerabilities in authentication systems.

Method: Conducted an expert survey with 24 biometric specialists to evaluate biometric modalities, analyzed expert agreement levels, and compared assessments with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets.

Result: Found substantial shifts in property ratings - face recognition improved due to technological progress, while fingerprint reliability decreased due to emerging vulnerabilities. Strong alignment between expert assessments and empirical evidence was observed.

Conclusion: The study provides an updated evaluation framework that integrates expert insight with empirical evidence, identifies key open challenges through expert disagreements, and guides future research directions in biometric authentication.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic survey of log usage across database, data warehouse, web, and knowledge graph logs, analyzing over 300 publications to identify common characteristics, usage pipelines, and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital interactions leave valuable traces in logs, but research on log usage remains fragmented across domains with no comprehensive study consolidating existing efforts.

Method: Systematic survey analyzing more than 300 publications to address three central questions about common structural/functional characteristics, standard pipelines, and constraints/NFRs for log usage.

Result: Reveals limited end-to-end approaches, absence of standardization across log usage pipelines, and existence of shared structural elements among different log types.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive overview of log usage, identifies gaps, highlights opportunities for future research, particularly regarding exploitation and democratization of knowledge graph logs.

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More
than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do
different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?
(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and
non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey
reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of
standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared
structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing
knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey
provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log
usage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly
regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.

Motivation: To improve scene reconstruction performance by integrating multiple data sources (RGB, depth, semantics) and reducing training time while enhancing detail capture and noise discrimination.

Method: Uses SG-MLP sampling structure with PR-MLP for voxel pre-rendering, and progressive semantic modeling to extract semantic information at increasing precision levels.

Result: Achieves best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU metrics on seven synthetic scenes, with competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness.

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf demonstrates effective and practical scene reconstruction with improved performance metrics and reduced training time.

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: Sketch3DVE enables precise 3D-aware video editing using sketches to manipulate structural content in videos with significant viewpoint changes, addressing challenges of novel view consistency and sparse 2D inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing structural content in 3D scenes within videos remains challenging, especially with large camera rotations or zooms. Existing methods struggle with generating consistent novel views, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into realistic 3D video outputs.

Method: Uses image editing for first frame, propagates edits to remaining frames. Employs sketching for precise geometry control and mask-based editing. Utilizes dense stereo for point cloud and camera parameter estimation. Proposes point cloud editing with depth maps for 3D geometry alignment. Uses 3D-aware mask propagation and video diffusion model for seamless merging.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority in video editing, particularly for handling significant viewpoint changes while maintaining consistency and preserving unedited regions.

Conclusion: Sketch3DVE effectively addresses the challenges of 3D-aware video editing, enabling detailed local manipulation with precise geometry control and seamless integration of edited content into original videos with viewpoint changes.

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

TL;DR: Is-NeRF introduces scattering-aware volume rendering with explicit lightpath modeling to handle motion blur in Neural Radiance Fields, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NeRF uses straight-line volume rendering which struggles with complex lightpaths and introduces geometric ambiguities, especially when processing motion-blurred images.

Method: Proposes a deblur neural radiance field with explicit lightpath modeling, unifying six light propagation phenomena through in-scattering representation. Uses adaptive learning strategy for autonomous scattering direction determination and sampling intervals.

Result: Effectively handles complex real-world scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate geometric details.

Conclusion: The scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline with explicit lightpath modeling successfully addresses NeRF's limitations in handling motion blur and complex light propagation scenarios.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

TL;DR: PMBM filter applied to pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding boxes with standard point-object model, revealing model-data mismatch issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address pedestrian tracking using methods from radar tracking community and 2D bounding box detections, exploring the applicability of PMBM filter in this domain.

Method: Used Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter with standard point-object model, parameter selection from first principles and MOT-17 dataset, with continuous time parameter discussion.

Result: The PMBM algorithm shows promising results but reveals a mismatch between the standard point-object model and the actual data.

Conclusion: Model-based approach suggests that addressing the components causing SPO model-data mismatch will lead to improved model-based algorithms in future developments.

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A mobile surveillance robot that streams real-time video, responds to voice commands, and uses YOLOv3 for object detection, built with Raspberry Pi 4 units and open-source software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an accessible, reproducible surveillance robot system that enables remote monitoring and voice-controlled navigation using off-the-shelf hardware and open software.

Method: Uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units - one for mobile platform with camera/mic/speaker, another for central processing. Employs FFmpeg for video streaming, YOLOv3 for object detection, Python libraries for speech recognition/translation/TTS, and Kinect RGB-D sensor for obstacle detection.

Result: Successfully detects common objects at interactive frame rates on CPU, reliably recognizes voice commands, and translates them to actions without manual control in indoor environments.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates a functional, reproducible surveillance robot using affordable hardware and open software, with identified potential improvements including sensor fusion, GPU acceleration, and additional recognition capabilities.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

### [152] [ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488)
*Jingwen Yu,Jiayi Yang,Anjun Hu,Jiankun Wang,Ping Tan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER is a loop closure verification method that uses historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loop closure verification methods focus on appearance features but neglect spatial-temporal motion cues (trajectory), making them vulnerable to false positives in repetitive environments with high visual similarity.

Method: For each loop candidate, estimate robot trajectory using pose-graph optimization, then score its compliance with the trajectory prior (without the loop) to determine acceptance.

Result: Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate effectiveness, and integration into state-of-the-art SLAM systems verifies robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: ROVER successfully leverages trajectory prior knowledge to improve loop closure verification in challenging repetitive environments, reducing false positives while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MimicFunc enables robots to learn tool manipulation from single human videos and generalize to novel tools using function-level correspondences with keypoint-based abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching robots through human video imitation provides intuitive learning and scalable alternative to teleoperation, but current robots struggle with generalization across functionally similar tools with geometric variations.

Method: Proposes MimicFunc framework that establishes functional correspondences using function frame - a function-centric local coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction for tool manipulation imitation.

Result: Effectively enables robots to generalize skills from single RGB-D human video to manipulate novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks, and generates rollouts for training visuomotor policies without teleoperation.

Conclusion: MimicFunc addresses intra-function variations in tools through function-level correspondences, enabling one-shot generalization and scalable policy learning from human demonstrations.

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional
management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first
systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based
Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based
Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based
Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term
semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this
comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the
foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal
integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we
outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data
models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized
benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management
solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than
180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust,

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating 3D object recognition and localization technologies to transform cobots into mobile, reconfigurable production assistants for sheet-metal workshops facing small series and varying orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs in sheet-metal workshops struggle with high-mix-low-volume production where standard automation fails, leading to repetitive manual labor, increased costs, and underutilization of skilled workforce.

Method: Integration of existing technologies including 3D object recognition and localization to enhance cobotic systems, with insights from a previous project by ACRO research unit and industrial partner.

Result: The project outlines key steps and explores both opportunities and challenges of implementing mobile, reconfigurable cobotic assistants in industrial settings.

Conclusion: Cobots enhanced with 3D recognition and localization technologies can address automation challenges in high-mix-low-volume sheet-metal production, though implementation presents both opportunities and challenges that need to be carefully addressed.

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are
challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions
tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting
production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their
full potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile
and reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,
including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both
the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these
technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the
process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO
research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete
implementation example throughout.

*Jianqiu Chen,Siqi Li,Xu He*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A synergistic framework combining LLM reasoning with gm/Id methodology enables efficient analog IC design automation, achieving expert-level quality with 10x efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog IC design is bottlenecked by experience dependency and inefficient simulations, with traditional formulas failing in advanced nodes. Direct LLM application risks guessing without engineering principles.

Method: Synergistic reasoning framework integrating LLM's strategic reasoning with physical precision of gm/Id methodology using lookup tables, making LLM a quantitative, data-driven design partner.

Result: Validated on two-stage op-amp: Gemini model met all TT corner specs in 5 iterations and extended optimization to all PVT corners. Achieved quasi-expert quality with order-of-magnitude efficiency improvement vs senior engineer.

Conclusion: This work validates a path for true analog design automation by combining LLM reasoning with scientific circuit design methodologies, with gm/Id data being crucial for efficiency and precision.

Abstract: Analog IC design is a bottleneck due to its reliance on experience and
inefficient simulations, as traditional formulas fail in advanced nodes.
Applying Large Language Models (LLMs) directly to this problem risks mere
"guessing" without engineering principles. We present a "synergistic reasoning"
framework that integrates an LLM's strategic reasoning with the physical
precision of the gm/Id methodology. By empowering the LLM with gm/Id lookup
tables, it becomes a quantitative, data-driven design partner.
  We validated this on a two-stage op-amp, where our framework enabled the
Gemini model to meet all TT corner specs in 5 iterations and extended
optimization to all PVT corners. A crucial ablation study proved gm/Id data is
key for this efficiency and precision; without it, the LLM is slower and
deviates. Compared to a senior engineer's design, our framework achieves
quasi-expert quality with an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. This
work validates a path for true analog design automation by combining LLM
reasoning with scientific circuit design methodologies.

### [157] [Image2Net: Datasets, Benchmark and Hybrid Framework to Convert Analog Circuit Diagrams into Netlists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13157)
*Haohang Xu,Chengjie Liu,Qihang Wang,Wenhao Huang,Yongjian Xu,Weiyu Chen,Anlan Peng,Zhijun Li,Bo Li,Lei Qi,Jun Yang,Yuan Du,Li Du*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A hybrid framework called Image2Net is proposed to convert image-based circuit diagrams to text-based netlists for LLM-based analog IC design, achieving 80.77% success rate and 62.1%-69.6% lower error than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show great potential for analog IC design but require text-based netlists, while existing circuits are mostly in image-based diagrams. Current conversion frameworks have limited support for image styles and circuit elements.

Method: Constructed a new dataset with diverse circuit diagram styles and proposed Image2Net hybrid framework for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. Introduced netlist edit distance (NED) for precise evaluation.

Result: Image2Net achieves 80.77% success rate (34.62%-45.19% higher than previous works) and 0.116 averaged NED (62.1%-69.6% lower than state-of-the-art methods).

Conclusion: The proposed Image2Net framework effectively converts complex circuit diagrams to netlists, enabling better LLM-based analog IC design with significantly improved accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog
integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and
generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog
ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog
ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than
text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to
enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion
frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of
image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging
task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this
end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of
circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog
ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical
conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED)
is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted
netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\%
successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.
Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is
62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Agents (CoA) is a new LLM reasoning paradigm that enables end-to-end complex problem-solving like multi-agent systems within a single model, using multi-agent distillation and agentic reinforcement learning to create Agent Foundation Models (AFMs) that achieve SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems rely on manual prompt/workflow engineering, making them computationally inefficient, less capable, and unable to benefit from data-centric learning. The authors aim to create a more efficient and capable end-to-end solution.

Method: Introduces Chain-of-Agents paradigm where models dynamically activate different tool agents and role-playing agents. Uses multi-agent distillation to distill SOTA multi-agent systems into CoA trajectories for supervised fine-tuning, followed by agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable tasks.

Result: Agent Foundation Models (AFMs) establish new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings.

Conclusion: The proposed Chain-of-Agents approach successfully creates efficient end-to-end problem-solving capabilities within single models, with open-sourced resources providing a foundation for future agent model research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace is a novel paradigm that addresses LLM context limitations by emulating human cognitive mechanisms, achieving 58.6% memory reuse vs 0% for traditional RAG with significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face fundamental limitations in context management despite extended context windows. Traditional retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human memory management, lacking metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities.

Method: Proposes Cognitive Workspace with three core innovations: (1) active memory management with deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Draws from cognitive science foundations including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and Hutchins' distributed cognition framework.

Result: Achieves average 58.6% memory reuse rate (54-60% across tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18% net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis confirms advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple task types.

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace represents a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive augmentation, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory superiority in LLM systems and synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive

Motivation: To enhance foundational capabilities and generalization of text-to-SQL models for real-world applications by improving semantic parsing of WHERE clauses in SQL queries.

Method: Integrates model interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy, augmented with filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion to create CESQL model for conditional enhancement.

Result: Excels on WikiSQL dataset for single-table database queries, significantly boosts prediction accuracy, reduces dependency on condition column data, and avoids impact of manually labeled training data.

Conclusion: Provides fresh perspectives for handling complex queries and irregular data scenarios in real-world database environments through improved basic query processing accuracy.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-hop personalized reasoning task to evaluate memory mechanisms in LLM agents for complex reasoning over user information, introduces a dataset and evaluation framework, implements various memory methods, and proposes HybridMem as an effective hybrid approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory approaches in LLM agents focus on preference alignment and simple QA, but real-world complex tasks require multi-hop reasoning over large amounts of user information, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Defined multi-hop personalized reasoning task, constructed dataset and evaluation framework, implemented various explicit and implicit memory methods, explored hybrid approaches, and proposed HybridMem method combining both paradigms.

Result: Comprehensive experiments evaluated performance from multiple perspectives, analyzed strengths/weaknesses of different memory mechanisms, and demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed HybridMem model.

Conclusion: The work addresses limitations of current memory approaches for complex reasoning tasks, provides a standardized evaluation framework, and shows hybrid memory methods like HybridMem effectively handle multi-hop personalized reasoning challenges.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER is an agentic table extraction system that handles messy, multi-page financial tables through continuous learning and schema-guided extraction, outperforming existing models by 10.1% and improving extraction quality through actionable schema recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world financial documents contain essential information buried in messy, multi-page tables with complex structures (99.4% without bounding boxes, up to 426 rows across 44 pages), requiring specialized extraction systems.

Method: TASER uses table agents for detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations leveraging an initial schema, with a Recommender Agent that reviews outputs, suggests schema revisions, and enables continuous learning through larger batch sizes.

Result: Outperforms Table Transformer by 10.1%, achieves 104.3% increase in actionable schema recommendations, and 9.8% increase in extracted holdings. Dataset includes 22,584 pages with 28M+ tokens and $731B+ holdings.

Conclusion: Agentic, schema-guided extraction systems show promise for robust understanding of real-world financial tables, with continuous learning significantly improving extraction performance and schema quality.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LLM approaches generated only one strategy directly, leading to incorrect generalized plans if the strategy was flawed. The paper aims to improve reliability by detecting and fixing errors earlier in the process.

Method: Three key extensions: 1) Generate strategy as pseudocode with automatic debugging before program generation, 2) Add reflection step during Python debugging to identify failure reasons, 3) Generate multiple program variants and select the best one.

Result: Substantial improvement in generalized plan quality across 17 benchmark domains, with no deterioration. In 12 domains, the best programs solve all generatable tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed extensions significantly enhance LLM-based generalized planning by catching errors earlier and producing more robust solutions through multiple variant generation and selection.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Motivation: RL is underutilized for complex vision-language tasks requiring structured outputs, and SFT alone hits performance plateaus in chart-to-code generation despite data scaling.

Method: Multimodal Structured RL (MSRL) with multi-granularity rewards: rule-based textual rewards for code details and model-based visual rewards comparing rendered images, implemented in a two-stage curriculum.

Result: MSRL breaks SFT plateau, improving metrics by 6.2% on ChartMimic and 9.9% on ReachQA benchmarks, achieving competitive performance with closed-source models.

Conclusion: Structured multimodal RL effectively overcomes SFT limitations for complex vision-language tasks requiring structured code generation from charts.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.
