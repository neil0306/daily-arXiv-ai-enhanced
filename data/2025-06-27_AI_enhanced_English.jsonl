This work introduces MADrive, a\nmemory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities\nof existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with\nvisually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.\nSpecifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\\sim}70$K 360{\\deg}\ncar videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the\nmost similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding\n3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through\norientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide\ncomplete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling\nphotorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as\ndemonstrated in our experiments.

An area of\nmachine learning that has not yet been explored is neural ordinary differential\nequation (neural ODE) based residual neural networks (ResNets), which aim to\nimprove the effectiveness of neural networks using the principles of ordinary\ndifferential equations. In this work, we present our insights about why analog\nRydberg atom quantum computers are especially well-suited for ResNets. We also\nintroduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom\nquantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using\nanalog quantum neural ODEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ResQ, a new framework, leverages Rydberg atom quantum computers for neural ODE-based ResNets, optimizing quantum dynamics for machine learning classification.", "motivation": "To explore the untapped potential of quantum computing in neural ODE-based ResNets, particularly using Rydberg atom quantum computers.", "method": "Introduces ResQ, a framework optimizing Rydberg atom quantum computer dynamics for analog quantum neural ODEs in classification tasks.", "result": "Demonstrates the suitability of Rydberg atom quantum computers for ResNets and proposes a practical framework (ResQ) for implementation.", "conclusion": "Rydberg atom quantum computers are promising for neural ODE-based ResNets, with ResQ providing a viable optimization approach."}}
