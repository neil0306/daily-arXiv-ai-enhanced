Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences.

However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics.

To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity.

This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the \"Deployable by Design\" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline.

Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation.

To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT.

However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions.

This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains.

This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets.

However, its inherent strong nonlinearity often results in convergence toward local minima. Recently, deep image prior-based reparameterized FWI (DIP-FWI) has been proposed to alleviate the dependence on massive training data. By exploiting the spectral bias and implicit regularization in the neural network architecture, DIP-FWI can effectively avoid local minima and reconstruct more geologically plausible velocity models. Nevertheless, existing DIP-FWI typically use a fixed random input throughout the inversion process, which fails to utilize the mapping and correlation between the input and output of the network. Moreover, under complex geological conditions, the lack of informative prior in the input can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, leading to artifacts and unstable reconstructions. To address these limitations, we propose a self-reinforced DIP-FWI (SRDIP-FWI) framework, in which a steering algorithm alternately updates both the network parameters and the input at each iteration using feedback from the current network output. This design allows adaptive structural enhancement and improved regularization, thereby effectively mitigating the ill-posedness in FWI. Additionally, we analyze the spectral bias of the network in SRDIP-FWI and quantify its role in multiscale velocity model building. Synthetic tests and field land data application demonstrate that SRDIP-FWI achieves superior resolution, improved accuracy and greater depth penetration compared to multiscale FWI.

We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views.
