A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge\nstored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two\ncategories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning\non externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),\nwhich depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual\ndocuments. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while\nGAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to\nunconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine\nanswer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified\nretrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external\nand parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:\nKnowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to\nproduce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by\nretrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively\nselects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form\nconcise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments\non five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%\nimprovement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the\neffectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive\nreasoning.

To aggregate contextual\ncues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected\nentities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between\nhumans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on\npairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios\noften emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in\njoint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group\nview and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information\nin terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the\ngeometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters\nusing a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from\nbounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via\nself-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the\nsemantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction\ndecoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments\non HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over\nthe state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs use depth in a structured \"Guess-then-Refine\" pattern where early layers make high-frequency token guesses that get refined into contextually appropriate tokens in later layers, with different computational depth requirements for different linguistic tasks.", "motivation": "To understand the fine-grained layer-wise prediction dynamics of large language models and how they use their computational depth during inference, as current evidence suggests non-uniform depth usage.", "method": "Tracing intermediate representations of open-weight models during inference, analyzing token frequency patterns, and conducting three case studies: part-of-speech analysis, fact recall tasks, and multiple-choice tasks.", "result": "Early layers predict high-frequency tokens as statistical guesses (refined >70% of the time), function words are predicted earliest, first tokens in multi-token answers require more depth, and response format is identified early but finalized late.", "conclusion": "LLMs employ a structured depth usage pattern with early guessing and later refinement, providing insights for improving computational efficiency in transformer models."}}
