In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image\nQuality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity\nlevels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust\nper-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure\nconsistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single\narchitecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the\nimportance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration\nimproves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when\ncombined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from\n0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),\nPositioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)\nartifact severity classification.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability.
