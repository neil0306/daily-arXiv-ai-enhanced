TL;DR: Analysis of Chain-of-Thought reasoning attribution patterns in multilingual LLMs reveals limitations in faithfulness and interpretability across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the faithfulness and interpretability of CoT reasoning chains in multilingual LLMs, addressing concerns about their reliability across different languages.

Method: Applied ContextCite (step-level) and Inseq (token-level) attribution methods to Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using MGSM benchmark, with controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences.

Result: Attribution scores overemphasize final reasoning steps in incorrect generations; structured CoT improves accuracy mainly for high-resource Latin-script languages; perturbations reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence.

Conclusion: CoT prompting has limitations in multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency, particularly showing reduced effectiveness for non-Latin-script and low-resource languages.

Abstract: This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Motion2Mind is a framework and dataset for evaluating AI's Theory of Mind capabilities in interpreting nonverbal cues, revealing current AI systems struggle significantly with this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM benchmarks focus mainly on false-belief tasks and overlook nonverbal communication and mental states beyond belief, creating a gap in evaluating machines' ability to interpret human nonverbal cues.

Method: Created Motion2Mind framework using expert-curated body-language references as knowledge base, building a video dataset with 222 nonverbal cue types and 397 mind states, featuring fine-grained annotations and manually verified psychological interpretations.

Result: Current AI systems show substantial performance gap in detecting nonverbal cues and exhibit patterns of over-interpretation in explanation compared to human annotators.

Conclusion: Motion2Mind provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI's nonverbal cue interpretation capabilities, highlighting significant limitations in current systems and the need for improved ToM reasoning in machines.

Abstract: Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

### [3] [TOD-ProcBench: Benchmarking Complex Instruction-Following in Task-Oriented Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15976)
*Sarik Ghazarian,Abhinav Gullapalli,Swair Shah,Anurag Beniwal,Nanyun Peng,Narayanan Sadagopan,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOD-ProcBench is a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to follow complex process instructions in multi-turn task-oriented dialogues, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that oversimplify instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TOD benchmarks oversimplify complex real-world instructions by reducing them to simple schemas, failing to capture the intricate constraints and step-by-step procedures that agents must follow in practical settings.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset from ABCD dataset with human quality control, formulated constraints as multi-level condition-action statements, and designed three tasks: relevant statement retrieval and action prediction, identification of instruction-violating responses, and conditional generation of compliant responses.

Result: The benchmark systematically evaluates LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities across multiple dimensions including multilingual settings and different instruction formats.

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench provides a comprehensive framework for benchmarking LLMs' ability to understand and adhere to complex process instructions in task-oriented dialogues, addressing a critical gap in existing evaluation methods.

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

*Kieron Kretschmar,Walter Laurito,Sharan Maiya,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIARS' BENCH is a comprehensive testbed with 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses from four LLMs across seven datasets, designed to evaluate lie detection techniques for diverse types of lies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lie detection techniques for LLMs are validated in narrow settings that don't capture the diverse lies models can generate, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: Created a testbed with lies varying along two dimensions: model's reason for lying and object of belief targeted. Evaluated three black- and white-box detection techniques on this benchmark.

Result: Existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, particularly when it's impossible to determine lying from the transcript alone.

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior lie detection techniques and provides a practical testbed to guide future progress in this area.

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

### [5] [Learning Tractable Distributions Of Language Model Continuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16054)
*Gwen Yidou-Weng,Ian Li,Anji Liu,Oliver Broadrick,Guy Van den Broeck,Benjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTLA is a hybrid approach that combines a base language model with a tractable surrogate (HMM) to enable controlled text generation with sequence-level constraints, addressing efficiency issues in neural context integration while improving constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlled language generation using tractable surrogates like HMMs are weakly context-aware, reducing query quality, and face efficiency issues when integrating neural context.

Method: LTLA pairs a base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities, using single batched HMM updates and conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on LM's hidden representations.

Result: LTLA achieves higher conditional likelihood than unconditional HMMs, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where standalone HMMs fail, and improves constraint satisfaction with comparable fluency and minimal inference overhead.

Conclusion: LTLA effectively addresses efficiency and context-awareness limitations in controlled language generation, enabling better constraint satisfaction while maintaining fluency through hybrid modeling.

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

Method: Collection of short case studies documenting human-GPT-5 interactions across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science, with careful verification by human experts.

Result: GPT-5 produced new concrete research steps and four new verified mathematical results, accelerating scientific work while requiring human input for guidance and verification.

Conclusion: GPT-5 shows significant potential as a scientific research tool, capable of helping settle previously unsolved problems, though human expertise remains essential for guidance and verification.

Abstract: AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science. In these examples, the authors highlight how AI accelerated their work, and where it fell short; where expert time was saved, and where human input was still key. We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.

### [7] [ELPO: Ensemble Learning Based Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16122)
*Qing Zhang,Bing Xu,Xudong Zhang,Yifan Shi,Yang Li,Chen Zhang,Yik Chung Wu,Ngai Wong,Yijie Chen,Hong Dai,Xiansen Chen,Mian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELPO is a novel ensemble learning-based framework for automatic prompt optimization that outperforms existing methods by combining multiple generation strategies and search methods through voting mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt engineering is laborious and existing automatic prompt optimization methods are limited by using single models/algorithms, which restricts performance on complex tasks.

Method: Proposes ELPO framework that uses ensemble learning with voting mechanism, shared generation strategies, and different search methods to find superior prompts, along with more efficient algorithms for prompt generation and search.

Result: ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, achieving improvements like 7.6 F1 score increase on ArSarcasm dataset.

Conclusion: The ensemble learning approach in ELPO provides more accurate and robust automatic prompt optimization compared to single-algorithm methods, demonstrating significant performance gains across various tasks.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

*Dabiao Ma,Ziming Dai,Zhimin Xin,Shu Wang,Ye Wang,Haojun Fei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TS-PEFT introduces selective parameter modification instead of applying PEFT to all position indices, showing that indiscriminate PEFT application can be counterproductive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the necessity of traditional PEFT that applies modifications to all position indices and explore if selective modification can improve downstream task performance.

Method: Proposes Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT) where a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to only a subset of position indices rather than all indices.

Result: Experimental results show that indiscriminate PEFT application to all indices is not only unnecessary but can be counterproductive, while selective modification potentially enhances performance.

Conclusion: The study advocates for a more targeted approach to PEFT modifications and provides a framework for optimizing fine-tuning processes in large models.

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.

### [10] [SeSE: A Structural Information-Guided Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16275)
*Xingtao Zhao,Hao Peng,Dingli Su,Xianghua Zeng,Chunyang Liu,Jinzhi Liao,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeSE is a novel uncertainty quantification framework that uses semantic structural entropy to detect hallucinations in LLMs by modeling semantic spaces as directed graphs and analyzing their hierarchical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UQ methods overlook latent semantic structural information, which could provide more precise uncertainty estimates for detecting hallucinations in safety-critical LLM applications.

Method: Developed an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm to capture semantic dependencies, then defined SeSE as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree after hierarchical abstraction and compression.

Result: Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

Conclusion: SeSE provides a principled framework for quantifying semantic uncertainty from a structural information perspective, enabling reliable hallucination detection in LLMs.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

*Wei Xia,Zhi-Hong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDA is a training-free, model-agnostic alignment framework that dynamically adjusts LLM output probabilities based on user instructions to improve alignment with human intent across helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their responses align with human intent without costly retraining or extensive supervision remains a critical challenge.

Method: Proposes SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment) - a lightweight framework that dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, working without fine-tuning and being compatible with various open-source LLMs.

Result: SDA consistently improved alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs, achieving average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty, and 11.5% in harmlessness across three key alignment dimensions (3H).

Conclusion: SDA is an effective and generalizable framework that enhances LLM alignment with human intent across diverse models and scenarios without requiring retraining, supporting both independent inference use and integration with training-based strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

### [12] [Incorporating Self-Rewriting into Large Language Model Reasoning Reinforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16331)
*Jiashu Yao,Heyan Huang,Shuang Zeng,Chuwei Luo,WangJie You,Jie Tang,Qingsong Liu,Yuhang Guo,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-rewriting framework improves reasoning quality by having models rewrite their own reasoning texts, achieving better accuracy with shorter reasoning and mitigating internal reasoning flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-sided correctness rewards in reinforcement learning limit supervision over internal reasoning process, leading to suboptimal reasoning quality with issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking.

Method: Self-rewriting framework where models rewrite their own reasoning texts, using selective rewriting on 'simple' samples (consistently correct) to preserve original reward signals, with rewriting and vanilla generation compiled in single batches for scalability.

Result: Achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) without explicit length reduction instructions, and significantly higher internal reasoning quality scores (+7.2) under LLM-as-a-judge metric.

Conclusion: Self-rewriting effectively improves internal reasoning quality and accuracy-length tradeoff, successfully mitigating reasoning flaws while maintaining RL scalability with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

*Blake Matheny,Phuong Minh Nguyen,Minh Le Nguyen,Stephanie Reynolds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses LLMs' difficulty with idiomatic and figurative language by creating new datasets for training and evaluation, including one large-scale dataset and two human-annotated datasets for idiom recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Idioms and figurative language remain challenging for LLMs despite large training corpora, creating a need for specialized datasets to improve model performance on colloquial language.

Method: Combined existing idiom datasets to create a master list, retrieved context sequences from large corpus, created three datasets (one large-scale, two human-annotated), post-processed for model compatibility, and used for training and evaluation on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

Result: Developed comprehensive datasets for idiomatic and figurative language that can be used to train and evaluate LLMs on idiom recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The created datasets provide a foundation for developing better approaches to handle figurative language in LLMs through finetuning and specialized training.

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

### [14] [Learning from Sufficient Rationales: Analysing the Relationship Between Explanation Faithfulness and Token-level Regularisation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16353)
*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the limitations of sufficiency as a metric for rationale informativeness and explores how rationale information affects model performance through token classification and attention regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how rationales (human explanations) help assess whether models learn for the right reasons, and to address the limited insights provided by sufficiency metrics alone.

Method: Relates sufficiency to two modeling paradigms: token classification (identifying rationale tokens) and attention regularization (incorporating rationales in input). Analyzes how rationale information affects cross-domain classification.

Result: Highly informative rationales don't necessarily help correct classification; sufficiency captures interference from non-rationalized context. Rationale incorporation can boost cross-domain classification but results vary by task and model. Sufficiency and token classification appear unrelated.

Conclusion: Rationales are complex, and current metrics like sufficiency don't systematically capture rationale information, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

TL;DR: MinerU-HTML improves web data extraction by using a language model instead of heuristics, achieving better structure preservation and downstream model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web data extraction methods like Trafilatura struggle to preserve document structure and corrupt elements like formulas, codes, and tables, limiting data quality for LLM training.

Method: Reformulates content extraction as sequence labeling using a 0.6B-parameter language model with a two-stage formatting pipeline that categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown.

Result: Achieves 81.8% ROUGE-N F1 vs Trafilatura's 63.6%, with 90.9% code block and 94.0% formula preservation. Models trained on AICC corpus outperform Trafilatura-extracted data by 1.08pp across 13 benchmarks.

Conclusion: HTML extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities and should be treated as a critical component of web corpus construction, not just a preprocessing step.

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

*Connor McElroy,Thiago E. A. de Oliveira,Chris Brogly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived low-quality from high-quality news articles using linguistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if automated methods can reliably differentiate between perceived lower-quality and higher-quality news articles at scale.

Method: Used 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models on 1.4M news articles from Common Crawl (2018-2024), with expert ratings split into low/high-quality classes and 194 linguistic features per article.

Result: Random Forest achieved 0.7355 accuracy and 0.8131 ROC AUC. ModernBERT-large performed best with 0.8744 accuracy and 0.9593 ROC-AUC, followed by DistilBERT-base variants.

Conclusion: Both traditional machine learning and deep learning models can effectively differentiate perceived news quality, with deep learning achieving superior performance.

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how transformers process idiomatic expressions using circuit discovery techniques, identifying specialized "Idiom Heads" and "augmented reception" mechanisms that balance computational efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based language models handle non-compositional language like idioms, and to uncover the computational mechanisms that enable efficient processing of such linguistic constructions.

Method: Used a modified path patching algorithm for circuit discovery and analysis, identifying specialized attention heads ("Idiom Heads") and examining attention patterns between idiom tokens.

Result: Discovered distinct computational patterns for idiom processing, identified "Idiom Heads" that activate across different idioms, and found evidence of "augmented reception" - enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness when processing non-compositional language, providing insights for understanding more complex grammatical constructions.

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

### [20] [TurkColBERT: A Benchmark of Dense and Late-Interaction Models for Turkish Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16528)
*Özay Ezerceli,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Selva Taş,Reyhan Bayraktar,Fatma Betül Terzioğlu,Yusuf Çelebi,Yağız Asker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TurkColBERT is the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish IR, showing that smaller late-interaction models significantly outperform larger dense encoders while being more parameter-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural IR systems are underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages like Turkish, and late-interaction models haven't been systematically evaluated for Turkish retrieval despite dense bi-encoders currently dominating the field.

Method: Two-stage adaptation pipeline: fine-tune English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then convert them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. Evaluated 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains.

Result: Strong parameter efficiency: 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600× smaller than 600M turkish-e5-large while preserving over 71% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models 3-5× smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8% mAP on domain-specific tasks. MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33× faster than PLAID with +1.7% relative mAP gain.

Conclusion: Late-interaction models offer superior performance and efficiency for Turkish IR, enabling low-latency retrieval (0.54 ms query times). The study provides production-ready solutions but notes limitations including reliance on moderately sized datasets and translated benchmarks.

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs is crucial for safe deployment, but interpretability is difficult and human evaluation of all outputs is impractical.

Method: Used Mistral-7B and two datasets to extract genre information from LLM activations using scikit-learn classifiers.

Result: Achieved F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% for genre prediction, consistently outperforming control tasks.

Conclusion: Text genres can be effectively inferred from LLM activations using shallow learning models, providing a proof of concept for predictive frameworks.

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current ASR evaluation metrics like WER poorly correlate with clinical impact. This paper introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge framework optimized with GEPA that achieves human-comparable performance in assessing clinical safety of ASR errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ASR evaluations rely heavily on WER, but there's a need to assess whether these metrics actually correlate with clinical impact of transcription errors in healthcare settings.

Method: Established gold-standard benchmark with expert clinicians labeling clinical impact of ASR errors, then introduced LLM-as-a-Judge framework programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment.

Result: WER and other common metrics correlate poorly with clinician-assigned risk labels. The optimized Gemini-2.5-Pro judge achieved 90% accuracy and strong Cohen's κ of 0.816, comparable to human performance.

Conclusion: Provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

*Kexin Zhao,Ken Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for word sense disambiguation using LLMs as oracles without hand-annotated training data, converting candidate meanings into natural language alternatives for LLM selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSD methods rely on coarse-grained representations and hand-annotated data, making it difficult to disambiguate richer representations needed for sophisticated inference.

Method: Convert multiple candidate meanings from symbolic NLU into distinguishable natural language alternatives, query LLM to select appropriate interpretations based on context, and propagate selections back to symbolic system.

Result: Method evaluated against human-annotated gold answers demonstrates effectiveness.

Conclusion: Proposed approach enables automatic disambiguation of richer representations without requiring hand-annotated training data.

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Direct multimodal embedding retrieval outperforms text-based approaches in multimodal RAG systems by preserving visual context, achieving 13% absolute improvement in mAP@5 and 11% in nDCG@5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal RAG systems lose contextual information and visual details by converting images to text through LLM summarization during preprocessing, which is critical for financial document analysis.

Method: Comparative analysis of text-based chunk retrieval (images summarized to text) vs direct multimodal embedding retrieval (images stored natively in vector space), evaluated across 6 LLM models and 2 multimodal embedding models on a financial earnings call benchmark.

Result: Direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches with 13% absolute improvement in mAP@5 and 11% in nDCG@5, corresponding to 32% and 20% relative improvements respectively.

Conclusion: Direct multimodal retrieval preserves visual context better than LLM summarization, leading to more accurate and factually consistent answers, demonstrating that native multimodal embeddings are superior for retrieval and inference tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Nemotron Elastic is a framework that embeds multiple nested submodels within a single parent LLM, enabling zero-shot extraction of different-sized models without additional training, achieving massive cost reduction compared to traditional model family training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training separate LLMs for different scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, and existing compression methods still incur significant training costs per compressed model.

Method: Uses hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures with end-to-end trained router, two-stage training curriculum, group-aware SSM elastification, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance, and knowledge distillation for multi-budget optimization.

Result: Applied to Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, produced 9B and 6B models using only 110B training tokens, achieving 360x cost reduction vs training from scratch and 7x vs SoTA compression. All nested models perform on par or better than SoTA in accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables many-in-one reasoning models with constant deployment memory against family size, unlike other compression methods.

Abstract: Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.

TL;DR: UniFit is a universal virtual try-on framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models to bridge semantic gaps between text instructions and reference images, enabling flexible handling of diverse VTON tasks with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON methods struggle with semantic gaps between text instructions and reference images, and face data scarcity in complex scenarios, limiting their universal applicability.

Method: Proposes MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA) that integrates multimodal inputs using MLLM and learnable queries with semantic alignment loss, plus two-stage progressive training with self-synthesis pipeline.

Result: UniFit supports wide range of VTON tasks including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, achieving state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: UniFit successfully addresses key limitations in VTON by leveraging MLLM for semantic alignment and progressive training, enabling universal framework for diverse try-on tasks.

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3's unified architecture with shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, and dense-memory tracker is too computationally expensive for on-device deployment, requiring more efficient alternatives.

Method: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) in three stages: Encoder Distillation for image features, Temporal Memory Distillation using Perceiver-based module for spatiotemporal features, and End-to-End Fine-Tuning on SAM3 PCS data.

Result: Created multiple student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones that achieve strong performance-efficiency trade-offs on VOS datasets while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior.

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3 enables on-device concept segmentation and tracking while preserving concept-level performance through efficient distillation from the larger SAM3 model.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel extensions for model-based 6D pose estimation that improve accuracy under occlusion through dynamic sampling, multi-hypothesis inference, iterative refinement, and occlusion-focused training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D object pose estimation methods struggle with unseen objects and are prone to error propagation under occlusion due to their multi-stage pipeline structure.

Method: Four key extensions: dynamic non-uniform dense sampling focusing on visible regions, multi-hypothesis inference with confidence-ranked candidates, iterative refinement, and occlusion-focused training augmentations.

Result: Achieves >5% accuracy improvement on ICBIN and >2% on BOP benchmarks with approximately 3x faster inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances robustness to occlusion in 6D pose estimation while improving both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to generate synthetic historical maps by transferring cartographic styles onto vector data, addressing the scarcity of annotated training data for deep learning in historical document analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps lack sufficient annotated training data for deep learning methods, and creating such data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Synthetic data often lacks realism and diversity needed for effective learning.

Method: Proposes automatic deep generative approach and manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate visual uncertainty and noise in historical map scans. Transfers cartographic style of original maps onto vector data to create synthetic training samples.

Result: Generated effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for land-cover interpretation tasks. Used Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation to evaluate the approach.

Conclusion: The data bootstrapping methods successfully address the training data scarcity problem for homogeneous historical map corpora, enabling effective domain-adaptive semantic segmentation through synthetic map generation.

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D is a category-level 6D pose estimation method for warehouse storage boxes that uses binary search for dimension inference and category CAD templates, achieving competitive accuracy with 76% faster inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods have limitations: model-based methods require exact CAD models and transfer poorly, model-free methods fail under challenging conditions, and category-level approaches ignore environment/object priors, limiting industrial practicality.

Method: Box6D infers box dimensions via fast binary search and estimates poses using category CAD templates from single RGB-D observations, employing depth-based plausibility filters and early-stopping strategies to reject implausible hypotheses.

Result: Evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks show Box6D delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Conclusion: Box6D provides an effective balance of flexibility and accuracy for warehouse applications, overcoming limitations of existing methods while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage self-improvement method that uses VLM-generated rationales as intermediate supervision to bridge the rationale gap in domain-specific video classification, achieving better performance than direct fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with domain-specific video classification due to a 'rationale gap' - sparse domain data can't bridge the semantic distance between complex video content and abstract labels.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate detailed textual rationales for videos using VLMs, then fine-tune on these self-generated rationales; 2) Perform conventional supervised fine-tuning on task labels after domain reasoning is acquired.

Result: Significantly outperforms direct supervised fine-tuning across diverse datasets, demonstrating effectiveness for domain-specific video analysis.

Conclusion: Self-generated rationales provide an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video tasks without new annotations.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

TL;DR: MGLL is a contrastive learning framework that improves multi-label and cross-granularity alignment in medical imaging by leveraging structured multi-label supervision and smooth KL divergence for cross-granularity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits effectiveness in medical imaging where images often have multiple high-level labels across different annotation granularities.

Method: Proposes Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL) framework with structured multi-label supervision, integration of textual descriptions across granularities, soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints, and smooth KL divergence for cross-granularity consistency.

Result: MGLL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks when pretrained on large-scale multi-granular datasets.

Conclusion: MGLL effectively addresses the limitations of CLIP in complex domains like medical imaging by enabling better multi-label and cross-granularity alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: Automated method to extract standard 2D echocardiography views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes using deep learning and anatomical heuristics, validated with 96% accuracy by cardiologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cardiac ultrasound uses 2D videos while 3D echocardiography offers better image quality and efficiency, but physicians prefer interpreting data in their usual 2D format.

Method: Deep learning view classifier combined with anatomical landmark heuristics from cardiologists to reconstruct standard echocardiography views from 3D volumes.

Result: 96% accuracy in blinded evaluation by three cardiologists on 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals; extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features for accurate clinical interpretation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges 3D scanning benefits with physician preference for 2D interpretation, enabling accurate cardiac abnormality detection and clinical-grade measurements from 3D volumes.

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph is the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding, enabling users to generate scene graphs from simple cues like clicks or bounding boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VSGG systems operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines without human guidance, while promptable segmentation models like SAM2 lack semantic or relational reasoning. There's a need to combine precise user interaction with comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: The framework uses a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head for joint entity and predicate reasoning. From a single user cue, it segments and tracks subjects across time, discovers interacting objects, and predicts triplets.

Result: Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing effective combination of human prompting with panoptic grounding and relational inference.

Conclusion: Click2Graph enables controllable and interpretable video scene understanding by unifying human prompting with comprehensive scene graph generation capabilities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

*Muyao Yuan,Yuanhong Zhang,Weizhan Zhang,Lan Ma,Yuan Gao,Jiangyong Ying,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP improves CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by using information-theoretic objectives to transfer alignment knowledge while maintaining vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment, which is problematic for open-vocabulary tasks.

Method: Proposes InfoCLIP with two information-theoretic objectives: compressing pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise, and maximizing mutual information between pretrained and fine-tuned models to transfer local semantic relations.

Result: Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate InfoCLIP's effectiveness in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoCLIP demonstrates adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by stabilizing modality alignment during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Conclusion: The consistency regularization approach effectively mitigates destructive task interference in multi-task learning, significantly improving generalization performance for breast ultrasound tumor segmentation across multiple external datasets.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed detection-guided generative framework effectively addresses the limitations of similarity-based approaches by providing hierarchical semantic token generation for unified visual semantic understanding.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Motivation: Existing debiasing methods for MLLMs require large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. Conventional ICL demonstration selection strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars.

Conclusion: FADS offers an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning, highlighting the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

*Nimeshika Udayangani,Hadi M. Dolatabadi,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph-based approach using GCNs to improve OOD detection in long-tailed vision datasets by exploiting inter-sample relationships and addressing tail-class performance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is challenging in long-tailed ID datasets, leading to high false positive rates and poor tail-class classification accuracy. Existing methods perform poorly on tail classes.

Method: Uses pre-trained model features to initialize graph structure, applies Gaussianization to normalize activations, and refines the graph using GCNs to create a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by large margins on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT benchmarks in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Graph-based representation with GCNs effectively improves OOD detection in long-tailed recognition scenarios by better handling inter-sample relationships and tail-class performance.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

TL;DR: Sequence-level optimization framework generates printable adversarial textures for clothing that maintain concealment across entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for human detection are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing wearable attack approaches fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation.

Method: Map product images to UV space with compact palette and control-point parameterization, use physically based human-garment pipeline to simulate motion, camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation, and optimize control points with expectation-over-transformation objective to minimize detection confidence across sequences.

Result: Strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, superior cross-model transferability, and physical garments achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates real-world feasibility for generating natural, printable adversarial textures that remain effective throughout entire walking sequences.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense Real-ISR models using LoRA fine-tuning cannot adaptively capture heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable efficient knowledge sharing under equivalent computational budgets.

Method: Proposes MoR architecture treating each LoRA rank as an independent expert, with shared experts for common features. Uses CLIP embeddings and text pairs for degradation estimation, zero-expert slots, and degradation-aware load-balancing loss for dynamic expert activation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validate the framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance in image super-resolution.

Conclusion: The MoR architecture successfully addresses limitations of dense Real-ISR models by enabling adaptive knowledge capture and efficient resource allocation through sparse expert activation guided by degradation severity.

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laser cutting generates hazardous dust and smoke, requiring real-time monitoring. Existing speckle sensing methods struggle with laser color changes.

Method: Train a CNN on laser speckle pattern dataset to classify materials, addressing the limitation of color sensitivity in traditional speckle sensing.

Result: 98.30% training accuracy, 96.88% validation accuracy, and 0.9643 F1-score on 3000 new images across 30 materials.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-based speckle pattern analysis provides robust and accurate material classification for safe laser cutting operations.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Conclusion: The curriculum-guided framework with student view generation and progressive training effectively addresses sparse-view challenges in 3DGS, achieving superior performance in sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

TL;DR: Proposes cross-modal learning to enhance satellite imagery with UAV-level detail for crop canopy trait estimation, bridging the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite missions have spatial resolution limitations that hinder effectiveness for modern micro-plot farming, while UAVs provide high-resolution data but have different limitations. Need to combine advantages of both modalities.

Method: Cross-modal learning strategy using co-registered satellite-UAV image pairs from 84 maize varieties across 5 locations, training models to learn fine-grained spectral-spatial correspondences between modalities.

Result: Generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on downstream tasks including yield and nitrogen prediction.

Conclusion: Cross-modal correspondence learning can effectively bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing for agricultural monitoring, enhancing satellite imagery with UAV-level visual detail.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Ee-Peng Lim,Qianru Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs to parse food images into titles and ingredients, then aligning text and image features in a shared embedding space to address domain shift, long-tailed distribution, and fine-grained classification in food recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition faces challenges including domain shift between training (Internet images) and test (real-world user images) data, long-tailed data distribution, and subtle visual differences between similar dishes.

Method: 1) Use LLMs to parse food images and generate food titles and ingredients; 2) Project generated texts and food images to a shared embedding space to maximize pair similarities; 3) Use aligned multimodal features for recognition.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods designed specifically for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification on two food datasets.

Conclusion: The simple LLM-powered framework effectively addresses multiple challenges in food recognition through multimodal alignment of visual and textual features.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

*Boxun Xu,Yu Wang,Zihu Wang,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMS-KV is a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for visual autoregressive models that reduces KV cache usage by 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48% while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains unexplored, with excessive KV memory growth limiting scalability as the number of scales increases.

Method: Systematic investigation revealed three key insights: local scale attention improves quality, condensed scales stabilize generation, and cache-demanding layers show weak inter-scale similarity. Based on these, AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales and optimizes cache utilization through inter-scale similarity analysis.

Result: AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. It enables stable scaling to batch size 256 where baseline models fail at batch size 128, with improved throughput.

Conclusion: AMS-KV effectively addresses KV memory bottlenecks in VAR models through scale-adaptive caching policies, significantly improving scalability and computational efficiency while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Conclusion: LiSTAR provides a powerful foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations with superior performance in 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Conclusion: Training strategy optimization is an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models, with potential applications in climate-related remote sensing like cloud classification.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Motivation: To investigate whether vision-language models can perform visual in-context learning when visual prompts and target images come from different visual tasks, unlocking cross-task VICL capabilities.

Method: Developed a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that implicitly describe differences between distinct low-level vision tasks, created the first cross-task VICL dataset, and proposed a novel inference framework combining perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The approach successfully unlocks the boundaries of cross-task visual in-context learning within vision-language models, enabling them to perform tasks across different visual domains.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models couple scale with content complexity, using more tokens for higher-resolution images. However, latent capacity should depend on content complexity rather than scale, which only serves as an upper bound.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities with flexible computation-quality tradeoff.

Conclusion: DCS-LDM provides a novel paradigm that successfully decouples information complexity from scale, enabling more efficient and flexible visual generation across various resolutions and frame rates.

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

### [54] [VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16124)
*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker is a novel Video Frame Interpolation pipeline that uses guided flow upsampling and texture mapping to address blurring and ghosting issues in high-resolution frame interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based VFI methods suffer from blur/mosaic artifacts at flow edges and misalignment of task-oriented flows due to low-resolution motion estimation, leading to ghosting and discontinuities in interpolated frames.

Method: Proposes VTinker with two core components: 1) Guided Flow Upsampling (GFU) that uses input frames as guidance to enhance flow edges, and 2) Texture Mapping that creates an intermediate proxy frame and selects clear texture blocks from input frames for final reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in Video Frame Interpolation, with code publicly available.

Conclusion: VTinker effectively addresses key challenges in high-resolution VFI by improving flow quality through guided upsampling and avoiding pixel-level artifacts through texture mapping, resulting in superior interpolation quality.

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods struggle with out-of-distribution generalization due to reliance on spurious shortcuts during training, and small feature-space perturbations can help mitigate this issue.

Method: Proposes PiN-CLIP that jointly trains a noise generator and detection network using variational positive-incentive principle. Constructs noise via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical features, then injects it to fine-tune the visual encoder to suppress shortcuts and amplify forensic cues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world dataset with 42 generative models, improving average accuracy by 5.4% over existing approaches.

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP effectively addresses out-of-distribution generalization in AI-generated image detection by suppressing shortcut learning and enhancing robust artifact representations through controlled feature-space perturbations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a blind video quality enhancement method with pretrained degradation representation learning and hierarchical termination mechanism to handle unknown quantization parameters and varying computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QECV methods rely on known QPs and use uniform architectures, limiting real-world applicability where QPs may be unknown and ignoring varying computational needs across compression levels.

Method: Uses pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module to extract multiscale degradation representations, and introduces hierarchical termination mechanism to dynamically adjust artifact reduction stages based on compression level.

Result: Achieves 110% PSNR improvement (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over state-of-the-art blind method at QP=22, and reduces average inference time by half at QP=22 compared to QP=42.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of existing blind QECV methods by providing detailed degradation guidance and adaptive computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs fail to ground language in multimodal social cues and lack ability to model others' knowledge/beliefs/intentions. The proposed framework demonstrates promising path toward building MLLMs with genuine human-like social reasoning.

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

*Chenyu Zhao,Xianwei Zheng,Zimin Xia,Linwei Yue,Nan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SR3D is a real-time 3D object detection framework for indoor point clouds that bridges the training-inference gap through spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment and rank-aware adaptive self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between how 3D object detectors are trained and evaluated, stemming from lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with ranking-based prediction selection used during inference.

Method: Uses spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment to emphasize well-located samples, and rank-aware adaptive self-distillation to inject ranking perception via self-distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show SR3D significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap in 3D object detection and achieves superior performance for indoor point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

### [59] [A Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception Attention for Remote Sensing Water Body Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16143)
*Quanqing Ma,Jiaen Chen,Peng Wang,Yao Zheng,Qingzhan Zhao,Yuchen Zheng*

TL;DR: Proposes HSRW-CD dataset for high-resolution water body change detection and SSCP attention module to better exploit spatial semantics and structural information in deep features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD and limitations of previous deep learning methods in fully utilizing spatial semantic and structural information in change detection networks.

Method: Develops HSRW-CD dataset with >3m spatial resolution covering various water body types, and designs SSCP attention module with three components: MSA for spatial semantics, SRGA for spatial structure/continuity, and CSA for channel similarity using semantic/structural priors.

Result: Numerous experiments on HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate effectiveness and generalization of SSCP module, significantly improving water body discrimination capability.

Conclusion: SSCP is an effective plug-and-play module that enhances WBCD performance by better leveraging spatial semantics and structural information, with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEGO-SLAM is the first real-time, open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that integrates language features through a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder, enabling semantic mapping with 60% Gaussian reduction while maintaining 15 FPS performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based SLAM systems create photorealistic maps but lack semantic understanding for robotic interaction. Integrating language features is challenging due to high memory demands and lack of adaptability to novel environments.

Method: Uses a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder to distill high-dimensional language embeddings into compact 16D features, language-guided pruning to reduce Gaussian count by 60%, and language-based loop detection that reuses mapping features without separate models.

Result: Achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS, with significant memory reduction and real-time performance.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM successfully integrates language understanding into 3DGS SLAM, enabling real-time semantic mapping with reduced computational overhead and improved adaptability for robotic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

TL;DR: RGE enhances multimodal embeddings by incorporating explicit reasoning from MLLMs through structured rationale generation before embedding extraction, improving retrieval performance by 4.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat embedding extraction as direct encoding, overlooking MLLMs' generative reasoning capability that could enhance representation quality.

Method: Proposes Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE) that preserves generative rationale process and couples it with contrastive training, enabling structured rationale generation before representation extraction.

Result: Experiments on MMEB benchmark show 4.9% improvement in multimodal retrieval performance over non-reasoning baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality by improving context-conditional inference signals within embeddings.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers have high computational costs due to large parameter counts, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. There's a need for efficient compression methods that maintain generation quality.

Method: Uses linear probing with first-order differential trend analysis to identify redundant layer intervals, then employs plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation for depth-wise and width-wise pruning in a single training phase.

Result: Achieves 50% parameter reduction compared to full model with less than 3% degradation in key metrics. Maintains high-quality image generation while achieving higher compression ratios.

Conclusion: PPCL provides an effective solution for deploying DiTs in resource-constrained environments through flexible structured pruning and knowledge distillation, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: Video2Layout framework reconstructs metric-grounded spatial layouts from video using continuous object boundary coordinates instead of discretized grid maps, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning and quantitative spatial computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grid-based map methods for spatial understanding in MLLMs rely on discretized raster representations, which limit fine-grained spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Supervised fine-tuning using AI2THOR simulator data to learn mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates; 2) Reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance real-world generalization. Uses continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object distances and sizes.

Result: V2LO-7B model achieves 4.92% average improvement over grid-map trained models on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, validating the superiority of continuous coordinate approach.

Conclusion: Continuous object boundary coordinates enable better quantitative spatial computation and alleviate ambiguity in spatial relationship descriptions, outperforming discretized grid-based methods for spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

TL;DR: Simba reformulates point cloud completion by replacing direct regression with distribution learning using diffusion models and Mamba-based upsampling, achieving SOTA performance while improving robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based methods for point cloud completion overfit to instance-specific transformations and are highly sensitive to input noise, limiting their generalization and robustness.

Method: Proposes Simba framework that uses diffusion models for distribution learning of symmetry transformations instead of direct regression, combined with hierarchical Mamba-based architecture for high-fidelity upsampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness to noise and better generalization.

Conclusion: Reformulating point cloud completion as distribution learning with diffusion models effectively addresses overfitting and noise sensitivity issues while preserving geometric structure details.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: TimeViper is a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model for long video understanding that processes hour-long videos with 10,000+ frames using a token compression module called TransV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in long video understanding requiring efficient architecture and effective temporal context handling, while overcoming vision token redundancy in multimodal models.

Method: Uses hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone combining state-space model efficiency with attention expressivity, plus TransV module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens.

Result: Competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame processing capabilities to hour-long videos, and provides insights into hybrid model interpretability through attention behavior analysis.

Conclusion: Represents initial step in developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures for long video understanding tasks.

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the clean-robustness trade-off and high training costs of adversarial training in medical image segmentation, providing a more scalable and maintainable solution for clinical deployment under distribution shifts.

Method: Inject small zero-mean noise at multiple layers during training to learn frequency-bias priors, then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on input/feature branches to suppress noise-sensitive bands and enhance directional structures while maintaining spectral consistency.

Result: On CT and ultrasound datasets, LNG-SWR consistently improves clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces performance drop under strong attacks (PGD-L∞/L₂ and SSAH), with additive gains when combined with adversarial training.

Conclusion: LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation that works in both adversarial and standard training regimes without sacrificing clean accuracy.

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods lack transparency for clinical adoption, and recent pathology agents have limitations including inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction with hierarchical analysis of pathology images and gene-stratified analysis, generating structured reports with chain-of-thought reasoning; (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference that retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superiority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

TL;DR: Proposes VTIA, a two-stage adversarial attack that injects imperceptible perturbations into images to induce VLMs to generate excessively verbose outputs, maximizing token length as an explicit objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods that only delay EOS token implicitly, lacking stability and controllability in inducing verbose outputs from VLMs, which increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adversarial prompt search using reinforcement learning to find prompts that induce verbose LLM outputs, 2) Vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial images that maximize similarity between visual embeddings and adversarial prompt embeddings.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs show significant advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VTIA successfully demonstrates the vulnerability of VLMs to verbose-text induction attacks, providing a more stable and controllable method for maximizing output token length through explicit optimization objectives.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks without truly completing them, limiting their effectiveness in long-horizon robotic manipulation.

Method: Three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR) using triplet contrastive learning with hard negatives; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE) grounding curiosity in relative object-gripper pose; and Long-Horizon Memory with selective context retention and gated fusion.

Result: Improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT) to 69.2%, achieves 1.5x better sample efficiency, reduces stage hallucination from 38.5% to 14.8%, and real-world deployment reaches 54.6% success rate (11 points better than baseline).

Conclusion: EvoVLA effectively addresses stage hallucination in VLA models, demonstrating superior performance in long-horizon manipulation tasks with strong sim-to-real transfer and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

TL;DR: Introduces Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first framework that interleaves textual reasoning throughout visual generation, enabling co-evolution of reasoning and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use reasoning either before or after generation, but lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during generation itself, limiting context-awareness and semantic richness.

Method: Three strategies: zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning via customized TwiG-GRPO strategy for interleaved reasoning.

Result: The framework produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs through dynamic interplay between reasoning and generation.

Conclusion: TwiG inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation, with code to be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-CLIP improves CLIP's dense prediction for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by identifying and filtering distraction tokens caused by dimension-specific over-activation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rarely investigate CLIP's performance boundaries for dense prediction from interpretability mechanisms perspective, particularly addressing attention diversion to irrelevant tokens.

Method: Propose RF-CLIP, a training-free approach that identifies distraction tokens from dimension-specific over-activation and redirects attention from these tokens back to target regions, emulating human distraction-refocusing behavior.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Filtering distraction tokens caused by dimension-specific over-activation significantly enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance and multimodal alignment granularity.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mantis is a novel VLA framework with Disentangled Visual Foresight that decouples visual prediction from the backbone using meta queries and diffusion Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance on robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models face challenges with high-dimensional visual state prediction distributing model capacity and incurring high training costs, while compressed visual signals create information bottlenecks and neglect language supervision, leading to poor comprehension and reasoning.

Method: Mantis uses Disentangled Visual Foresight with meta queries and a diffusion Transformer head. It decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone via residual connections, enabling meta queries to capture latent actions while maintaining language supervision for the backbone.

Result: Mantis achieves 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing baselines with high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show it outperforms π₀.₅ in instruction-following, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The disentangled approach effectively reduces backbone burden while maintaining language comprehension capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in robotics manipulation tasks and strong generalization to unseen instructions.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

*Nianchang Huang,Yi Xu,Ruida Xi,Ruida Xi,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DSLGA, a two-stage unsupervised domain adaptation method for Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification that addresses modality discrepancies between domains through domain-shared learning and gradual alignment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI-ReID algorithms perform well on public datasets but struggle with real-world data due to domain discrepancies, requiring a solution that can transfer knowledge without new annotations.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) for pre-training to mitigate inter-domain modality discrepancies, and 2) Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) for fine-tuning to handle intra-domain modality discrepancies through cluster-to-holistic alignment.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods across various settings.

Conclusion: DSLGA effectively addresses the challenges of UDA-VI-ReID by handling both inter-domain and intra-domain modality discrepancies, enabling successful knowledge transfer from public datasets to real-world applications without requiring new annotations.

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrIntMesh is a template-based framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems by jointly deforming all substructures while preserving topology and internal boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-learning approaches treat organ substructures independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions that don't account for geometric and spatial relationships between interconnected parts.

Method: Uses a connected template and jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy while preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth surfaces.

Result: Achieves high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance on heart, hippocampus, and lungs, even with limited or noisy training data. Better reconstructs shared interfaces and maintains structural consistency compared to voxel- and surface-based methods.

Conclusion: PrIntMesh provides a data-efficient, topology-preserving solution suitable for clinical use by treating organs as unified systems rather than independent parts.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

TL;DR: VLA-Fool is a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in Vision-Language-Action models, revealing their vulnerability to even minor multimodal perturbations that cause significant behavioral deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adversarial robustness of Vision-Language-Action models remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions, with existing studies overlooking cross-modal misalignment that affects embodied reasoning.

Method: VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: textual perturbations (gradient-based and prompt-based), visual perturbations (patch and noise distortions), and cross-modal misalignment attacks that disrupt semantic correspondence between perception and instruction.

Result: Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model show that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: Vision-Language-Action models exhibit significant vulnerability to multimodal adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for improved robustness in embodied multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICCE introduces adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling to improve unsupervised image classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance including 70.4% accuracy on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in unsupervised image classification where recent methods focus solely on clustering while bypassing representation learning, and to improve upon existing multi-head clustering approaches.

Method: Train multiple clustering heads on frozen backbone to produce diverse clusterings, then use cluster ensembling to consolidate results into consensus clustering, and finally train classifier using consensus as pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet - first unsupervised method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Conclusion: ICCE demonstrates that combining multiple clustering heads with ensemble techniques can significantly narrow the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised image classification methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

*Boyue Xu,Ruichao Hou,Tongwei Ren,Dongming Zhou,Gangshan Wu,Jinde Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwiTrack is a novel state-switching framework for cross-modal object tracking (RGB-NIR) that uses three specialized streams to handle different modalities and invalid inputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMOT methods with parallel RGB and NIR branches limit modality-specific feature extraction and fail to address object drift with unreliable inputs, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: Deploys three specialized streams: visual encoder for RGB, NIR gated adapter with visual encoder for NIR, and consistency trajectory prediction for invalid modalities. Uses dynamic template reconstruction and similarity alignment loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 7.2% precision rate and 4.3% success rate gains, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 FPS.

Conclusion: SwiTrack effectively addresses cross-modal tracking challenges by handling different modalities and unreliable inputs through specialized streams, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR/VR systems only track head and hands via HMDs and controllers, leaving full-body reconstruction incomplete. There's a need to generate realistic full-body motions from limited sensor data.

Method: Uses multi-layer perceptron backbone enhanced with residual connections and novel Memory-Block component. Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors combined with previous time instances for temporal consistency. Formulated as multi-task learning problem.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with substantial error reduction. Achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs, improving accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses incomplete full-body tracking in AR/VR by generating realistic motions from sparse inputs, achieving both high accuracy and real-time performance.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for extracting meshes from neural SDFs have limitations - sampling-based approaches introduce discretization error, while analytic methods only work with plain ReLU MLPs. There's a need for precise meshing that works with modern positional encoding schemes.

Method: Uses ReLU MLP composed with multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder.

Conclusion: TetraSDF provides an effective framework for precise analytic meshing of neural SDFs with tetrahedral positional encoding, overcoming limitations of previous methods and producing high-quality meshes without discretization artifacts.

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient 3D scene reconstruction on mobile devices for benefits like data privacy, offline operation, and faster responses by optimizing 3DGS for mobile GPU constraints.

Method: Developed a novel sorting algorithm optimized for 2D texture cache, improved variable layout design, and other optimizations specifically for mobile GPU architecture.

Result: Achieved up to 4.1× speedup for sorting, 1.7× overall speedup for 3D scene reconstruction, and reduced memory usage by up to 1.6×.

Conclusion: Texture3dgs effectively optimizes 3DGS for mobile deployment, demonstrating significant performance improvements and memory efficiency for mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: Upsample Anything is a lightweight test-time optimization framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution outputs without training, using anisotropic Gaussian kernels that combine spatial and range cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Foundation Models have strong generalization but their representations are downsampled 14x/16x, limiting pixel-level applications. Existing upsampling methods require dataset-specific retraining or heavy optimization, reducing scalability.

Method: Per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The kernel acts as a universal edge-aware operator.

Result: Runs in ≈0.419s per 224x224 image, achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Conclusion: The framework enables precise high-resolution reconstruction across architectures and modalities without training, offering fast and effective feature upsampling for diverse applications.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

TL;DR: SAEs are reinterpreted as topic models, leading to SAE-TM framework that learns reusable topic atoms for thematic analysis across text and image datasets without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role and practical value of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) by showing they can be naturally understood as topic models for embedding analysis.

Method: Extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces, derive SAE objective as MAP estimator, and develop SAE-TM framework that trains SAEs to learn topic atoms, interprets them as word distributions, and merges them into topics without retraining.

Result: SAE-TM produces more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity, and enables analysis of thematic structure in images and topic evolution over time.

Conclusion: SAEs are positioned as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across different modalities through the topic modeling perspective.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ImageNet-1K linear-probe transfer accuracy no longer reliably predicts performance on scientific imagery, explaining only 34% of variance on ecology tasks and mis-ranking 30% of models above 75% accuracy.

Method: BioBench unifies 9 publicly released ecology tasks across 4 taxonomic kingdoms and 6 acquisition modalities (drone RGB, web video, micrographs, in-situ/specimen photos, camera-trap frames) totaling 3.1M images, with a Python API for data download and lightweight classifier fitting to frozen backbones.

Result: The benchmark provides new signal for computer vision in ecology and demonstrates that ImageNet performance is an unreliable predictor for ecological applications, with evaluations taking 6 hours on an A6000 GPU for ViT-L models.

Conclusion: BioBench offers a template recipe for building reliable AI-for-science benchmarks in any domain and addresses the gap between ImageNet performance and real-world scientific application performance.

Abstract: ImageNet-1K linear-probe transfer accuracy remains the default proxy for visual representation quality, yet it no longer predicts performance on scientific imagery. Across 46 modern vision model checkpoints, ImageNet top-1 accuracy explains only 34% of variance on ecology tasks and mis-ranks 30% of models above 75% accuracy. We present BioBench, an open ecology vision benchmark that captures what ImageNet misses. BioBench unifies 9 publicly released, application-driven tasks, 4 taxonomic kingdoms, and 6 acquisition modalities (drone RGB, web video, micrographs, in-situ and specimen photos, camera-trap frames), totaling 3.1M images. A single Python API downloads data, fits lightweight classifiers to frozen backbones, and reports class-balanced macro-F1 (plus domain metrics for FishNet and FungiCLEF); ViT-L models evaluate in 6 hours on an A6000 GPU. BioBench provides new signal for computer vision in ecology and a template recipe for building reliable AI-for-science benchmarks in any domain.

TL;DR: NaTex is a native 3D texture generation framework that directly predicts texture colors in 3D space, avoiding limitations of multi-view diffusion pipelines by treating texture as a dense color point cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous MVD-based approaches including difficulties with occluded regions, mesh-texture alignment issues, and cross-view consistency problems in both content and color intensity.

Method: Proposes latent color diffusion with geometry-aware color point cloud VAE and multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), trained from scratch using 3D data. Uses native geometry control with positional embeddings and geometry latents for precise alignment, and co-designed VAE-DiT architecture with tight coupling between geometry and color branches.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Shows strong generalization capabilities for various downstream applications like material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation.

Conclusion: NaTex provides an effective native 3D texture generation solution that addresses key limitations of existing approaches and enables high-quality texture generation with precise alignment and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

*Ching-Heng Cheng,Jen-Wei Lee,Chia-Ming Lee,Chih-Chung Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WWE-UIE is an efficient underwater image enhancement network that integrates adaptive white balance, wavelet-based enhancement, and gradient-aware modules to achieve competitive restoration quality with low computational cost for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid approaches for underwater image enhancement achieve strong performance but incur high computational costs, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios on resource-limited platforms.

Method: The proposed WWE-UIE integrates three interpretable priors: adaptive white balance to correct color attenuation, wavelet-based enhancement block for multi-band decomposition capturing global structures and fine textures, and gradient-aware module using Sobel operators with learnable gating to preserve edge structures.

Result: Extensive experiments show WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE provides an efficient solution for underwater image enhancement that balances performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications while maintaining interpretability through its three core components.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChangeDINO is a Siamese framework for building change detection that combines a lightweight backbone with frozen DINOv3 features, uses a spatial-spectral transformer decoder with multi-scale differences, and includes a learnable morphology module for boundary refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning RSCD methods rely too much on change-map annotations and underuse semantic information in non-changing regions, limiting robustness to illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels.

Method: End-to-end multiscale Siamese framework with: 1) Lightweight backbone fused with frozen DINOv3 features for semantic-rich pyramids, 2) Spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder using multi-scale absolute differences as change priors, 3) Learnable morphology module for boundary refinement.

Result: Outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1 on four public benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO provides robust building change detection by effectively leveraging semantic information and multi-scale features, with demonstrated superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: ARASFSR enables arbitrary-resolution and arbitrary-scale face super-resolution using implicit representation networks with local frequency estimation and global coordinate modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations, requiring a more flexible approach.

Method: Uses 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios with implicit representation networks; includes local frequency estimation module and global coordinate modulation module.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show ARASFSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Conclusion: ARASFSR provides robust face super-resolution with arbitrary resolution and scale capabilities, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

TL;DR: Proposes a teacher-student framework with key frame selection for weakly supervised terrain classification in UAV remote sensing, achieving improved mIoU and temporal consistency using only 30% labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in UAV terrain classification including data annotation complexity, temporal consistency requirements, data scarcity, and technology range limitations that differ from ground vehicle tasks.

Method: Teacher-student architecture with key frame selection and updating algorithms for weakly supervised learning and temporal consistency knowledge distillation.

Result: Method using only 30% labeled data simultaneously improves mIoU and temporal consistency, enabling stable terrain object localization in aerial positioning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes traditional temporal consistency training deficiencies in aerial tasks through weakly supervised learning and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Motivation: Existing visual localization methods suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and dependency on fiducials or loop closure, limiting reliability for robotics and XR applications.

Method: Render synthetic views from colored LiDAR point clouds to establish 2D-3D correspondences with live frames, using neural rendering to reduce domain gap between synthetic and real images.

Result: Achieves drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in global LiDAR coordinate system, outperforms existing SLAM pipelines on ScanNet++ dataset.

Conclusion: The method provides robust real-time camera localization without drift or scale issues, with two variants (Online Render and Match, Prebuild and Localize) for different use cases.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

*Zhengxue Wang,Zhiqiang Yan,Yuan Wu,Guangwei Gao,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOMNet is an alignment-free framework for guided depth super-resolution that handles misaligned RGB-D data through multi-order matching and aggregation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RGB-D data often suffers from misalignment due to hardware limitations and calibration drift, causing performance degradation in existing methods that assume strict spatial alignment.

Method: Proposes Multi-Order Matching Network with zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to identify relevant RGB information, followed by multi-order aggregation using structure detectors for selective feature transfer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness in handling misaligned RGB-D data.

Conclusion: MOMNet effectively addresses the misalignment problem in real-world RGB-D scenarios through adaptive multi-order matching and aggregation.

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

TL;DR: DetailSemNet is a new OSV model that focuses on matching local structures between signature images rather than holistic features, achieving state-of-the-art performance through a Detail Semantics Integrator that enhances fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous OSV methods rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, which may not capture fine-grained differences needed for robust verification. Transformer-based backbones can naturally obscure local details, negatively impacting OSV performance.

Method: Proposes DetailSemNet with local structure matching and a Detail Semantics Integrator that uses feature disentanglement and re-entanglement to enhance intricate details while expanding discriminative semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results with clear margins on leading OSV benchmarks, demonstrates remarkable generalization in cross-dataset testing, and improves model interpretability.

Conclusion: The emphasis on local structure matching combined with generalizability and interpretability makes DetailSemNet highly suitable for real-world OSV applications.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

TL;DR: CAMS is a CLIP-based compositional zero-shot learning method that uses gated cross-attention and multi-space disentanglement to better separate attribute and object semantics for improved recognition of unseen compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based CZSL methods using global semantic representations have limited representational capacity and cannot fully disentangle attributes and objects, limiting generalization to unseen compositions.

Method: Uses Gated Cross-Attention to extract fine-grained semantic features from CLIP's high-level image encoding blocks while suppressing irrelevant information, followed by Multi-Space Disentanglement to separate attribute and object semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA benchmarks in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: CAMS effectively improves compositional zero-shot learning by extracting semantic features and performing disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, enabling better generalization to unseen attribute-object compositions.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional marker-based MoCap requires dense markers, leading to time-consuming setup and marker identification ambiguity, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses sparse Rigid Body Markers (RBMs) providing unambiguous 6-DoF data, with deep learning regression model estimating SMPL parameters under geodesic loss, trained on synthesized AMASS data.

Result: Matches optimization-based method performance with 10x less computation, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation, validated with real-world Vicon system data.

Conclusion: Sparse 6-DoF RBMs with manifold-aware geodesic loss provide practical, high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, VR, and biomechanics.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

TL;DR: A geometry-guided method for self-supervised surround-view depth estimation that ensures cross-view consistency by projecting 3D points onto a shared unit cylinder and using spatial attention across images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised surround-view depth estimation methods suffer from inconsistent depth estimates between overlapping images, limiting their practical utility for 360° perception.

Method: Predict initial depth maps per image, project 3D points onto shared unit cylinder to establish cross-image neighborhood relations, then apply explicit spatial attention across images based on cylinder distances to refine depth maps.

Result: The approach improves depth consistency across images and overall depth accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on DDAD and nuScenes datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-guided method successfully addresses cross-view inconsistency in surround-view depth estimation, providing dense, metric, and consistent depth maps for multi-camera systems.

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: Two segmentation models: (1) Static k-NN graph with GCNII for stable long-range information propagation, and (2) Dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator with Graph Attention Network for adaptive topology learning. Both integrate Vision Transformer feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks.

Result: 7-8% improvement in mIoU and 6% improvement in mDice scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with anatomically coherent predictions particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.

Conclusion: Graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation, improving interpretability and reliability for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

*Jin Wang,Bingfeng Zhang,Jian Pang,Mengyu Liu,Honglong Chen,Weifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LDAG, a language-driven approach for few-shot segmentation that uses LLM-generated attribute descriptions instead of support images to provide unbiased meta guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation methods rely on support images for meta guidance, but intra-class variations make this guidance inaccurate for untrained classes. The authors argue that support images may not be essential and that the key is providing unbiased meta guidance.

Method: LDAG uses Large Language Models to generate multiple detailed attribute descriptions of target classes, then employs Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) for refined visual-text guidance and Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) for cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual features.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot segmentation.

Conclusion: Language-driven attribute generalization using LLMs provides more robust and unbiased support strategy for few-shot segmentation compared to traditional support image-based approaches.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset for urban waste management that supports three tasks: waste container detection, tracking, and overflow segmentation, with improved baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing litter detection datasets lack annotations for container tracking and are captured in static environments, limiting utility for real-world logistics in smart cities.

Method: Created StreetView-Waste dataset with urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. Proposed two strategies: heuristic-based method for improved tracking and model-agnostic framework using geometric priors for litter segmentation.

Result: Fine-tuned object detectors achieved reasonable container detection performance. Proposed heuristics reduced mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Geometry-aware strategy improved segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models.

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark for real-world perception systems in urban waste management, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs and specialized approaches for this domain.

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

### [100] [VLA-Pruner: Temporal-Aware Dual-Level Visual Token Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16449)
*Ziyan Liu,Yeqiu Chen,Hongyi Cai,Tao Lin,Shuo Yang,Zheng Liu,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner is a token pruning method for Vision-Language-Action models that addresses the limitations of existing VLM-specific pruning methods by incorporating both semantic and action-level importance criteria, leveraging temporal continuity in robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token pruning methods for VLMs focus only on semantic salience, overlooking VLA's dual-system nature of high-level understanding and low-level action execution, which leads to degraded performance when critical action information is discarded.

Method: VLA-Pruner uses a dual-level importance criterion: vision-language prefill attention for semantic relevance and action decode attention (estimated via temporal smoothing) for action importance. It employs an adaptive dual-level token selection strategy to preserve tokens for both understanding and execution.

Result: VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks, demonstrating superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed VLA-Pruner successfully bridges the gap in VLA-specific token pruning by aligning with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploiting temporal continuity, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for efficient VLA deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

TL;DR: LLaVA^3 improves 3D scene understanding in vision-language models using multi-view 2D images without fine-tuning, inspired by Cubist art to represent multiple viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited 3D training data for multi-modal language models by leveraging abundant 2D datasets instead.

Method: Uses omnidirectional visual representations from multi-view 3D reconstruction to describe 3D scenes, similar to Cubist painting techniques showing multiple viewpoints.

Result: Outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively enhances 3D scene understanding capabilities without requiring 3D training data or model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

TL;DR: FastSurfer-CC is an automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry that outperforms existing tools and detects significant differences in Huntington's disease patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The corpus callosum is crucial for aging, neurological disease research, and clinical interventions, but there's a lack of comprehensive automated analysis tools.

Method: Automated pipeline that identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments corpus callosum and fornix, localizes commissures, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts shape metrics.

Result: Outperforms existing specialized tools and reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls not detected by current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: FastSurfer-CC provides an efficient, fully automated solution for corpus callosum analysis with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

*Eliyas Suleyman,Paul Henderson,Eksan Firkat,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic study on occluded video prediction, showing that incorporating point-flow and depth information improves prediction quality in occluded scenarios and background motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video prediction models struggle with occlusion, and the authors hypothesize that explicit motion (point-flow) and geometric structure (depth-maps) information can help overcome this challenge.

Method: Used a multi-object latent transformer architecture modified to incorporate depth and point-flow information, evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets using appearance metrics and Wasserstein distances on object masks.

Result: Models assisted with point flow and depth performed better in occluded scenarios and predicted more accurate background motion compared to models without these modalities.

Conclusion: Explicit motion and geometric structure information significantly improves video prediction performance in challenging occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods require large, high-quality microscope image datasets that are difficult and costly to acquire due to complex microrobot fabrication and labor-intensive labeling. Digital twin systems struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena like diffraction artifacts.

Method: Integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize microscope images efficiently. Combines physics-based simulation with deep learning for realistic image generation.

Result: Improves SSIM by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods while maintaining real-time rendering (0.022 s/frame). Pose estimator trained on synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, only 5.0%/5.4% below real-data training. Generalizes to unseen poses without additional training.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations, significantly reducing dependency on expensive real data collection while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

*Rui Wang,Yuexi Du,John Lewin,R. Todd Constable,Nicha C. Dvornek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for breast tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI that uses acquisition time information via FiLM layers to improve performance and generalization across varying protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Varying acquisition protocols and individual factors cause large appearance variations in DCE-MRI images, making automated tumor segmentation challenging despite the importance of DCE-MRI in breast cancer screening and assessment.

Method: Proposed tumor segmentation method that incorporates acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers to modulate model features according to specific acquisition sequences, allowing use of variable numbers of images per study.

Result: Evaluation on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets showed that incorporating phase acquisition time knowledge improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Leveraging acquisition time information through FiLM layers effectively addresses protocol variation challenges in DCE-MRI tumor segmentation, enhancing both performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

TL;DR: Proposes a joint framework for mapping indoor scenes and registering ceiling-mounted cameras using a mobile agent with RGB-D camera and synchronized CMC captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CMC registration is inefficient and automatic visual localization performs poorly with visual ambiguity. Need a unified solution for both scene mapping and camera registration.

Method: Uses mobile agent with head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse scene while CMCs capture the agent. Correlates trajectories via timestamps and uses factor graph optimization for joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses.

Result: Method effectively accomplishes both tasks in unified framework and jointly enhances performance. Created new benchmark dataset for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration.

Conclusion: Provides reliable tool for downstream position-aware applications by solving CMC registration and scene mapping jointly in efficient framework.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemCLIP improves CLIP's robustness to semantic transformations like paraphrasing and negation by using a new contrastive loss function and LLM-generated training triples, achieving better performance on negation benchmarks and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP models struggle with negation and paraphrasing - negation radically changes meaning with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing creates different expressions with the same meaning, posing challenges for vision-language alignment.

Method: Proposes SemCLIP with a new contrastive loss function that accounts for both paraphrasing and negation, using LLM-generated training triples of original, paraphrased, and negated captions in CLIP-like training.

Result: SemCLIP moves paraphrased captions closer to original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away. On CC-Neg benchmark, improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Shows better performance on downstream zero-shot classification tasks compared to CLIP.

Conclusion: SemCLIP achieves significant robustness to semantic transformations, particularly negation, while preserving CLIP's original performance, demonstrating improved alignment in vision-language models.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

TL;DR: A robust multi-camera tracking system for gymnastics that combines traditional triangulation with ray-plane intersection using domain knowledge to handle limited camera views and detection failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gymnast tracking faces unique challenges: limited camera installations due to space restrictions and detection failures from lighting variations, background changes, uniform differences, and occlusions, making conventional multi-camera triangulation unreliable.

Method: Proposes a cascaded data association paradigm that uses triangulation when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resorts to ray-plane intersection (based on the knowledge that gymnasts' 3D centers typically lie within predefined vertical planes) when detections are insufficient.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness through extensive experiments, showing superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios, and has been successfully applied at Gymnastics World Championships with recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Conclusion: Incorporating gymnastics domain knowledge through ray-plane intersection effectively compensates for uncertain trajectories and minimizes tracking failures, making the system practical for real-world gymnastics judging applications.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for synthetic image detection that uses contrastive learning and few-shot k-NN classification to achieve robust generalization across unseen generative models without exhaustive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting synthetic images from rapidly evolving generative AI models, where traditional detection methods requiring periodic retraining become computationally infeasible.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Vision model trained via supervised contrastive learning on subset of generators, 2) k-NN classifier in few-shot learning paradigm using limited samples from unseen generators.

Result: Achieves 91.3% average detection accuracy with only 150 images per class, outperforming existing methods by 5.2 percentage points. For source attribution, improves AUC by 14.70% and OSCR by 4.27%.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables robust, scalable forensic attribution that adapts to evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Method: Extends EOGS framework with direct operation on raw high-resolution panchromatic data, embeds bundle adjustment using optical flow during training, adds early stopping and TSDF post-processing for improved geometric accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets, improving building reconstruction MAE from 1.33 to 1.19 compared to original EOGS, while maintaining computational advantages.

Conclusion: EOGS++ demonstrates superior reconstruction quality and efficiency for satellite imagery, outperforming both original EOGS and NeRF-based methods through integrated bundle adjustment and direct raw data processing.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: VARiant reduces memory overhead in Visual Auto-Regressive models by using subnets with shared weights and progressive training, achieving significant memory savings (40-80%) and speedup (3.5x) with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progressive multi-scale generation in VAR models incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment despite their step reduction benefits.

Method: Propose VARiant with equidistant sampling to select subnets (16 to 2 layers) from original 30-layer network. Early scales use full network, later scales use subnets with shared weights. Use progressive training strategy to resolve optimization conflicts.

Result: VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95) with 40-65% memory reduction. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5x speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97).

Conclusion: VARiant's single-model architecture enables zero-cost runtime depth switching and flexible deployment from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that ultra-light models can deliver strong generalization, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning by leveraging rich 2D foundation models through point map representations.

Method: Uses point maps (3D coordinates on structured 2D grids) with view-to-scene alignment and POMA-JEPA architecture for geometrically consistent features across multiple views. Trained on ScenePoint dataset from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes.

Result: POMA-3D serves as strong backbone for diverse 3D tasks including 3D QA, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and localization using only geometric inputs (3D coordinates).

Conclusion: POMA-3D successfully explores point map approach for 3D scene understanding, effectively transferring 2D priors to 3D while overcoming data scarcity in 3D representation learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

TL;DR: Erase to Retain is a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that uses teacher-student distillation with LoRA subspace updates to selectively remove knowledge while preserving global anatomical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for selective knowledge removal in medical segmentation networks for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and dataset revision without full retraining.

Method: Teacher-student distillation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, featuring strong unlearning phase with adversarial optimization and gentle restoration phase with head-only supervised refinement.

Result: On ISIC segmentation: forget-set IoU reduced from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining performance on retain/validation (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On ISIC classification: forget accuracy decreased from 87.0% to 64.1% while retain accuracy improved from 83.9% to 90.6%.

Conclusion: LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway for responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling selective forgetting while preserving essential performance.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Motivation: Address the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection in wildfires, which limits deep neural network performance.

Method: Generate synthetic annotated smoke dataset using generative AI, apply unsupervised domain adaptation, and integrate style transfer, GANs, and image matting.

Result: Developed methods to enhance synthetic data realism and reduce domain disparity between synthetic and real-world smoke data.

Conclusion: Generative approaches enable more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models by overcoming data limitations.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, but existing iVOS models like SAM2 face challenges in surgical scenarios due to domain gap and limited long-term tracking.

Method: Proposed SAM2S with three key components: (1) DiveMem for robust long-term tracking, (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding, and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies.

Result: SAM2S achieves 80.42 average J&F, surpassing vanilla SAM2 by 17.10 points and fine-tuned SAM2 by 4.11 points, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SAM2S effectively addresses surgical iVOS challenges through specialized architectural improvements and demonstrates superior performance in both tracking accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

*Satyam Gaba*

TL;DR: This paper addresses long-tailed object detection using LVISv1 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance through enhanced Balanced Group Softmax and metric learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world object detection faces class imbalance issues where rare categories have few instances, causing detection models to be biased toward frequent classes and perform poorly on tail categories.

Method: Used two-stage Faster R-CNN with enhanced Balanced Group Softmax framework and explored metric learning with k-NN classification to create well-separated feature embeddings.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art performance with 24.5% mAP on LVISv1 dataset, surpassing previous benchmark of 24.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate class imbalance in long-tailed object detection, particularly improving performance on rare categories through better feature separation and clustering.

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

TL;DR: AGU is an efficient guided upsampling method that optimizes multiple image quality characteristics for low-light images through multi-parameter optimization and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guided image methods fail with low-light images due to high noise and low brightness, resulting in suboptimal improvements.

Method: Uses guided image method with multi-parameter optimization to learn associations between low-light and bright image characteristics from few sample image pairs.

Result: Superior to state-of-the-art methods in low-light scenarios, capable of rendering high-quality images in real time from low-quality, low-resolution input.

Conclusion: AGU effectively addresses the limitations of traditional guided methods for low-light image upscaling by learning optimal image characteristics transfer.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image.

We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes.

TL;DR: TRIM accelerates 3D Gaussian diffusion models by reducing denoising trajectories and pruning redundant Gaussian primitives, improving efficiency without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian diffusion models are slow due to massive Gaussian primitives requiring time-intensive denoising and post-processing, limiting scalability and generation speed.

Method: Proposes TRIM with temporal trimming (lightweight selector for early trajectory reduction) and spatial trimming (instance mask denoising to prune redundant background Gaussian primitives).

Result: Significantly improves both efficiency and quality of 3D generation, supporting inference-time scaling without compromising output quality.

Conclusion: TRIM provides an effective post-training approach to accelerate 3D Gaussian diffusion models through trajectory reduction and instance-aware denoising.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation framework with late-decoupled architecture and bi-branch supervision to address multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3DHS methods overlook multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization and class imbalance across multiple hierarchies, which dominate model performance on major classes.

Method: Uses a primary 3DHS branch with multiple decoders using coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance, plus an auxiliary discrimination branch with semantic prototype-based bi-branch supervision for mutual learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance on multiple datasets and backbones, with core components serving as plug-and-play enhancements for previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance problems in 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation through late-decoupled architecture and bi-branch supervision.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A teacher-guided pruning framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation with importance score estimation for one-shot global pruning, achieving high sparsity with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead of iterative train-prune-retrain cycles in unstructured pruning by developing a more efficient one-shot pruning method.

Method: Leverages gradient signals from teacher model during importance score calculation to identify critical parameters, followed by sparsity-aware retraining without reactivating pruned connections.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines like EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, achieving high compression with minimal accuracy loss across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a computation-efficient, performance-preserving pruning solution suitable for resource-constrained environments, offering superior performance to iterative methods like COLT.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critically analyzes Cambrian-S's spatial supersensing claims, showing that simple baselines can solve VSR benchmark without spatial cognition, and that Cambrian-S's methods exploit shortcuts in VSC benchmark rather than demonstrating true spatial supersensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate whether Cambrian-S's benchmarks and methods truly measure spatial supersensing capabilities in video world models, or if they can be solved through simpler approaches and shortcut exploitation.

Method: Used two approaches: (1) NoSense baseline using bag-of-words SigLIP model without temporal structure, (2) VSC-Repeat sanity check by concatenating videos with themselves to test if object-count predictions remain unchanged.

Result: NoSense achieved 95% accuracy on VSR benchmark without spatial cognition. VSC-Repeat collapsed Cambrian-S's performance from 42% to 0%, showing it relies on shortcut that rooms are never revisited rather than true spatial supersensing.

Conclusion: Current VSI-Super benchmarks don't reliably measure spatial supersensing, and Cambrian-S's methods improve performance by exploiting shortcuts rather than demonstrating robust spatial supersensing capabilities.

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

TL;DR: PartUV is a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates fewer, part-aligned charts with low distortion for challenging AI-generated meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods struggle with AI-generated meshes that are noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned, producing fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries that cause artifacts.

Method: Combines semantic part decomposition (PartField) with geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework, ensuring distortion below threshold while minimizing chart count. Integrates parameterization/packing algorithms with non-manifold mesh handling and parallelization.

Result: Outperforms existing tools and neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Conclusion: PartUV provides an effective solution for UV unwrapping challenging meshes by leveraging part-based decomposition and geometric heuristics, enabling better downstream applications.

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency.

*Eddie Pokming Sheung,Qihao Liu,Wufei Ma,Prakhar Kaushik,Jianwen Xie,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriDiff-4D is a novel diffusion-based pipeline that generates high-quality 4D avatars from text descriptions using triplane re-posing and auto-regressive generation, achieving superior temporal consistency and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing 4D generative methods including temporal/geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics.

Method: Uses diffusion-based triplane re-posing with auto-regressive strategy to generate arbitrary-length 4D sequences. First generates canonical 3D avatar and motion sequence from text, then animates avatar using second diffusion model. Learns 3D structure and motion priors from large datasets.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods, reduces generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating optimization process, improves complex motion generation with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation with excellent temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity, representing a major advancement in controllable 4D avatar generation.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

TL;DR: SceneDesigner enables accurate 9D pose control for multiple objects in image generation using a branched network, CNOCS map representation, and two-stage training with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable image generation lack comprehensive control over 9D poses (location, size, orientation) of multiple objects, suffering from limited controllability and degraded quality.

Method: Proposes SceneDesigner with branched network architecture, CNOCS map representation for 9D pose encoding, two-stage training with reinforcement learning, and Disentangled Object Sampling for inference.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality, enabling flexible multi-object 9D pose manipulation with user customization.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner provides an effective solution for comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control in image generation, addressing key limitations of existing methods through novel representations and training strategies.

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

*Junhao Cheng,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VANS is a model that uses reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model with a Video Diffusion Model for Video-Next-Event Prediction, enabling dynamic video responses instead of text answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone, and the opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction.

Method: VANS leverages reinforcement learning with Joint-GRPO to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM), optimizing VLM to produce visualization-friendly captions and VDM to generate faithful videos.

Result: VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization on procedural and predictive benchmarks.

Conclusion: The shift from telling to showing through VNEP unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration, with VANS demonstrating effective multimodal reasoning and video generation capabilities.

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

*Chenyu Lin,Cheng Chi,Jinlin Wu,Sharon Li,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualMindVLM enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes based on task difficulty, improving computational efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs pursue lengthy reasoning chains for all tasks, leading to excessive computational costs, unlike human cognitive resource allocation where simple problems get quick thinking and complex ones get deeper analysis.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Label data as fast/slow thinking based on model output length, 2) Train model using GRPO with thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking.

Result: DualMindVLM significantly outperforms base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed simple RL approach successfully enables automatic thinking mode switching in VLMs, achieving both high performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoLMM is a self-evolving framework that improves large multimodal models' reasoning capabilities through unsupervised learning using two cooperative agents (Proposer and Solver) that generate and solve image-grounded questions via internal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of human-curated data and external reward models in training large multimodal models, enabling autonomous and scalable reasoning capability improvement without annotated data or reward distillation.

Method: Uses two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer generates diverse image-grounded questions, and a Solver solves them through internal consistency, creating a continuous self-rewarding learning process.

Result: Achieves consistent gains up to ~3% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks (ChartQA, MathVista, MathVision) using only raw training images, with Qwen2.5-VL as base model.

Conclusion: EvoLMM provides a simple yet effective baseline for self-improving large multimodal models in a fully-unsupervised fashion, demonstrating the viability of autonomous reasoning capability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar reconstructs animatable 3D human avatars from single/sparse images without requiring pose inputs, overcoming limitations of pose-dependent methods that degrade with noisy pose estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on accurate ground-truth camera and human poses for reconstruction, but performance degrades significantly with noisy pose estimates, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Introduces NoPo-Avatar that reconstructs avatars solely from images without any pose input, removing dependence on test-time pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses) on THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K datasets.

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar provides a more robust and widely applicable solution for 3D human avatar reconstruction by eliminating pose dependency, making it suitable for real-world scenarios with imperfect pose estimates.

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

*George Cazenavette,Antonio Torralba,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dataset distillation method that optimizes synthetic images to match linear classifier gradients from real data when passed through pre-trained models, enabling efficient training of linear probes on large pre-trained vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on training from scratch, but modern vision approaches use pre-trained models. Need distillation methods that work with pre-trained feature extractors for linear probe training.

Method: Linear Gradient Matching - optimizes synthetic images so they produce similar gradients in linear classifiers as real data when passed through pre-trained feature extractors.

Result: Synthetic data outperforms real-image baselines, generalizes across pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP probe trained with DINO-distilled data), effective for fine-grained classification, and useful for model interpretability.

Conclusion: The method provides effective dataset distillation for pre-trained models, enabling efficient linear probe training and offering tools for analyzing model representations and sensitivities.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM limitations in digesting web content due to unfriendly formats and context length constraints by creating general-purpose summaries.

Method: Chain of Summaries (CoS) iteratively refines initial summaries through questioning to identify limitations, creating comprehensive summaries that anticipate future information needs.

Result: CoS outperforms zero-shot LLMs by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods by up to 27% on TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets, while using fewer tokens.

Conclusion: CoS provides an effective solution for making web content more accessible to LLMs while maintaining human oversight capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Motivation: Audio language models paradoxically perform better with minimal reasoning, raising questions about whether audio intelligence can truly benefit from deliberate thinking like text and vision models do.

Method: Proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework that teaches the model to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains grounded in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations.

Result: Step-Audio-R1 exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding benchmarks covering speech, environmental sounds, and music.

Conclusion: Reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when properly anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence, opening pathways for truly multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

TL;DR: JudgeBoard is a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess answer correctness without requiring answer comparisons, focusing on mathematical and science/commonsense reasoning. The MAJ framework uses multiple interacting SLMs to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) have unclear ability to judge answer correctness compared to LLMs. Existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks rely on indirect answer comparisons with predefined metrics, limiting fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs.

Method: Propose JudgeBoard pipeline for direct correctness assessment without answer comparisons. Develop MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging) framework using multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to collaboratively approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy.

Result: Significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. MAJ substantially improves SLM reliability and consistency. On MATH dataset, MAJ with smaller models performs comparably or better than larger counterparts.

Conclusion: Multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, enabling scalable and efficient assessment without relying on large models.

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

TL;DR: LLMs often fail to correctly reason with retrieved evidence, even in clinical settings with structured protocols. Using Written Exposure Therapy guidelines, the study shows persistent errors despite access to authoritative sources, proposing an evaluation framework for accuracy, consistency, and reasoning fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between retrieval and reasoning in LLMs, especially in clinical settings where outputs must align with structured protocols, ensuring safe deployment requires rigorous assessment of reasoning quality alongside retrieval.

Method: Using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed, the study evaluates model responses to clinician-vetted questions, even when authoritative passages are provided, and proposes an evaluation framework measuring accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning.

Result: Errors persist in LLM responses despite access to authoritative evidence. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Conclusion: The study highlights both the potential and risks of using LLMs in clinical settings, emphasizing that safe deployment necessitates evaluating reasoning quality with the same rigor as retrieval performance to ensure alignment with structured protocols.

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies hinders scalable research in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Supervised fine-tuning with 874K-sample cold-start dataset featuring step-by-step validation, 2) Reinforcement learning with 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to sharpen and stabilize reasoning abilities.

Result: Achieves 11.6% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance through rigorous data quality and training design.

Conclusion: The method establishes a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research, with all codes, pipeline, and data open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

TL;DR: TOFA is a training-free one-shot federated adaptation framework for Vision-Language Models that addresses communication costs and data heterogeneity without requiring additional client or server training resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high communication costs and security vulnerabilities of iterative federated learning approaches, and to address the limitations of existing one-shot methods in handling multimodal information and data heterogeneity in VLM adaptation.

Method: Uses visual and textual pipelines: hierarchical Bayesian model for personalized class prototypes in visual pipeline, and global alignment of local text prompts in textual pipeline, with adaptive weight calibration to combine both modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TOFA in handling data heterogeneity while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: TOFA provides an efficient, training-free solution for federated VLM adaptation that effectively leverages multimodal information and handles data heterogeneity without requiring additional training resources.

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

*Sen Chen,Tong Zhao,Yi Bin,Fei Ma,Wenqi Shao,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D-GARA is a dynamic benchmarking framework for evaluating Android GUI agent robustness against real-world anomalies like permission dialogs and system interruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent datasets are static and idealized, failing to capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments with anomalies, creating a gap in robust GUI agent evaluation.

Method: Proposes D-GARA framework with diverse real-world anomalies, constructs benchmark with annotated Android applications containing embedded anomalies, and conducts comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art GUI agents.

Result: Substantial performance degradation observed in GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, demonstrating the critical need for robustness-aware learning approaches.

Conclusion: D-GARA provides a modular, extensible framework for evaluating GUI agent robustness, supporting integration of new tasks and anomaly types to advance research in resilient GUI interaction systems.

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

### [144] [How Modality Shapes Perception and Reasoning: A Study of Error Propagation in ARC-AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15717)
*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Erhan Bilal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how different encoding modalities (text vs. images) affect perception and reasoning in ARC-AGI tasks, finding that structured text captures precise coordinates while images preserve 2D shapes, with combined modalities improving execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different encoding modalities shape model perception in ARC-AGI tasks and separate instruction errors from execution errors, since current systems lack principled accounts of how encodings affect perception.

Method: Used a weighted set-disagreement metric and two-stage reasoning pipeline to isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities, testing how modality affects grid feature perception.

Result: Structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes but are resolution-sensitive, and combining modalities improves execution by about 8 perception points and 0.20 median similarity.

Conclusion: Aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image modalities yields more accurate instructions and reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

*Jeremie Ochin,Raphael Chekroun,Bogdan Stanciulescu,Sotiris Manitsaris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FOOTPASS is the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting in soccer that integrates computer vision with tactical knowledge to automate reliable play-by-play data extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action recognition methods are insufficient for reliable play-by-play data extraction and typically only assist rather than fully automate annotation. There's a need to leverage tactical knowledge as prior to support computer-vision predictions for more automated and reliable play-by-play data.

Method: Introduces a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context approach that integrates outputs from computer-vision tasks (tracking, identification) with prior knowledge of soccer tactical regularities over long time horizons.

Result: FOOTPASS enables development of player-centric action spotting methods that generate reliable play-by-play data streams essential for sports analytics.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a benchmark for holistic action spotting that combines computer vision with tactical knowledge, enabling more automated extraction of structured play-by-play data for soccer analytics.

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based query reformulation research lacks unified toolkits, hindering fair comparison, rapid experimentation, consistent benchmarking, and reliable deployment of different methods.

Method: Developed a lightweight, extensible Python toolkit with: Python API for diverse LLM methods, retrieval-agnostic interface, centralized prompt management with versioning, built-in benchmark support, and open-source implementation.

Result: QueryGym successfully provides a unified framework that enables researchers to implement, execute, and compare LLM-based query reformulation methods consistently across different backends and benchmarks.

Conclusion: QueryGym addresses the critical gap in LLM-based query reformulation research by offering a comprehensive, open-source toolkit that facilitates fair comparisons and accelerates experimentation in this important area.

Abstract: We present QueryGym, a lightweight, extensible Python toolkit that supports large language model (LLM)-based query reformulation. This is an important tool development since recent work on llm-based query reformulation has shown notable increase in retrieval effectiveness. However, while different authors have sporadically shared the implementation of their methods, there is no unified toolkit that provides a consistent implementation of such methods, which hinders fair comparison, rapid experimentation, consistent benchmarking and reliable deployment. QueryGym addresses this gap by providing a unified framework for implementing, executing, and comparing llm-based reformulation methods. The toolkit offers: (1) a Python API for applying diverse LLM-based methods, (2) a retrieval-agnostic interface supporting integration with backends such as Pyserini and PyTerrier, (3) a centralized prompt management system with versioning and metadata tracking, (4) built-in support for benchmarks like BEIR and MS MARCO, and (5) a completely open-source extensible implementation available to all researchers.

*Elena V. Epure,Yashar Deldjoo,Bruno Sguerra,Markus Schedl,Manuel Moussallam*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLMs disrupt traditional music recommender system evaluation by introducing generative capabilities, new challenges like hallucinations, and opportunities for natural-language interaction, requiring a fundamental rethinking of evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MRS evaluation focused on retrieval accuracy is inadequate for LLM-driven systems due to their generative nature, new challenges, and opportunities, necessitating updated evaluation approaches.

Method: Review how LLMs reshape music recommendation components, examine NLP evaluation practices, and synthesize insights to outline structured success and risk dimensions for LLM-based MRS evaluation.

Result: Provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM-driven music recommender systems, addressing both opportunities (natural-language interaction) and challenges (hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs).

Conclusion: The shift to LLM-driven MRS requires cross-disciplinary evaluation perspectives that go beyond traditional accuracy metrics to encompass generative capabilities, risks, and new interaction paradigms.

Abstract: Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators.
  This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music. We then examine evaluation practices from NLP, highlighting methodologies and open challenges relevant to MRS. Finally, we synthesize insights-focusing on how LLM prompting applies to MRS, to outline a structured set of success and risk dimensions. Our goal is to provide the MRS community with an updated, pedagogical, and cross-disciplinary perspective on evaluation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Prism is a decoupled framework that separates recommendation ranking from explanation generation, using knowledge distillation to create efficient student models that outperform larger teacher models in explanation quality while being much faster and more memory-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end LLM-based recommendation systems where joint optimization of ranking and explanation leads to suboptimal compromises.

Method: A decoupled framework with separate ranking and explanation stages, using a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce explanatory knowledge, and a compact fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base) to synthesize personalized explanations.

Result: The 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving 24x speedup and 10x memory reduction during inference.

Conclusion: Decoupling recommendation components with targeted distillation provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage.
  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.
  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.

Our evaluation confirms that AccelOpt's capability improves over time, boosting the average percentage of peak throughput from $49\%$ to $61\%$ on Trainium 1 and from $45\%$ to $59\%$ on Trainium 2 for NKIBench kernels. Moreover, AccelOpt is highly cost-effective: using open-source models, it matches the kernel improvements of Claude Sonnet 4 while being $26\times$ cheaper.

TL;DR: UniUltra adapts SAM2 for universal ultrasound segmentation using parameter-efficient fine-tuning and knowledge distillation, achieving competitive performance with 94.08% fewer parameters than SAM2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 performs poorly on ultrasound images due to domain disparities, requiring efficient adaptation for clinical use while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Method: Proposes context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) for fine-grained perception and deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) to compress the model for clinical deployment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with superior generalization, using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning and achieving 94.08% parameter reduction in final compressed model.

Conclusion: UniUltra enables efficient SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound segmentation, making it suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrates remarkable universal segmentation capabilities on natural images. However, its performance on ultrasound images is significantly degraded due to domain disparities. This limitation raises two critical challenges: how to efficiently adapt SAM2 to ultrasound imaging while maintaining parameter efficiency, and how to deploy the adapted model effectively in resource-constrained clinical environments. To address these issues, we propose UniUltra for universal ultrasound segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) that enhances fine-grained perception across diverse ultrasound imaging modalities while achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To further improve clinical applicability, we develop a deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) technique that transfers knowledge from the large image encoder of the fine-tuned SAM2 to a super lightweight encoder, substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-arts with superior generalization capabilities. Notably, our framework achieves competitive performance using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning, and the final compressed model reduces the parameter count by 94.08% compared to the original SAM2, making it highly suitable for practical clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the spatial organization of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates in Parkinson's disease through automated analysis of immunohistochemistry images.

Method: Developed an automated image processing pipeline using weakly supervised segmentation robust to immunohistochemical labeling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier to differentiate aggregate morphologies.

Result: Achieved 80% balanced accuracy in differentiating between major aggregate morphologies including Lewy bodies and neurites.

Conclusion: The framework enables large-scale characterization of alpha-synuclein aggregate spatial distribution and heterogeneity, and investigation of their relationships with surrounding cells.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.

TL;DR: A framework for simulating uncooperative behaviors in LLM-based multi-agent systems, showing that any uncooperative behavior can cause rapid system collapse within 1-7 rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how uncooperative behaviors destabilize LLM-based multi-agent systems and develop tools to analyze system resilience.

Method: Game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative behaviors combined with a multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines behaviors as agent states evolve.

Result: 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors; cooperative agents maintain 100% system stability while uncooperative agents cause collapse within 1-7 rounds with significant resource overuse.

Conclusion: Uncooperative agents significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the critical need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and analyzing how uncooperative behaviors can destabilize or collapse LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.

*Diaeddin Rimawi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents GResilience framework for balancing resilience and energy efficiency in Online Collaborative AI Systems (OL-CAIS) during disruptions, using multi-objective optimization, game theory, and reinforcement learning to enable green recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OL-CAIS systems are vulnerable to disruptions that degrade performance, creating a trade-off between restoring resilience and maintaining energy efficiency (greenness). Decision-makers need methods to balance these competing objectives.

Method: Modeled OL-CAIS through three operational states (steady, disruptive, final). Developed GResilience framework with three recovery strategies: multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). Used collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations for evaluation.

Result: Resilience model successfully captured performance transitions during disruptions. GResilience policies improved green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent achieved strongest results with marginal CO2 increase. Containerization reduced CO2 emissions by half. Observed catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions.

Conclusion: The research provides effective models, metrics, and policies for ensuring green recovery in OL-CAIS, with RL-based approaches showing the best performance despite slight energy trade-offs. Containerization offers significant energy savings.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.

TL;DR: A novel framework for hardening system prompts in LLMs using shield appending to protect against extraction attacks while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System prompts contain sensitive/proprietary information vulnerable to extraction attacks via adversarial queries, with existing defenses being heuristic-based, computationally expensive, or incompatible with black-box APIs.

Method: Formalizes prompt hardening as utility-constrained optimization problem using LLM-as-optimizer to search for protective SHIELDs that minimize leakage while maintaining task utility above threshold.

Result: Optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against comprehensive extraction attacks, outperforming baseline defenses without compromising model functionality.

Conclusion: Presents a practical, lightweight paradigm for robust, utility-aware LLM security defenses that works with black-box API access.

Abstract: System prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they often contain proprietary logic or sensitive information, making them a prime target for extraction attacks. Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

Abstract: We open-source MiMo-Embodied, the first cross-embodied foundation model to successfully integrate and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both Autonomous Driving and Embodied AI. MiMo-Embodied sets new records across 17 embodied AI benchmarks in Task Planning, Affordance Prediction and Spatial Understanding, while also excelling in 12 autonomous driving benchmarks across Environmental Perception, Status Prediction, and Driving Planning. Across these tasks, MiMo-Embodied significantly outperforms existing open-source, closed-source, and specialized baselines. Our results indicate that through multi-stage learning, curated data construction, and CoT/RL fine-tuning, these two domains exhibit strong positive transfer and mutually reinforce one another. We provide a detailed analysis of our model design and training methodologies to facilitate further research. Code and models are available at https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Embodied.

TL;DR: Robots use peering motion to create synthetic aperture sensing, blurring occlusions and focusing on background objects for better scene understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome partial occlusion in robotic vision by mimicking animal peering behavior to estimate distance through motion parallax.

Method: Robot executes peering motion to create wide synthetic aperture, then computationally integrates captured images to synthesize images with shallow depth of field.

Result: Effectively blurs occluding elements while bringing background into sharp focus, enabling real-time high-resolution perception across spectral bands.

Conclusion: Peering motion for synthetic aperture sensing is a robust, computationally efficient solution for advanced scene understanding in cluttered environments.

Abstract: Peering, a side-to-side motion used by animals to estimate distance through motion parallax, offers a powerful bio-inspired strategy to overcome a fundamental limitation in robotic vision: partial occlusion. Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.
