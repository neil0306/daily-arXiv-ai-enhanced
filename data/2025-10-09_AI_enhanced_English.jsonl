To\naddress this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a\ncontinuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and\nunderstanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional\nfeatures, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile\nthese competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture\ninvolving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.\nBuilt on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual\nrepresentations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single\nautoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and\ngeneration as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly\nsupports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,\ngeneration and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous\nvisual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers\nby the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art\nlevel performance across both domains.
