### [2] [Knowledge Graph-Guided Multi-Agent Distillation for Reliable Industrial Question Answering with Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06240)
*Jiqun Pan,Zhenke Duan,Jiani Tu,Anzhi Cheng,Yanqing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-MASD is a distillation method that transfers multi-agent reasoning capabilities to lightweight models using knowledge graphs as verifiable priors, achieving improved accuracy and reliability for industrial QA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial QA systems require higher safety and reliability than general dialogue models, but existing multi-agent LLMs suffer from uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, while conventional distillation methods cannot effectively transfer collaborative reasoning to deployable student models.

Method: Formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates knowledge graphs as verifiable structured priors to enrich state representation and ensure convergence. Integrates collaborative reasoning with knowledge grounding to generate high-confidence instruction-tuning data.

Result: Experiments on industrial QA dataset show KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4% to 20.1% over baselines and significantly enhances reliability for safety-critical deployment.

Conclusion: KG-MASD enables trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios by jointly distilling reasoning depth and verifiability into compact student models suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Industrial question-answering (QA) systems require higher safety and
reliability than general-purpose dialogue models, as errors in high-risk
scenarios such as equipment fault diagnosis can have severe consequences.
Although multi-agent large language models enhance reasoning depth, they suffer
from uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, and conventional
distillation methods struggle to transfer collaborative reasoning capabilities
to lightweight, deployable student models. To address these challenges, we
propose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our
approach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates
a knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state
representation and ensure convergence. By integrating collaborative reasoning
with knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning
data and jointly distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact
student models suitable for edge deployment. Experiments on an industrial QA
dataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4 per cent to 20.1 per cent
over baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI
deployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/erwinmsmith/KG-MAD/.

### [3] [Transparent Reference-free Automated Evaluation of Open-Ended User Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06242)
*Subin An,Yugyeong Ji,Junyoung Kim,Heejin Kook,Yang Lu,Josh Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for evaluating human-written survey responses using gibberish filtering and LLM-based assessment of effort, relevance, and completeness dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic evaluation methods target LLM-generated text and inadequately assess human-written survey responses, which have distinct characteristics and require effective evaluation to avoid misleading conclusions.

Method: Two-stage evaluation framework: 1) gibberish filtering to remove nonsensical responses, 2) LLM-based assessment across three dimensions (effort, relevance, completeness) grounded in empirical analysis of real-world survey data.

Result: Outperforms existing metrics on English and Korean datasets, demonstrates high practical applicability for response quality prediction and rejection, and shows strong correlations with expert assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the unique characteristics of human survey responses and provides a practical solution for real-world applications in marketing research.

Abstract: Open-ended survey responses provide valuable insights in marketing research,
but low-quality responses not only burden researchers with manual filtering but
also risk leading to misleading conclusions, underscoring the need for
effective evaluation. Existing automatic evaluation methods target
LLM-generated text and inadequately assess human-written responses with their
distinct characteristics. To address such characteristics, we propose a
two-stage evaluation framework specifically designed for human survey
responses. First, gibberish filtering removes nonsensical responses. Then,
three dimensions-effort, relevance, and completeness-are evaluated using LLM
capabilities, grounded in empirical analysis of real-world survey data.
Validation on English and Korean datasets shows that our framework not only
outperforms existing metrics but also demonstrates high practical applicability
for real-world applications such as response quality prediction and response
rejection, showing strong correlations with expert assessment.

### [4] [CoT Referring: Improving Referring Expression Tasks with Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06243)
*Qihua Dong,Luis Figueroa,Handong Zhao,Kushal Kafle,Jason Kuen,Zhihong Ding,Scott Cohen,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT Referring improves multimodal reasoning by restructuring training data into chain-of-thought steps for better referring expression comprehension and segmentation, achieving 2.5%+ gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multimodal language models' capabilities in complex referring expression tasks by improving cross-modal reasoning through structured training data.

Method: Proposes CoT Referring strategy that parses textual structures into sequential referring steps, restructures training data with new annotations, integrates detection/segmentation into unified MLLM framework, and uses adaptive weighted loss.

Result: Achieves 2.5%+ improvement over baseline models on curated benchmark and RefCOCO/+/g datasets.

Conclusion: The CoT Referring approach effectively enhances multimodal reasoning for complex referring tasks through structured training data and unified framework integration.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are critical tasks for
assessing the integration of language understanding and image comprehension,
serving as benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy, CoT
Referring, which enhances model reasoning across modalities through a
structured, chain-of-thought training data structure. Our approach
systematically parses textual structures to a sequential referring step, where
in each step it identifies relationships and ensures consistent reference
alignment, thereby improving accuracy in complex query scenarios. We
restructure the training data to enforce a new output form, providing new
annotations for existing datasets and compiling an evaluation benchmark from
existing resources. This benchmark is designed explicitly for complex referring
cases. We also integrate detection and segmentation capabilities into a unified
MLLM framework, training it with a novel adaptive weighted loss to optimize
performance. Experimental results on our curated benchmark and RefCOCO/+/g
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a notable increase of 2.5%+
over baseline models.

### [5] [Evaluating Embedding Frameworks for Scientific Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06244)
*Nouman Ahmed,Ronin Wu,Victor Botev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on finding optimal word representation and tokenization methods for scientific domain NLP, and building a comprehensive evaluation suite to test various algorithms in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific data requires optimal word representation since words can have different meanings depending on context. While transformers generate good contextual embeddings, they are computationally expensive to pre-train from scratch, especially for scientific domains.

Method: Built an evaluation suite with multiple downstream tasks and relevant datasets for scientific domain NLP. Used this suite to test various word representation and tokenization algorithms.

Result: The research successfully created a comprehensive evaluation framework and tested different word representation and tokenization methods specifically for scientific domain applications.

Conclusion: The work provides both optimal word representation/tokenization methods for scientific NLP tasks and a reusable evaluation suite that can assess future algorithms in this domain.

Abstract: Finding an optimal word representation algorithm is particularly important in
terms of domain specific data, as the same word can have different meanings and
hence, different representations depending on the domain and context. While
Generative AI and transformer architecture does a great job at generating
contextualized embeddings for any given work, they are quite time and compute
extensive, especially if we were to pre-train such a model from scratch. In
this work, we focus on the scientific domain and finding the optimal word
representation algorithm along with the tokenization method that could be used
to represent words in the scientific domain. The goal of this research is two
fold: 1) finding the optimal word representation and tokenization methods that
can be used in downstream scientific domain NLP tasks, and 2) building a
comprehensive evaluation suite that could be used to evaluate various word
representation and tokenization algorithms (even as new ones are introduced) in
the scientific domain. To this end, we build an evaluation suite consisting of
several downstream tasks and relevant datasets for each task. Furthermore, we
use the constructed evaluation suite to test various word representation and
tokenization algorithms.

### [6] [TRepLiNa: Layer-wise CKA+REPINA Alignment Improves Low-Resource Machine Translation in Aya-23 8B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06249)
*Toshiki Nakai,Ravi Kiran Chikkala,Lena Sophie Oberkircher,Nicholas Jennings,Natalia Skachkova,Tatiana Anikina,Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRepLiNa method combines CKA and REPINA to improve low-resource language translation by enforcing cross-lingual similarity in mid-level layers of multilingual LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses India's linguistic gaps by improving translation quality from low-resource languages (LRLs) to high-resource languages (HRLs) using limited resources.

Method: Combines Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) for cross-lingual representation alignment with REPINA regularization, applied to Aya-23 8B model with QLoRA in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.

Result: TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) effectively improves LRL translation, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, by aligning mid-level layers.

Conclusion: Aligning mid-level layers using TRepLiNa is a practical, low-cost approach for enhancing low-resource language translation.

Abstract: The 2025 Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact
(MMLoSo) Language Challenge addresses one of India's most pressing linguistic
gaps: the lack of resources for its diverse low-resource languages (LRLs). In
this study, we investigate whether enforcing cross-lingual similarity in
specific internal layers of a decoder-only multilingual large language model
(LLM) can improve translation quality from LRL to high-resource language (HRL).
Specifically, we combine Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity metric
that encourages representations of different languages to align, with REPINA, a
regularization method that constrains parameter updates to remain close to the
pretrained model, into a joint method we call TRepLiNa. In this research
project, we experiment with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using
Aya-23 8B with QLoRA across MMLoSo shared task language pairs (Mundari,
Santali, Bhili) with Hindi/English pivots. Our results show that aligning
mid-level layers using TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) is a low-cost, practical approach
to improving LRL translation, especially in data-scarce settings.

Method: Phased human-in-the-loop annotation methodology combining linguistic expertise with quality assurance, using inter-annotator agreement metrics and root-cause analysis to resolve inconsistencies.

Result: Substantial improvements in recall and false positive rates across pilot, training, and production phases, creating high-fidelity datasets for supervised LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Iterative, analytics-driven pipelines enhance both annotation quality and downstream model reliability, addressing common annotator challenges in multilingual PII labeling.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption, ensuring their reliable
handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across diverse regulatory
contexts has become essential. This work introduces a scalable multilingual
data curation framework designed for high-quality PII annotation across 13
underrepresented locales, covering approximately 336 locale-specific PII types.
Our phased, human-in-the-loop annotation methodology combines linguistic
expertise with rigorous quality assurance, leading to substantial improvements
in recall and false positive rates from pilot, training, and production phases.
By leveraging inter-annotator agreement metrics and root-cause analysis, the
framework systematically uncovers and resolves annotation inconsistencies,
resulting in high-fidelity datasets suitable for supervised LLM fine-tuning.
Beyond reporting empirical gains, we highlight common annotator challenges in
multilingual PII labeling and demonstrate how iterative, analytics-driven
pipelines can enhance both annotation quality and downstream model reliability.

### [9] [Dual-stage and Lightweight Patient Chart Summarization for Emergency Physicians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06263)
*Jiajun Wu,Swaleh Zaidi,Braden Teitge,Henry Leung,Jiayu Zhou,Jessalyn Holodinsky,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage offline EHR summarization system using dual Jetson Nano devices for retrieval and generation, producing structured summaries in under 30 seconds while preserving patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency physicians are overwhelmed by extensive unstructured clinical data in EHRs, needing quick access to critical information while maintaining patient privacy through offline processing.

Method: Dual-device architecture with Jetson Nano-R for retrieval (splitting EHRs into sections and searching) and Jetson Nano-S for generation (using small language models under 7B parameters), connected via lightweight socket link.

Result: Preliminary results on MIMIC-IV and real EHRs show the system can produce useful summaries in under 30 seconds, with evaluation using LLM-as-Judge for factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity.

Conclusion: The fully offline system effectively enables clinical summarization on embedded devices, addressing privacy concerns while providing timely access to critical patient information.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain extensive unstructured clinical data
that can overwhelm emergency physicians trying to identify critical
information. We present a two-stage summarization system that runs entirely on
embedded devices, enabling offline clinical summarization while preserving
patient privacy. In our approach, a dual-device architecture first retrieves
relevant patient record sections using the Jetson Nano-R (Retrieve), then
generates a structured summary on another Jetson Nano-S (Summarize),
communicating via a lightweight socket link. The summarization output is
two-fold: (1) a fixed-format list of critical findings, and (2) a
context-specific narrative focused on the clinician's query. The retrieval
stage uses locally stored EHRs, splits long notes into semantically coherent
sections, and searches for the most relevant sections per query. The generation
stage uses a locally hosted small language model (SLM) to produce the summary
from the retrieved text, operating within the constraints of two NVIDIA Jetson
devices. We first benchmarked six open-source SLMs under 7B parameters to
identify viable models. We incorporated an LLM-as-Judge evaluation mechanism to
assess summary quality in terms of factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
Preliminary results on MIMIC-IV and de-identified real EHRs demonstrate that
our fully offline system can effectively produce useful summaries in under 30
seconds.

### [10] [A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language Models: Causes, Detection, and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06265)
*Aisha Alansari,Hamzah Luqman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive review of hallucination in large language models (LLMs), covering causes, detection methods, and mitigation strategies to address the problem of LLMs generating fluent but factually inaccurate information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs achieve remarkable performance but often produce false or fabricated information (hallucinations), which undermines their reliability and trustworthiness, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy.

Method: The survey presents taxonomies of hallucination types and analyzes root causes across the entire LLM development lifecycle. It examines detection approaches and mitigation strategies, and reviews evaluation benchmarks and metrics.

Result: The paper provides a structured framework for understanding LLM hallucinations, including comprehensive taxonomies of types, causes, detection methods, and mitigation strategies, along with analysis of current approaches' strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: The survey outlines key open challenges and promising directions for future research to develop more truthful and trustworthy LLMs, establishing a foundation for addressing the hallucination problem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, their
impressive fluency often comes at the cost of producing false or fabricated
information, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Hallucination refers to the
generation of content by an LLM that is fluent and syntactically correct but
factually inaccurate or unsupported by external evidence. Hallucinations
undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs, especially in domains
requiring factual accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive review of
research on hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on causes, detection, and
mitigation. We first present a taxonomy of hallucination types and analyze
their root causes across the entire LLM development lifecycle, from data
collection and architecture design to inference. We further examine how
hallucinations emerge in key natural language generation tasks. Building on
this foundation, we introduce a structured taxonomy of detection approaches and
another taxonomy of mitigation strategies. We also analyze the strengths and
limitations of current detection and mitigation approaches and review existing
evaluation benchmarks and metrics used to quantify LLMs hallucinations.
Finally, we outline key open challenges and promising directions for future
research, providing a foundation for the development of more truthful and
trustworthy LLMs.

*Rohitash Chandra,Yathin Suresh,Divyansh Raj Sinha,Sanchit Jindal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deep learning analysis of Billboard Chart songs over 70 years shows significant increase in explicit content since 1990, with rising prevalence of profane and sexually explicit lyrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's been a drastic increase in abusive and sexually explicit content in popular music, but lack of studies to validate this trend for effective policy development, especially given harmful behavioral changes in children and youths.

Method: Utilized deep learning methods and language models to analyze songs from Billboard Charts over seven decades, conducting longitudinal study with sentiment analysis and abuse detection including sexually explicit content.

Result: Significant rise in explicit content in popular music from 1990 onwards, with increasing prevalence of songs containing profane, sexually explicit, and otherwise inappropriate language.

Conclusion: Language models effectively capture nuanced patterns in lyrical content that reflect shifts in societal norms and language use over time.

Abstract: There is no doubt that there has been a drastic increase in abusive and
sexually explicit content in music, particularly in Billboard Music Charts.
However, there is a lack of studies that validate the trend for effective
policy development, as such content has harmful behavioural changes in children
and youths. In this study, we utilise deep learning methods to analyse songs
(lyrics) from Billboard Charts of the United States in the last seven decades.
We provide a longitudinal study using deep learning and language models and
review the evolution of content using sentiment analysis and abuse detection,
including sexually explicit content. Our results show a significant rise in
explicit content in popular music from 1990 onwards. Furthermore, we find an
increasing prevalence of songs with lyrics containing profane, sexually
explicit, and otherwise inappropriate language. The longitudinal analysis of
the ability of language models to capture nuanced patterns in lyrical content,
reflecting shifts in societal norms and language use over time.

### [12] [Reproducibility Study of "XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06275)
*Ranjan Mishra,Julian I. Bibo,Quinten van Engelen,Henk Schaapman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reproduces and extends the XRec framework for explainable recommendations using LLMs, testing with Llama 3 instead of GPT-3.5-turbo and modifying the Mixture of Experts embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate the results of the original XRec paper and extend it by using a different LLM (Llama 3) and modifying the Mixture of Experts module embeddings.

Method: Built on the original XRec source code, used Llama 3 for evaluation, and modified input/output embeddings of the Mixture of Experts module to analyze their impact.

Result: XRec effectively generates personalized explanations and stability improves with collaborative information, but doesn't consistently outperform all baselines. Mixture of Experts embeddings significantly shape explanation structures.

Conclusion: The reproduction validates XRec's effectiveness while highlighting the importance of MoE embeddings. Provides open-source implementation to enhance accessibility for researchers.

Abstract: In this study, we reproduced the work done in the paper "XRec: Large Language
Models for Explainable Recommendation" by Ma et al. (2024). The original
authors introduced XRec, a model-agnostic collaborative instruction-tuning
framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to provide users with
comprehensive explanations of generated recommendations. Our objective was to
replicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM
for evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided
by Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by
modifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's
Mixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates
personalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating
collaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all
baseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the
importance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation
structures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language
modeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation
that enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike. Our
complete code repository can be found at

*Robin Kokot,Wessel Poelman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how multilingual transformer models represent morphosyntactic properties of questions using a new dataset (QTC) across seven languages, comparing neural probes against statistical baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multilingual transformer models capture morphosyntactic properties of questions and evaluate when contextual representations outperform statistical baselines.

Method: Created QTC dataset with question type and complexity annotations; used layer-wise probing on frozen Glot500-m representations with selectivity controls; compared against subword TF-IDF baselines and fine-tuned models.

Result: Statistical features effectively classify questions in languages with explicit marking, while neural probes better capture fine-grained structural complexity patterns.

Conclusion: Contextual representations excel at capturing structural complexity, and the study evaluates when they outperform statistical baselines and how parameter updates affect pre-trained linguistic information availability.

Abstract: This work investigates how a multilingual transformer model represents
morphosyntactic properties of questions. We introduce the Question Type and
Complexity (QTC) dataset with sentences across seven languages, annotated with
type information and complexity metrics including dependency length, tree
depth, and lexical density. Our evaluation extends probing methods to
regression labels with selectivity controls to quantify gains in
generalizability. We compare layer-wise probes on frozen Glot500-m (Imani et
al., 2023) representations against subword TF-IDF baselines, and a fine-tuned
model. Results show that statistical features classify questions effectively in
languages with explicit marking, while neural probes capture fine-grained
structural complexity patterns better. We use these results to evaluate when
contextual representations outperform statistical baselines and whether
parameter updates reduce the availability of pre-trained linguistic
information.

### [14] [LLM Bias Detection and Mitigation through the Lens of Desired Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06354)
*Ingroj Shrestha,Padmini Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weighted adaptive loss fine-tuning method to align LLM gender-profession outputs with desired distributions (either equal or real-world), achieving significant bias reduction while preserving language modeling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior bias mitigation work focused on social equality, but less attention was given to aligning LLM outputs with desired distributions (either equal or real-world) to support factual grounding.

Method: A weighted adaptive loss based fine-tuning method that aligns LLM's gender-profession output distribution with desired distributions, using profession sets derived from U.S. labor statistics (2024).

Result: Achieved near-complete bias mitigation under equality settings and 30-75% reduction under real-world settings. Autoregressive LLMs showed no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with Llama Instruct models achieving 50-62% reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces bias in LLM outputs by aligning them with desired distributions while maintaining language modeling performance, demonstrating the importance of distribution-aware bias mitigation approaches.

Abstract: Although prior work on bias mitigation has focused on promoting social
equality and demographic parity, less attention has been given to aligning
LLM's outputs to desired distributions. For example, we might want to align a
model with real-world distributions to support factual grounding. Thus, we
define bias as deviation from a desired distribution, which may be an equal or
real-world distribution, depending on application goals. We propose a weighted
adaptive loss based fine-tuning method that aligns LLM's gender-profession
output distribution with the desired distribution, while preserving language
modeling capability. Using 3 profession sets -- male-dominated,
female-dominated, and gender-balanced -- derived from U.S. labor statistics
(2024), we assess both our adaptive method for reflecting reality and a
non-adaptive variant for equality. Across three masked language models, bias is
observed under both distributions. We achieve near-complete mitigation under
equality and 30-75% reduction under real-world settings. Autoregressive LLMs
show no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with
the Llama Instruct models (3.2-3B, 3.1-8B) achieving a 50-62% reduction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVALUESTEER is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' and reward models' ability to align with diverse user value and style preferences, showing current models struggle with complex preference profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for pluralistic AI systems that accommodate diverse global user preferences and values, and fill the gap in existing datasets for controlled evaluation of reward model steering.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset of 165,888 preference pairs systematically varying 4 value dimensions (traditional, secular-rational, survival, self-expression) and 4 style dimensions (verbosity, readability, confidence, warmth), then evaluated models on their ability to select preference-aligned responses.

Result: Best models achieved <75% accuracy with full user profiles vs >99% accuracy when only relevant preferences were provided, highlighting limitations in identifying and adapting to relevant user information.

Conclusion: Current reward models have significant limitations in steering towards diverse human values and preferences, and EVALUESTEER provides a challenging testbed for developing more adaptable models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, creating pluralistic
systems that can accommodate the diverse preferences and values of users
worldwide becomes essential. We introduce EVALUESTEER, a benchmark to measure
LLMs' and reward models' (RMs) steerability towards users' value and stylistic
preference profiles grounded in psychology and human-LLM interaction
literature. To address the gap in existing datasets that do not support
controlled evaluations of RM steering, we synthetically generated 165,888
preference pairs -- systematically varying pairs along 4 value dimensions
(traditional, secular-rational, survival, and self-expression) and 4 style
dimensions (verbosity, readability, confidence, and warmth). We use EVALUESTEER
to evaluate whether, given a user profile and a pair of candidate value-laden
and style-laden responses, LLMs and RMs are able to select the output that
aligns with the user's preferences. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary
LLMs and RMs under sixteen systematic prompting conditions and six preference
comparison scenarios. Notably, our results show that, when given the user's
full profile of values and stylistic preferences, the best models achieve <75%
accuracy at choosing the correct response, in contrast to >99% accuracy when
only relevant style and value preferences are provided. EVALUESTEER thus
highlights the limitations of current RMs at identifying and adapting to
relevant user profile information, and provides a challenging testbed for
developing RMs that can be steered towards diverse human values and
preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EverydayMMQA framework and OASIS dataset to address cultural and linguistic gaps in multimodal AI, focusing on everyday knowledge in underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models fail on culturally grounded queries, especially in low-resource languages. There's a need for datasets that reflect diverse cultural contexts and everyday situations.

Method: Created EverydayMMQA framework to build culturally-grounded datasets. Developed OASIS dataset with 0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs covering speech, images, and text across English and Arabic varieties from 18 countries.

Result: OASIS enables testing on pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware reasoning. Benchmarked 8 models (4 closed-source, 3 open-source, 1 fine-tuned) showing the dataset's utility for evaluating multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: EverydayMMQA and OASIS provide essential benchmarks and training data for developing multimodal LLMs that can handle everyday tasks within diverse cultural contexts, addressing current limitations in cultural awareness.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal models achieve strong results on tasks like Visual
Question Answering (VQA), but they often fail when queries require culturally
grounded, everyday knowledge, particularly in low-resource and underrepresented
languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce Everyday Multimodal and
Multilingual QA (EverydayMMQA), a framework for creating large-scale,
culturally-grounded datasets for spoken and visual question answering (SVQA).
Using this framework, we developed OASIS, a multimodal dataset integrating
speech, images, and text. With over ~0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs, OASIS
contains 3.7M spoken questions, enabling four unique input combinations:
speech-only, text-only, speech+image, and text+image. Focused on English and
Arabic varieties, 18 countries, the dataset content is curated to reflect
diverse, real-world situations. OASIS tests models on tasks beyond object
recognition that involve pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware
reasoning. We benchmarked four closed-source models, three open-source models,
and one fine-tuned model. EverydayMMQA and OASIS together provide a benchmark
and training dataset for building multimodal LLMs for a comprehensive set of
everyday tasks within cultural contexts. The framework and dataset will be made
publicly available to the community.

### [17] [Semantic Regexes: Auto-Interpreting LLM Features with a Structured Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06378)
*Angie Boggust,Donghao Ren,Yannick Assogba,Dominik Moritz,Arvind Satyanarayan,Fred Hohman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic regexes as structured language descriptions for LLM features to address the vagueness and inconsistency of natural language descriptions in automated interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language feature descriptions in automated interpretability are often vague, inconsistent, and require manual relabeling, creating a need for more precise and structured alternatives.

Method: Semantic regexes combine primitives that capture linguistic and semantic feature patterns with modifiers for contextualization, composition, and quantification to create precise and expressive feature descriptions.

Result: Semantic regexes match the accuracy of natural language while yielding more concise and consistent feature descriptions, enable new types of analyses like quantifying feature complexity across layers, and help people build accurate mental models of LLM feature activations.

Conclusion: Semantic regexes provide a structured approach to automated interpretability that improves precision, consistency, and enables scalable analysis from individual features to model-wide patterns.

Abstract: Automated interpretability aims to translate large language model (LLM)
features into human understandable descriptions. However, these natural
language feature descriptions are often vague, inconsistent, and require manual
relabeling. In response, we introduce semantic regexes, structured language
descriptions of LLM features. By combining primitives that capture linguistic
and semantic feature patterns with modifiers for contextualization,
composition, and quantification, semantic regexes produce precise and
expressive feature descriptions. Across quantitative benchmarks and qualitative
analyses, we find that semantic regexes match the accuracy of natural language
while yielding more concise and consistent feature descriptions. Moreover,
their inherent structure affords new types of analyses, including quantifying
feature complexity across layers, scaling automated interpretability from
insights into individual features to model-wide patterns. Finally, in user
studies, we find that semantic regex descriptions help people build accurate
mental models of LLM feature activations.

### [18] [Protecting De-identified Documents from Search-based Linkage Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06383)
*Pierre Lison,Mark Anderson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to prevent search-based linkage attacks on de-identified documents by identifying rare N-grams and using LLM-based rewriting to eliminate linkage risks while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current de-identification models fail to address linkage risks where de-identified text can be mapped back to its source through phrase extraction and database matching.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Build inverted index of N-grams to identify rare phrases appearing in fewer than k documents, 2) Use iterative LLM-based rewriting to reformulate these spans until linkage becomes impossible.

Result: Experimental results on court cases show the method effectively prevents search-based linkages while maintaining faithfulness to original content.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully counters search-based linkage attacks on de-identified documents by systematically identifying and rewriting rare phrases that could enable re-identification.

Abstract: While de-identification models can help conceal the identity of the
individual(s) mentioned in a document, they fail to address linkage risks,
defined as the potential to map the de-identified text back to its source. One
straightforward way to perform such linkages is to extract phrases from the
de-identified document and then check their presence in the original dataset.
This paper presents a method to counter search-based linkage attacks while
preserving the semantic integrity of the text. The method proceeds in two
steps. We first construct an inverted index of the N-grams occurring in the
document collection, making it possible to efficiently determine which N-grams
appear in less than $k$ documents (either alone or in combination with other
N-grams). An LLM-based rewriter is then iteratively queried to reformulate
those spans until linkage is no longer possible. Experimental results on a
collection of court cases show that the method is able to effectively prevent
search-based linkages while remaining faithful to the original content.

### [19] [Controllable Stylistic Text Generation with Train-Time Attribute-Regularized Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06386)
*Fan Zhou,Chang Tian,Tim Van de Cruys*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RegDiff is a regularized diffusion framework for controllable text generation that uses attribute features without needing pretrained classifiers during sampling, reducing computational costs while maintaining effective attribute control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion methods for text generation have limitations - classifier-free guidance preserves semantics but lacks attribute control, while classifier guidance enables better attribute alignment but has high computational costs and classifier generalization issues.

Method: RegDiff employs a VAE-based encoder-decoder architecture for reconstruction fidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision. Attribute information is injected only during training, not during sampling.

Result: Experiments on five datasets across multiple stylistic attributes show RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating stylistic texts effectively.

Conclusion: RegDiff provides an efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion by leveraging attribute features during training only, achieving better control without the computational overhead of classifier guidance during sampling.

Abstract: Generating stylistic text with specific attributes is a key problem in
controllable text generation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for both visual and textual generation. Existing approaches
can be broadly categorized into classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier
guidance (CG) methods. While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it
often fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies
the denoising trajectory using classifier gradients, enabling better attribute
alignment but incurring high computational costs during sampling and suffering
from classifier generalization issues. In this work, we propose RegDiff, a
regularized diffusion framework that leverages attribute features without
requiring a pretrained classifier during sampling, thereby achieving
controllable generation with reduced computational costs. Specifically, RegDiff
employs a VAE-based encoder--decoder architecture to ensure reconstruction
fidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision to
enable controllable text generation. Attribute information is injected only
during training. Experiments on five datasets spanning multiple stylistic
attributes demonstrate that RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating
stylistic texts. These results validate the effectiveness of RegDiff as an
efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion. Our code,
datasets, and resources will be released upon publication at

### [20] [Reward Model Perspectives: Whose Opinions Do Reward Models Reward?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06391)
*Elle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reward models (RMs) used for aligning language models show sociodemographic biases, poor alignment with various demographic groups, and systematic rewarding of harmful stereotypes, with steering techniques being insufficient to overcome these limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand RM behavior and investigate the extent to which RMs demonstrate sociodemographic biases, as RMs serve as proxies for human preferences in aligning language models but their behavior is poorly understood.

Method: Formalized a framework for measuring RM opinion alignment, studied subjective perspectives on controversial topics to quantify RM opinions/attitudes/values, and explored effects of prompting to steer rewards toward target group preferences.

Result: RMs are poorly aligned with several demographic groups, systematically reward harmful stereotypes, and steering techniques alone are insufficient to overcome these limitations.

Conclusion: More careful consideration of RM behavior is needed in model alignment during preference learning to prevent propagation of unwanted social biases in language technologies.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to the alignment of language models (LMs). An
RM often serves as a proxy for human preferences to guide downstream LM
behavior. However, our understanding of RM behavior is limited. Our work (i)
formalizes a framework for measuring the alignment of opinions captured by RMs,
(ii) investigates the extent to which RMs demonstrate sociodemographic biases,
and (iii) explores the effects of prompting to steer rewards towards the
preferences of a target group. We study the subjective and diverse perspectives
on controversial topics, which allows us to quantify RM perspectives in terms
of their opinions, attitudes, and values. We show that RMs are poorly aligned
with several demographic groups and can systematically reward harmful
stereotypes, and steering alone is not enough to overcome these limitations.
Our findings underscore the need for more careful consideration of RM behavior
in model alignment during preference learning to prevent the propagation of
unwanted social biases in the language technologies that we use.

*R. Alexander Knipper,Indrani Dey,Souvika Sarkar,Hari Narayanan,Sadhana Puntambekar,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs to help teachers generate instructional goal-aligned questions for Virtual Labs through natural language interaction, improving question quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers struggle to adapt Virtual Labs to instructional goals due to misaligned third-party materials and time-consuming custom resource development.

Method: Four-component framework: instructional goal understanding via teacher-LLM dialogue, lab understanding via knowledge analysis, question taxonomy for cognitive intent, and TELeR taxonomy for prompt control.

Result: Generated 1,100+ questions from 19 LLMs; framework improved cognitive demand (0.29-0.39 quality points), achieved 80% parsability, >90% adherence; larger models showed strongest gains (+37.1% parsability, +25.7% adherence, +0.8 quality points).

Conclusion: LLM-based framework effectively enables teachers to generate pedagogically meaningful, simulation-aligned questions for Virtual Labs through natural language interaction.

Abstract: Virtual Labs offer valuable opportunities for hands-on, inquiry-based science
learning, yet teachers often struggle to adapt them to fit their instructional
goals. Third-party materials may not align with classroom needs, and developing
custom resources can be time-consuming and difficult to scale. Recent advances
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing these
limitations. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment framework for
instructional goal-aligned question generation, enabling teachers to leverage
LLMs to produce simulation-aligned, pedagogically meaningful questions through
natural language interaction. The framework integrates four components:
instructional goal understanding via teacher-LLM dialogue, lab understanding
via knowledge unit and relationship analysis, a question taxonomy for
structuring cognitive and pedagogical intent, and the TELeR taxonomy for
controlling prompt detail. Early design choices were informed by a small
teacher-assisted case study, while our final evaluation analyzed over 1,100
questions from 19 open-source LLMs. With goal and lab understanding grounding
questions in teacher intent and simulation context, the question taxonomy
elevates cognitive demand (open-ended formats and relational types raise
quality by 0.29-0.39 points), and optimized TELeR prompts enhance format
adherence (80% parsability, >90% adherence). Larger models yield the strongest
gains: parsability +37.1%, adherence +25.7%, and average quality +0.8 Likert
points.

*Yitao Long,Tiansheng Hu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinLFQA is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on generating long-form financial answers with reliable attribution, focusing on supporting evidence, numerical reasoning, and domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on simple attribution with textual evidence, but real-world financial applications require more nuanced attribution including numerical reasoning and domain knowledge.

Method: Created FinLFQA benchmark with human annotations evaluating three attribution aspects: supporting evidence from reports, numerical reasoning steps, and financial domain knowledge. Also developed automatic evaluation framework for answer and attribution quality.

Result: Experiments on eight LLMs showed that fine-grained metrics distinguish model capabilities, end-to-end generation performs comparably to post-hoc approaches, and iterative refinement only helps with external feedback.

Conclusion: The FinLFQA benchmark provides comprehensive evaluation of LLM attribution capabilities in financial contexts, revealing important insights about model performance and refinement strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate to long-form questions,
producing plausible yet factually incorrect answers. A common mitigation
strategy is to provide attribution to LLM outputs. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on simple attribution that retrieves supporting textual
evidence as references. We argue that in real-world scenarios such as financial
applications, attribution goes beyond reference retrieval. We introduce
FinLFQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate
long-form answers to complex financial questions with reliable and nuanced
attributions. FinLFQA evaluates three critical aspects of attribution through
human annotations: (1) supporting evidence extracted from financial reports,
(2) intermediate numerical reasoning steps, and (3) domain-specific financial
knowledge that informs the reasoning process. We further provide an automatic
evaluation framework covering both answer quality and attribution quality.
Through extensive experiments on eight LLMs across multiple
attribution-generation paradigms, we find that fine-grained metrics are
important to distinguish model capabilities, that end-to-end generation
achieves comparable performance to post-hoc approaches, and that iterative
refinement only helps when guided by external feedback.

*Elena Chistova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniRST is the first unified RST-style discourse parser that handles 18 treebanks across 11 languages without modifying relation inventories, using parameter-efficient training strategies that outperform most mono-treebank baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a single multilingual discourse parser that can handle diverse treebanks across multiple languages without requiring inventory modifications, overcoming the challenge of incompatible relation inventories.

Method: Proposes two training strategies: Multi-Head (separate relation classification per inventory) and Masked-Union (shared parameter training with selective label masking), with augmentation for low-resource settings.

Result: Masked-Union approach is the strongest and most parameter-efficient; UniRST outperforms 16 out of 18 mono-treebank baselines, demonstrating superior cross-resource performance.

Conclusion: A single unified multilingual discourse parser can effectively handle diverse treebanks across languages, with the Masked-Union training strategy providing the best performance while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce UniRST, the first unified RST-style discourse parser capable of
handling 18 treebanks in 11 languages without modifying their relation
inventories. To overcome inventory incompatibilities, we propose and evaluate
two training strategies: Multi-Head, which assigns separate relation
classification layer per inventory, and Masked-Union, which enables shared
parameter training through selective label masking. We first benchmark
monotreebank parsing with a simple yet effective augmentation technique for
low-resource settings. We then train a unified model and show that (1) the
parameter efficient Masked-Union approach is also the strongest, and (2) UniRST
outperforms 16 of 18 mono-treebank baselines, demonstrating the advantages of a
single-model, multilingual end-to-end discourse parsing across diverse
resources.

### [24] [MathRobust-LV: Evaluation of Large Language Models' Robustness to Linguistic Variations in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06430)
*Neeraja Kirtane,Yuvraj Khanna,Peter Relan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathRobust-LV is a test set that evaluates LLMs' robustness to linguistic variations in math problems while keeping numerical structure constant. Most models show accuracy drops when problems are rephrased, revealing reasoning vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' math reasoning robustness in real educational settings where instructors rephrase problems with different surface details while maintaining the same numerical structure and difficulty.

Method: Created MathRobust-LV test set with problem variants that change surface details (names, contexts, variables) but preserve numerical structure and answers. Evaluated 34 models on baseline vs. variant problems.

Result: Accuracy declined when moving from baseline to variants across models. Smaller models showed severe drops (9-11%), stronger models had measurable degradation, while frontier models (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5pro) remained comparatively stable.

Conclusion: Robustness to linguistic variation is a fundamental challenge that exposes reasoning vulnerabilities in LLMs, even when mathematical structure remains unchanged. This is crucial for reliable deployment in educational applications.

Abstract: Large language models excel on math benchmarks, but their math reasoning
robustness to linguistic variation is underexplored. While recent work
increasingly treats high-difficulty competitions like the IMO as the gold
standard for evaluating reasoning, we believe in comprehensive benchmarking of
high school-level math problems in real educational settings. We introduce
MathRobust-LV, a test set and evaluation methodology that mirrors how
instructors rephrase problems across assessments while keeping difficulty
constant: we change surface details (names, contexts, variables) while
preserving numerical structure and answers. In contrast to prior efforts that
alter problem content or emphasize IMO-level tasks, we focus on
high-school-level dataset problems at the difficulty level where models are
currently deployed in educational settings: tutoring and assessment systems. In
these applications, instructors rephrase identical concepts in varied ways,
making linguistic robustness essential for reliable deployment. Although MATH
data benchmarking is often regarded as saturated, our experiment on 34 models
reveals that accuracy declines when moving from the baseline to the variants.
These drops are severe for smaller models (9-11%) while stronger models also
show measurable degradation. Frontier models like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5pro remain
comparatively stable. Our results highlight that robustness to linguistic
variation is a fundamental challenge, exposing reasoning vulnerabilities in
models.

Motivation: The rapid transition from passive LLMs to autonomous agents creates new cybersecurity risks that need systematic analysis and understanding.

Method: Conducted a holistic survey and comprehensive taxonomy of over 150 papers, structuring the analysis around three pillars: Applications, Threats, and Defenses.

Result: Created a detailed taxonomy explaining how agents are used, their vulnerabilities, and protective countermeasures, with cross-cutting analysis revealing emerging trends and research gaps.

Conclusion: The survey identifies critical research gaps in model and modality coverage while providing a structured framework for understanding the security landscape of autonomous LLM-agents.

Abstract: The rapid shift from passive LLMs to autonomous LLM-agents marks a new
paradigm in cybersecurity. While these agents can act as powerful tools for
both offensive and defensive operations, the very agentic context introduces a
new class of inherent security risks. In this work we present the first
holistic survey of the agentic security landscape, structuring the field around
three interdependent pillars: Applications, Threats, and Defenses. We provide a
comprehensive taxonomy of over 150 papers, explaining how agents are used, the
vulnerabilities they possess, and the countermeasures designed to protect them.
A detailed cross-cutting analysis shows emerging trends in agent architecture

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning wav2vec2 ASR model for Yan-nhangu language shows phonemic tokenization outperforms orthographic, and ASR-assisted transcription is faster than manual transcription.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ASR systems require large datasets, making them unsuitable for underresourced languages like Yan-nhangu, an Indigenous Australian language.

Method: Fine-tuned wav2vec2 ASR model on Yan-nhangu, comparing phonemic vs orthographic tokenization strategies.

Result: Phonemic tokenization substantially improved Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) compared to orthographic tokenization.

Conclusion: ASR can be viable for underresourced languages, with hand-correcting ASR output being much faster than manual transcription from scratch.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a crucial tool for linguists aiming to
perform a variety of language documentation tasks. However, modern ASR systems
use data-hungry transformer architectures, rendering them generally unusable
for underresourced languages. We fine-tune a wav2vec2 ASR model on Yan-nhangu,
a dormant Indigenous Australian language, comparing the effects of phonemic and
orthographic tokenization strategies on performance. In parallel, we explore
ASR's viability as a tool in a language documentation pipeline. We find that a
linguistically informed phonemic tokenization system substantially improves WER
and CER compared to a baseline orthographic tokenization scheme. Finally, we
show that hand-correcting the output of an ASR model is much faster than
hand-transcribing audio from scratch, demonstrating that ASR can work for
underresourced languages.

*Zihao Li,Shaoxiong Ji,Jörg Tiedemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (TTS) provides limited benefits for direct machine translation with general models but becomes effective with domain-specific fine-tuning and in post-editing workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether increased inference-time computation improves translation quality, as TTS has shown success in other reasoning tasks but remains underexplored in machine translation.

Method: Evaluated 12 reasoning models across diverse MT benchmarks using three scenarios: direct translation, forced-reasoning extrapolation, and post-editing.

Result: TTS provides limited benefits for direct translation with general models but works well with domain-specific fine-tuning and post-editing. Forcing models beyond natural stopping points degrades quality.

Conclusion: Inference-time computation in MT is valuable for multi-step self-correction workflows and task-specialized models, not for single-pass translation with general models.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has enhanced the performance of Reasoning Models
(RMs) on various tasks such as math and coding, yet its efficacy in machine
translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether
increased inference-time computation improves translation quality. We evaluate
12 RMs across a diverse suite of MT benchmarks spanning multiple domains,
examining three scenarios: direct translation, forced-reasoning extrapolation,
and post-editing. Our findings show that for general-purpose RMs, TTS provides
limited and inconsistent benefits for direct translation, with performance
quickly plateauing. However, the effectiveness of TTS is unlocked by
domain-specific fine-tuning, which aligns a model's reasoning process with task
requirements, leading to consistent improvements up to an optimal,
self-determined reasoning depth. We also find that forcing a model to reason
beyond its natural stopping point consistently degrades translation quality. In
contrast, TTS proves highly effective in a post-editing context, reliably
turning self-correction into a beneficial process. These results indicate that
the value of inference-time computation in MT lies not in enhancing single-pass
translation with general models, but in targeted applications like multi-step,
self-correction workflows and in conjunction with task-specialized models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the training-generation gap in LLMs and overcome the data bottleneck in RL applications by creating web-scale RL datasets comparable to pre-training corpora.

Method: Developed Webscale-RL pipeline that systematically converts pre-training documents into diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs, constructing a dataset of 1.2 million examples across 9+ domains.

Result: RL training with Webscale-RL dataset significantly outperforms continual pre-training and strong baselines across benchmarks, achieving same performance with up to 100x fewer tokens.

Conclusion: Webscale-RL presents a viable path to scale RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models by bridging the data gap between imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through
imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates a
training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning
(RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet
its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL
datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale
pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a
scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training
documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL.
Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2
million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the
model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining
and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL
training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the
performance of continual pre-training with up to 100$\times$ fewer tokens. Our
work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling
more capable and efficient language models.

### [29] [From Acceleration to Saturation: Scaling Behavior of Bootstrapped Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06548)
*Seng Pei Liew,Takuya Kato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bootstrapped pretraining efficiency diminishes predictably as base models become more overtrained, following a scaling law where benefits decrease logarithmically with initial pretraining tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness and scaling behavior of bootstrapped pretraining (reusing pretrained models for further training) and its limitations when applied to overtrained base models.

Method: Empirical study of bootstrapped pretraining scaling behavior, analyzing how scaling efficiency changes with the number of tokens used in base model pretraining and subsequent training stages.

Result: Found that scaling exponent decreases logarithmically with base model pretraining tokens, revealing a saturation effect where more extensively pretrained models benefit less from bootstrapping.

Conclusion: Bootstrapped pretraining has diminishing returns with overtrained models, revealing a fundamental trade-off in multi-stage training strategies and providing insights for efficient language model training.

Abstract: Bootstrapped pretraining, i.e., the reuse of a pretrained base model for
further pretraining, such as continual pretraining or model growth, is
promising at reducing the cost of training language models from scratch.
However, its effectiveness remains unclear, especially when applied to
overtrained base models. In this work, we empirically study the scaling
behavior of bootstrapped pretraining and find that its scaling efficiency
diminishes in a predictable manner: The scaling exponent with respect to
second-stage pretraining tokens decreases logarithmically with the number of
tokens used to pretrain the base model. The joint dependence on first- and
second-stage tokens is accurately modeled by a simple scaling law. Such
saturation effect reveals a fundamental trade-off in multi-stage pretraining
strategies: the more extensively a model is pretrained, the less additional
benefit bootstrapping provides. Our findings provide practical insights for
efficient language model training and raise important considerations for the
reuse of overtrained models.

### [30] [Flipping the Dialogue: Training and Evaluating User Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06552)
*Tarek Naous,Philippe Laban,Wei Xu,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Assistant LMs make poor user simulators - better assistants yield worse simulators. Purpose-built User LMs better simulate human behavior and reveal assistant struggles in realistic multi-turn conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LM performance in realistic settings, prior work used assistant LMs as user simulators, but these don't accurately represent how real users communicate with imperfections and refinements.

Method: Introduce User Language Models (User LMs) - models specifically post-trained to simulate human users in multi-turn conversations, rather than repurposing assistant LMs.

Result: User LMs align better with human behavior and achieve better simulation robustness. When used to simulate coding/math conversations, GPT-4o's performance drops from 74.6% to 57.4%, showing assistants struggle with realistic user nuances.

Conclusion: Realistic simulation environments using purpose-built User LMs reveal that assistants fail to cope with the nuances of human users in multi-turn conversations, highlighting the need for specialized user simulation methods.

Abstract: Conversations with LMs involve two participants: a human user leading the
conversation, and an LM assistant responding to the user's request. To satisfy
this specific role, LMs are post-trained to be helpful assistants -- optimized
to produce exhaustive and well-structured responses, free of ambiguity and
grammar errors. User utterances, on the other hand, are rarely perfected, with
each user phrasing requests in unique ways, sometimes putting in partial effort
at each turn and refining on the fly. To evaluate LM performance in realistic
settings, prior work simulated users in multi-turn conversations, often
prompting an LLM originally trained to be a helpful assistant to act as a user.
However, we show that assistant LMs make for poor user simulators, with the
surprising finding that better assistants yield worse simulators. Instead, we
introduce purpose-built User Language Models (User LMs) - models post-trained
to simulate human users in multi-turn conversations. Through various
evaluations, we show how User LMs align better with human behavior and achieve
better simulation robustness than existing simulation methods. When leveraging
User LMs to simulate coding and math conversations, the performance of a strong
assistant (GPT-4o) drops from 74.6% to 57.4%, confirming that more realistic
simulation environments lead to assistant struggles as they fail to cope with
the nuances of users in multi-turn setups.

### [31] [The Algebra of Meaning: Why Machines Need Montague More Than Moore's Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06559)
*Cheonkam Jeong,Sungdo Kim,Jewoo Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that treats language model alignment as a parsing problem using Montague semantics, addressing hallucination as type errors and enabling cross-jurisdictional compliance reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models mis-handle meaning types, leading to hallucination, brittle moderation, and opaque compliance outcomes. These issues stem from missing type-theoretic semantics rather than data or scale limitations.

Method: Savassan compiles utterances into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract structures from inputs, while symbolic components perform type checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping.

Result: The system enables "parse once" functionality that projects results into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into explainable decisions rather than binary censorship.

Conclusion: Trustworthy autonomy requires compositional typing of meaning, allowing systems to reason about descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions within a unified algebra of meaning.

Abstract: Contemporary language models are fluent yet routinely mis-handle the types of
meaning their outputs entail. We argue that hallucination, brittle moderation,
and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics
rather than data or scale limitations. Building on Montague's view of language
as typed, compositional algebra, we recast alignment as a parsing problem:
natural-language inputs must be compiled into structures that make explicit
their descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions under context.
  We present Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles utterances
into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies extended
with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract
candidate structures from unstructured inputs; symbolic components perform type
checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping to produce
compliance-aware guidance rather than binary censorship. In cross-border
scenarios, the system "parses once" (e.g., defect claim(product x, company y))
and projects the result into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk
in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into
a single, explainable decision.
  This paper contributes: (i) a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error;
(ii) a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning; and (iii)
a production-oriented design that embeds typed interfaces across the pipeline.
We outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic
multi-jurisdiction suites. Our position is that trustworthy autonomy requires
compositional typing of meaning, enabling systems to reason about what is
described, what is prescribed, and what incurs liability within a unified
algebra of meaning.

### [33] [Do Internal Layers of LLMs Reveal Patterns for Jailbreak Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06594)
*Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates jailbreaking in large language models by analyzing internal representations, showing distinct layer-wise behaviors between jailbreak and benign prompts in GPT-J and Mamba2 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreaking LLMs is a pressing concern as adversarial users exploit models to elicit restricted outputs, and existing defenses are insufficient against evolving attack techniques.

Method: Analyzed internal representations of LLMs, specifically examining how hidden layers respond to jailbreak versus benign prompts in GPT-J and Mamba2 models.

Result: Found distinct layer-wise behaviors in how models process jailbreak versus benign prompts, revealing differences in internal dynamics.

Conclusion: The findings suggest promising directions for leveraging internal model dynamics to develop more robust jailbreak detection and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a pressing concern
with the increasing prevalence and accessibility of conversational LLMs.
Adversarial users often exploit these models through carefully engineered
prompts to elicit restricted or sensitive outputs, a strategy widely referred
to as jailbreaking. While numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed,
attackers continuously develop novel prompting techniques, and no existing
model can be considered fully resistant. In this study, we investigate the
jailbreak phenomenon by examining the internal representations of LLMs, with a
focus on how hidden layers respond to jailbreak versus benign prompts.
Specifically, we analyze the open-source LLM GPT-J and the state-space model
Mamba2, presenting preliminary findings that highlight distinct layer-wise
behaviors. Our results suggest promising directions for further research on
leveraging internal model dynamics for robust jailbreak detection and defense.

*Nhat M. Hoang,Do Xuan Long,Cong-Duy Nguyen,Min-Yen Kan,Luu Anh Tuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified analysis of representation propagation in State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformer-Based Models (TBMs), revealing key differences in how they handle token representations across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs have emerged as efficient alternatives to TBMs for long-sequence processing, but how contextual information flows across layers and tokens in these architectures remains understudied.

Method: Used centered kernel alignment, stability metrics, and probing to characterize how representations evolve within and across layers in both SSMs and TBMs, supplemented by theoretical analysis and parameter randomization.

Result: Found that TBMs rapidly homogenize token representations early with diversity reemerging later, while SSMs preserve token uniqueness early but converge to homogenization deeper. Oversmoothing in TBMs stems from architectural design, while in SSMs it arises mainly from training dynamics.

Conclusion: These insights clarify the inductive biases of both architectures and inform future model and training designs for long-context reasoning.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformer-Based Models (TBMs) for long-sequence processing, offering linear
scaling and lower memory use. Yet, how contextual information flows across
layers and tokens in these architectures remains understudied. We present the
first unified, token- and layer-level analysis of representation propagation in
SSMs and TBMs. Using centered kernel alignment, stability metrics, and probing,
we characterize how representations evolve within and across layers. We find a
key divergence: TBMs rapidly homogenize token representations, with diversity
reemerging only in later layers, while SSMs preserve token uniqueness early but
converge to homogenization deeper. Theoretical analysis and parameter
randomization further reveal that oversmoothing in TBMs stems from
architectural design, whereas in SSMs it arises mainly from training dynamics.
These insights clarify the inductive biases of both architectures and inform
future model and training designs for long-context reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAO is a fully self-synthetic framework for LLM alignment that generates all training data (prompts, responses, and preferences) using the model itself, eliminating the need for expensive human or external AI annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLHF and RLAIF methods are expensive, requiring human-annotated datasets or external reward models. SAO aims to provide a cost-effective self-alignment solution without external dependencies.

Method: SAO instructs the LLM to engage in persona role-play to generate diverse prompts and responses, then self-evaluates these for preference optimization in a fully self-synthetic framework.

Result: SAO effectively enhances chat capabilities on benchmarks like AlpacaEval~2.0 while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks like question-answering and math reasoning.

Conclusion: SAO provides a practical solution for self-improvement in aligning LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional RLHF and RLAIF approaches.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large
language models (LLMs) relies on expensive human-annotated datasets, while
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) also incurs significant costs,
requiring the collection of diverse prompts and corresponding responses, often
necessitating external reward models or proprietary models like GPT-4 to
annotate preference pairs. In this work, we introduce Self-Alignment
Optimization (SAO), a fully self-synthetic framework for LLM alignment, where
all training data, including prompts (i.e., user queries), responses, and
preferences, are generated by the model itself. Specifically, SAO first
instructs the LLM to engage in persona role-play and generate diverse prompts
and responses, which are then self-evaluated for preference optimization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAO effectively enhances the model's
chat capabilities on standard benchmarks like AlpacaEval~2.0, while maintaining
strong performance on downstream objective tasks (e.g., question-answering,
math reasoning). Our work provides a practical solution for self-improvement in
aligning LLMs, and the code for reproducing our results is available at:

TL;DR: ToolMem enables AI agents to develop memory of tool capabilities from previous interactions, allowing them to select optimal tools for specific tasks by retrieving stored knowledge about tool strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents rely on fixed tools, limiting flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks, unlike humans who learn tool capabilities through interaction and apply this knowledge to future tasks.

Method: ToolMem enables agents to develop memories of tool capabilities by summarizing strengths and weaknesses from previous interactions and storing them in memory; at inference, agents retrieve relevant entries to select the best tool.

Result: ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and 28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios, and facilitate optimal tool selection by 21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

Conclusion: ToolMem successfully enables agents to learn from tool interactions and apply this knowledge for better tool selection, significantly improving performance in both text and multimodal generation tasks.

Abstract: Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse
tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as
calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly
across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied
scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the
flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In
contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different
tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal
tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from
this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of
tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths
and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve
relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual
tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation
and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic
agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and
28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios.
Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by
21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiKa introduces data-efficient alignment datasets that achieve expert-level performance using only 30k SFT examples, outperforming models trained on much larger datasets including proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF/RLAIF methods require massive high-quality instruction data that is often private or expensive to create, limiting reproducibility and scalability for academic and resource-limited communities.

Method: Created PiKa family of expert-level alignment datasets, particularly PiKa-SFT with only 30k examples, and fine-tuned Llama-3-8B-Base and Qwen2.5 series models on these datasets.

Result: PiKa-SFT fine-tuning outperforms models trained on much larger data, even surpassing official Llama-3-8B-Instruct trained on over 10M proprietary examples on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-quality LLM alignment can be achieved with significantly less data through carefully curated datasets, providing a scalable path for open-source model alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone
for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness depends
on high-quality instruction data. Most existing alignment datasets are either
private or require costly human annotation, which limits reproducibility and
scalability. Even with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF),
concerns about data quality remain. Moreover, it is unclear how much data is
actually required to fine-tune a base model into a strong instruction-following
model. Current approaches often rely on over 300k examples even at the
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, yet they still underperform compared to
proprietary models, creating barriers for academic and resource-limited
communities. To address this gap, we introduce PiKa, a data-efficient family of
expert-level alignment datasets. In particular, the PiKa-SFT dataset uses only
30k SFT examples, far fewer than state-of-the-art datasets like Magpie. Through
evaluations by fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base on PiKa and other public datasets,
we show that PiKa-SFT outperforms models trained on much larger data. On
AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, PiKa-SFT fine-tuning even surpasses
the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct model trained on over 10 million proprietary
examples. We further extend our study by training the Qwen2.5 series (0.5B to
7B) on PiKa-SFT, achieving consistent gains. These findings demonstrate that
high-quality alignment can be achieved with significantly less data, offering a
scalable path for open-source LLM alignment. Code and data:

Result: 3% reduction in case handling time (up to 9% in complex cases) compared to bulk summarization, with high agent satisfaction ratings from surveys.

Conclusion: Incremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary quality and agent productivity at scale in production environments.

Abstract: We introduce an incremental summarization system for customer support agents
that intelligently determines when to generate concise bullet notes during

Our approach combines a fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model for continuous note

edits refine the online notes generation and regularly inform offline model
retraining, closing the agent edits feedback loop. Deployed in production, our
system achieved a 3% reduction in case handling time compared to bulk

high agent satisfaction ratings from surveys. These results demonstrate that
incremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary
quality and agent productivity at scale.

*Qinhao Zhou,Xiang Xiang,Kun He,John E. Hopcroft*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel prompt optimization method for machine translation that uses small-parameter models with back-translation training, focusing on optimizing the input component rather than instruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt engineering methods focus on instruction optimization for general tasks using large LLMs, but are limited for machine translation where input component is more critical.

Method: Uses small-parameter model trained with back-translation strategy to optimize input component for machine translation tasks, reducing training overhead.

Result: Significantly reduces training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly effective performance.

Conclusion: The method can be extended to other downstream tasks with certain adaptations, providing efficient prompt optimization specifically for translation tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced prompt engineering, transitioning from manual design to
model-based optimization. Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components:
the \textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the
\textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language
generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \textit{input}
component is particularly critical, while the \textit{instruction} component
tends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on
optimizing the \textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often
requiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches
exhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the
\textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation,
this paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed
for machine translation tasks. The proposed approach employs a small-parameter
model trained using a back-translation-based strategy, significantly reducing
training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly
effective performance. With certain adaptations, this method can also be
extended to other downstream tasks.

*Leonardo Bertolazzi,Sandro Pezzelle,Raffaelle Bernardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit content effects where semantic plausibility biases logical validity judgments, similar to humans. The study shows validity and plausibility are linearly represented and aligned in LLMs' internal representations, causing conflation. Steering vectors can causally bias judgments between these concepts, and debiasing vectors can reduce content effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind content effects in LLMs - how plausibility biases logical validity judgments - and investigate how these abstract concepts are represented internally, since this phenomenon is explained by dual-process theory in humans but unclear in LLMs.

Method: Investigated how LLMs encode validity and plausibility in internal representations, used steering vectors to causally test biases between concepts, measured alignment in representational geometry, and constructed debiasing vectors to disentangle the concepts.

Result: Found both validity and plausibility are linearly represented and strongly aligned in LLMs' representations, leading to conflation. Plausibility vectors can causally bias validity judgments and vice versa. Alignment degree predicts behavioral content effects. Debiasing vectors successfully reduced content effects and improved reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: Content effects in LLMs arise from representational alignment between validity and plausibility concepts. Representational interventions like debiasing vectors can disentangle these concepts, reduce biases, and improve logical reasoning, offering a path toward more logical AI systems.

Abstract: Both humans and large language models (LLMs) exhibit content effects: biases
in which the plausibility of the semantic content of a reasoning problem
influences judgments regarding its logical validity. While this phenomenon in
humans is best explained by the dual-process theory of reasoning, the
mechanisms behind content effects in LLMs remain unclear. In this work, we
address this issue by investigating how LLMs encode the concepts of validity
and plausibility within their internal representations. We show that both
concepts are linearly represented and strongly aligned in representational
geometry, leading models to conflate plausibility with validity. Using steering
vectors, we demonstrate that plausibility vectors can causally bias validity
judgements, and vice versa, and that the degree of alignment between these two
concepts predicts the magnitude of behavioral content effects across models.
Finally, we construct debiasing vectors that disentangle these concepts,
reducing content effects and improving reasoning accuracy. Our findings advance
understanding of how abstract logical concepts are represented in LLMs and
highlight representational interventions as a path toward more logical systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUPO introduces summarization-based context management to enable RL fine-tuning of LLM agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, overcoming context length bottlenecks by compressing tool-using history while maintaining task-relevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL pipelines for LLM agents face challenges with degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and strict context limits that become fundamental bottlenecks for long-horizon multi-turn tool use tasks.

Method: SUPO uses periodic LLM-generated summaries to compress tool-using history, retaining task-relevant information while keeping context compact. It employs a policy gradient representation that optimizes both tool-use behaviors and summarization strategies end-to-end.

Result: Experiments on interactive function calling and searching tasks show SUPO significantly improves success rates while maintaining the same or lower working context length compared to baselines. For complex searching tasks, it further improves performance when scaling test-time summarization beyond training limits.

Conclusion: Summarization-based context management provides a principled and scalable approach for training RL agents beyond fixed context length limits, enabling effective long-horizon tool use in LLM agents.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model
(LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly
becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from
degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly,
strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce
summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it
periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that
retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the
agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation,
we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM
RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization
strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with
\underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization
(\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond
a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and
searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the
success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length
compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks,
\texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling
test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our
results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and
scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PTEB introduces a dynamic evaluation protocol using LLM-generated paraphrases to test sentence embedding robustness, revealing performance sensitivity to token variations despite preserved semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static benchmarks like MTEB can inflate performance metrics and obscure real-world robustness due to repeated tuning on fixed test data.

Method: Uses LLM-based method to generate meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time, aggregating results across multiple runs with semantic textual similarity validation.

Result: Shows sentence encoders are sensitive to token space changes even when semantics remain fixed, with statistically robust results across 7 MTEB tasks and 10 languages.

Conclusion: Proposes a shift from static benchmarks to dynamic, stochastic evaluation leveraging eval-time compute for more realistic NLP model assessment.

Abstract: Current evaluations of sentence embedding models typically rely on static
test beds such as the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While
invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported performance
and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding
Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates
meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across
multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in semantic
textual similarity gold ratings, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but
semantically preserving, paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our
hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in
token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller
models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results
are statistically robust over multiple runs and we extended our experiments to
3 multilingual datasets covering 10 languages. More generally, we aim to
propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static,
pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation
leveraging eval-time compute.

*Tiancheng Xing,Jerry Li,Yixuan Du,Xiyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAF is a two-stage token optimization method that crafts natural-looking prompts to manipulate LLM rerankers, consistently promoting target items while remaining hard to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the vulnerability of LLM-based reranking systems to adversarial manipulation through small, natural-sounding prompts, highlighting security concerns in modern retrieval systems.

Method: Two-stage token optimization: Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens combining gradient of rank-target with readability score; Stage 2 evaluates candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using entropy-based dynamic weighting and temperature-controlled sampling.

Result: RAF significantly boosts target item ranks using naturalistic language across multiple LLMs, showing greater robustness than existing methods in both promotion effectiveness and naturalness preservation.

Conclusion: LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation, raising critical security challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern retrieval systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in
information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small,
natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank
Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise
textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated
rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate
Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the
gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those
candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based
dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled
sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by
dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic
naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly
boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater
robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining
naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication:
LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation,
raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern
retrieval systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/glad-lab/RAF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting intellectual property of LLMs by reliably determining if suspect models are trained from scratch or derived from existing models, addressing challenges from intensive post-training processes.

Method: Training-free fingerprinting based on weight matrices using Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and unbiased Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize parameter manipulation effects.

Result: Perfect classification scores on 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, exceptional robustness against all six post-training categories, near-zero false positive risk, and 30s computation on NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: Establishes strong basis for reliable model lineage verification with high robustness and fidelity, providing effective IP protection for LLMs.

Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial, given the substantial resources required for their training.
Consequently, there is an urgent need for both model owners and third parties
to determine whether a suspect LLM is trained from scratch or derived from an
existing base model. However, the intensive post-training processes that models
typically undergo-such as supervised fine-tuning, extensive continued
pretraining, reinforcement learning, multi-modal extension, pruning, and
upcycling-pose significant challenges to reliable identification. In this work,
we propose a training-free fingerprinting method based on weight matrices. We
leverage the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and an unbiased Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize the effects of parameter
manipulations, yielding a highly robust and high-fidelity similarity metric. On
a comprehensive testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, our method
demonstrates exceptional robustness against all six aforementioned
post-training categories while exhibiting a near-zero risk of false positives.
By achieving perfect scores on all classification metrics, our approach

*I-Fan Lin,Faegheh Hasibi,Suzan Verberne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free, label-free method for short text clustering that works with any embedder, using iterative vector updating and LLM guidance without requiring labeled data or prior knowledge of cluster numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Companies using customer-facing chatbots need to cluster large amounts of user utterances by intent, but typically have no labeled data and unknown number of clusters in commercial settings.

Method: Iterative vector updating: constructs sparse vectors from representative texts and refines them through LLM guidance, without requiring training or labels.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods, works with diverse datasets and smaller LLMs, is model-agnostic, and scales to large datasets with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: The method is well-suited for real-world scenarios due to its low-resource requirements, adaptability, and scalability compared to existing clustering approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free and label-free method for short
text clustering that can be used on top of any existing embedder. In the
context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts
of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In
these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the
number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector
updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then
iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable
or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning,
but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on
diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and
can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different
clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets,
reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable
settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world
scenarios than existing clustering methods.

### [46] [A Formal Framework for Fluency-based Multi-Reference Evaluation in Grammatical Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06749)
*Eitan Klinger,Zihao Huang,Tran Minh Nguyen,Emma Jayeon Park,Yige Chen,Yang Gu,Qingyu Gao,Siliang Liu,Mengyang Qiu,Jungyeul Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fluency-based multi-reference evaluation framework for grammatical error correction that uses n-gram similarity with different aggregation strategies to handle diverse valid corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GEC metrics are edit-based, English-centric, and rely on rigid alignments, limiting their applicability in multilingual and generative settings where multiple valid corrections exist.

Method: Proposes a formal framework with four aggregation strategies (select-best, simple-average, weighted-average, merged-counts) for n-gram similarity evaluation over multiple reference corrections.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese corpora shows the strategies capture complementary aspects of fluency and coverage.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled, fluency-oriented approach that incorporates linguistic diversity without penalizing legitimate variation in grammatical error correction.

Abstract: Evaluating grammatical error correction requires metrics that reflect the
diversity of valid human corrections rather than privileging a single
reference. Existing frameworks, largely edit-based and English-centric, rely on
rigid alignments between system and reference edits, limiting their
applicability in multilingual and generative settings. This paper introduces a
formal framework for \textit{fluency-based multi-reference evaluation}, framing
$n$-gram similarity as an aggregation problem over multiple legitimate
corrections. Within this formulation, we instantiate GLEU through four
aggregation strategies--\textsc{select-best}, \textsc{simple-average},
\textsc{weighted-average}, and \textsc{merged-counts}--and analyze their
properties of boundedness, monotonicity, and sensitivity to reference
variation. Empirical results on Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese corpora
show that these strategies capture complementary aspects of fluency and
coverage. The framework unifies multi-reference evaluation into a principled,
fluency-oriented approach that incorporates linguistic diversity without
penalizing legitimate variation.

*Jaeseong Lee,Dayoung Kwon,seung-won hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A superposed deployment strategy with training-free regulation to optimize LRM inference by selectively unlearning to prevent overthinking while preserving reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models suffer from overthinking that degrades performance and wastes resources, but deploying multiple models (LLM + LRM) for routing is costly and impractical.

Method: Use lightweight, training-free regulation to switch model components on/off during inference. Analyze cumulative energy of singular values to identify optimal low-rank projections for selective unlearning from LRM.

Result: Enables scaling down computation while preserving reasoning capabilities by adjusting reasoning 'just right' without full model deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed superposed deployment strategy with selective unlearning provides an efficient alternative to costly multi-model routing for preventing overthinking in Large Reasoning Models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel in structured tasks by emulating
deliberate human reasoning but often suffer from overthinking, degrading
performance and wasting resources. One possible baseline is to deploy both LLM
and LRM, then route input by predicting whether it requires reasoning and may
cause overthinking. However, deploying multiple models can be costly or
impractical. We propose a superposed deployment strategy with a lightweight,
training-free regulation to optimize inference by switching one model on and
off. Instead of routing, we selectively unlearn from LRM at inference, scaling
down computation while preserving reasoning. By analyzing the cumulative energy
of singular values, we identify optimal low-rank projections to adjust
reasoning just right.

### [48] [Adaptive LLM-Symbolic Reasoning via Dynamic Logical Solver Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06774)
*Lei Xu,Pierre Beckmann,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An adaptive neuro-symbolic framework that automatically identifies formal reasoning strategies from natural language problems and dynamically selects appropriate logical solvers, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuro-symbolic NLP methods are static and predetermined at design time, limiting the ability to employ diverse formal inference strategies for different reasoning tasks.

Method: An adaptive multi-paradigm neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically identifies formal reasoning strategies from natural language problems, and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical solvers via autoformalization interfaces.

Result: LLMs achieve over 90% accuracy in predicting necessary formal reasoning strategies. The framework outperforms GPT-4o by 27% and DeepSeek-V3.1 by 6%. Adaptive reasoning also improves pure LLM methods by 10%, 5%, and 6% on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT settings with GPT-4o.

Conclusion: This work establishes foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic reasoning, offering a path to unify material and formal inferences on heterogeneous reasoning challenges, with post-training helping smaller models improve.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic NLP methods aim to leverage the complementary strengths of
large language models and formal logical solvers. However, current approaches
are mostly static in nature, i.e., the integration of a target solver is
predetermined at design time, hindering the ability to employ diverse formal
inference strategies. To address this, we introduce an adaptive,
multi-paradigm, neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically
identifies formal reasoning strategies from problems expressed in natural
language; and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical
solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Extensive experiments on individual
and multi-paradigm reasoning tasks support the following conclusions: LLMs are
effective at predicting the necessary formal reasoning strategies with an
accuracy above 90 percent. This enables flexible integration with formal
logical solvers, resulting in our framework outperforming competing baselines
by 27 percent and 6 percent compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively.
Moreover, adaptive reasoning can even positively impact pure LLM methods,
yielding gains of 10, 5, and 6 percent on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT
settings with GPT-4o. Finally, although smaller models struggle with adaptive
neuro-symbolic reasoning, post-training offers a viable path to improvement.
Overall, this work establishes the foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic
reasoning, offering a path forward for unifying material and formal inferences
on heterogeneous reasoning challenges.

### [49] [Foundations of LLM Knowledge Materialization: Termination, Reproducibility, Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06780)
*Luca Giordano,Simon Razniewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic study of LLM knowledge extraction shows high termination rates but mixed reproducibility and varying robustness across different perturbation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure and systematize LLM factual knowledge by converting it into structured format, addressing open questions about termination, reproducibility, and robustness of extraction methods.

Method: Used miniGPTKBs (domain-specific subcrawls) to analyze LLM knowledge materialization across three metric categories (yield, lexical similarity, semantic similarity) with four variations (seed, language, randomness, model) in three domains (history, entertainment, finance).

Result: High termination rates (model-dependent), mixed reproducibility, and robustness that varies by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and models.

Conclusion: LLM knowledge materialization can reliably surface core knowledge but has important limitations in reproducibility and robustness to certain perturbations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, yet
measuring and systematizing this knowledge remains challenging. Converting it
into structured format, for example through recursive extraction approaches
such as the GPTKB methodology (Hu et al., 2025b), is still underexplored. Key
open questions include whether such extraction can terminate, whether its
outputs are reproducible, and how robust they are to variations. We
systematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs
(domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility,
and robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity,
and semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language,
randomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment,
and finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though
model-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies
by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and
models. These results suggest that LLM knowledge materialization can reliably
surface core knowledge, while also revealing important limitations.

*Haotian Wu,Shufan Jiang,Chios Chen,Yiyang Feng,Hehai Lin,Heqing Zou,Yao Shu,Yanran Li,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FURINA-Builder is a multi-agent pipeline that automatically creates customizable role-playing benchmarks, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks. It enables evaluation of arbitrary characters across diverse scenarios and formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing role-playing benchmarks are becoming obsolete due to narrow scope, outdated interaction paradigms, and limited adaptability across diverse application scenarios.

Method: FURINA-Builder uses multi-agent collaboration to simulate dialogues between test characters and other characters from a character-scene pool, with an LLM judge selecting evaluation dimensions and adjusting responses into test utterances.

Result: The pipeline built FURINA-Bench, a comprehensive RP benchmark. Evaluations show o3 and DeepSeek-R1 perform best on English and Chinese tasks respectively. Established characters outperform synthesized ones, and reasoning capabilities amplify this disparity. Model scale doesn't monotonically reduce hallucinations, and reasoning LLMs show a trade-off between improved RP performance and increased hallucinations.

Conclusion: FURINA-Builder effectively addresses benchmark limitations and FURINA-Bench poses significant challenges, revealing a Pareto frontier between RP performance and reliability across all LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in role-playing (RP) tasks, existing
benchmarks quickly become obsolete due to their narrow scope, outdated
interaction paradigms, and limited adaptability across diverse application
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FURINA-Builder, a novel
multi-agent collaboration pipeline that automatically constructs fully
customizable RP benchmarks at any scale. It enables evaluation of arbitrary
characters across diverse scenarios and prompt formats, as the first benchmark
builder in RP area for adaptable assessment. FURINA-Builder simulates dialogues
between a test character and other characters drawn from a well-constructed
character-scene pool, while an LLM judge selects fine-grained evaluation
dimensions and adjusts the test character's responses into final test
utterances. Using this pipeline, we build FURINA-Bench, a new comprehensive
role-playing benchmark featuring both established and synthesized test
characters, each assessed with dimension-specific evaluation criteria. Human
evaluation and preliminary separability analysis justify our pipeline and
benchmark design. We conduct extensive evaluations of cutting-edge LLMs and
find that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 achieve the best performance on English and
Chinese RP tasks, respectively. Across all models, established characters
consistently outperform synthesized ones, with reasoning capabilities further
amplifying this disparity. Interestingly, we observe that model scale does not
monotonically reduce hallucinations. More critically, for reasoning LLMs, we
uncover a novel trade-off: reasoning improves RP performance but simultaneously
increases RP hallucinations. This trade-off extends to a broader Pareto
frontier between RP performance and reliability for all LLMs. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of FURINA-Builder and the challenge posed by
FURINA-Bench.

*André Greiner-Petter,Maik Fröbe,Jan Philip Wahle,Terry Ruas,Bela Gipp,Akiko Aizawa,Martin Potthast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The PAN 2025 generative plagiarism detection task focuses on identifying AI-generated plagiarism in scientific articles using a novel dataset created with Llama, DeepSeek-R1, and Mistral models. While semantic similarity approaches show promising results on the new dataset, they lack generalizability when tested on older data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emerging challenge of detecting automatically generated plagiarism in scientific articles created by large language models, and to evaluate the robustness of detection approaches across different datasets.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset of automatically generated plagiarism using three LLMs (Llama, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral), compared participant results with four baselines, and evaluated approaches on the PAN 2015 dataset to test generalizability.

Result: Semantic similarity approaches based on embedding vectors achieved up to 0.8 recall and 0.5 precision on the new dataset, but most approaches significantly underperformed on the 2015 dataset, indicating poor generalizability.

Conclusion: Current approaches for detecting generative plagiarism show promise on specific datasets but lack robustness and generalizability across different data sources, highlighting the need for more versatile detection methods.

Abstract: The generative plagiarism detection task at PAN 2025 aims at identifying
automatically generated textual plagiarism in scientific articles and aligning
them with their respective sources. We created a novel large-scale dataset of
automatically generated plagiarism using three large language models: Llama,
DeepSeek-R1, and Mistral. In this task overview paper, we outline the creation
of this dataset, summarize and compare the results of all participants and four
baselines, and evaluate the results on the last plagiarism detection task from
PAN 2015 in order to interpret the robustness of the proposed approaches. We
found that the current iteration does not invite a large variety of approaches
as naive semantic similarity approaches based on embedding vectors provide
promising results of up to 0.8 recall and 0.5 precision. In contrast, most of
these approaches underperform significantly on the 2015 dataset, indicating a
lack in generalizability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates ensembling methods for circuit localization in LLMs, showing that both parallel and sequential ensembling improve performance, with parallel ensemble over multiple methods achieving the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve circuit localization performance in large language models by exploring whether combining multiple localization methods through ensembling can yield better results than individual methods alone.

Method: Two ensembling approaches: parallel ensembling (combining attribution scores from different methods via averaging, min, or max) and sequential ensembling (using EAP-IG scores as warm start for edge pruning). Evaluated on MIB benchmark.

Result: Both parallel and sequential ensembling approaches yield notable gains on benchmark metrics, leading to more precise circuit identification. Parallel ensemble over various methods including the sequential ensemble achieves the best results.

Conclusion: Ensembling circuit localization methods, particularly parallel ensembling across multiple approaches, significantly improves circuit identification performance in LLMs.

Abstract: The Circuit Localization track of the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark
(MIB) evaluates methods for localizing circuits within large language models
(LLMs), i.e., subnetworks responsible for specific task behaviors. In this
work, we investigate whether ensembling two or more circuit localization
methods can improve performance. We explore two variants: parallel and
sequential ensembling. In parallel ensembling, we combine attribution scores
assigned to each edge by different methods-e.g., by averaging or taking the
minimum or maximum value. In the sequential ensemble, we use edge attribution
scores obtained via EAP-IG as a warm start for a more expensive but more
precise circuit identification method, namely edge pruning. We observe that
both approaches yield notable gains on the benchmark metrics, leading to a more
precise circuit identification approach. Finally, we find that taking a
parallel ensemble over various methods, including the sequential ensemble,
achieves the best results. We evaluate our approach in the BlackboxNLP 2025 MIB
Shared Task, comparing ensemble scores to official baselines across multiple
model-task combinations.

TL;DR: MTR is a simulation-first training framework for tool-augmented reasoning that learns from complete ReAct traces with simulated observations instead of live APIs, achieving competitive performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool-augmented language models face scalability and reliability challenges due to their reliance on live API access during training and deployment.

Method: Multi-agent architecture with ToolMaker, AutoAgent, and ToolActor components; two-stage training: Stage-1 SFT teaches 'trace grammar' from reasoning sequences, Stage-2 GRPO optimizes strategy with composite trace reward balancing correctness and consistency.

Result: Attains competitive Exact Match scores to live-API systems across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, Bamboogle) and excels on reasoning-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: Effective tool reasoning can be learned from structured traces without live interactions, offering a scalable alternative to live-API systems.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models have demonstrated strong capabilities, but
their reliance on live API access creates scalability and reliability
challenges during training and deployment. We propose MTR, a simulation-first
training framework for tool-augmented reasoning. Instead of relying on live
APIs, MTR learns from complete ReAct traces with schema-validated, simulated
observations. Our approach operates through a multi-agent architecture where a
ToolMaker generates task-specific, OpenAI-compatible tool interfaces, an
AutoAgent produces structured think-act-observe sequences, and a ToolActor
simulates realistic responses. Training proceeds in two stages: Stage-1
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) teaches 'trace grammar' from complete reasoning
sequences; Stage-2 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) optimizes strategy
with a composite trace reward that balances answer correctness and internal
consistency. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue,
2WikiMultiHopQA, Bamboogle), MTR attains competitive Exact Match (EM) scores to
live-API systems and excels on reasoning-intensive tasks, suggesting that
effective tool reasoning can be learned from structured traces without live
interactions.

TL;DR: Mid-training is an intermediate stage between pre-training and fine-tuning that refines data quality, adapts optimization schedules, and extends context length to improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diminishing returns from noisy tokens, stabilize convergence, and expand model capability in late training by introducing an intermediate mid-training stage.

Method: Multiple annealing-style phases that refine data quality, adapt optimization schedules, and extend context length, explained through gradient noise scale, information bottleneck, and curriculum learning.

Result: Improved generalization and abstraction, with practical gains reported across models and compiled evaluation benchmarks for structured comparisons.

Conclusion: Mid-training is an effective paradigm that enables better LLM development, though open challenges remain for future research and practice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically developed through large-scale
pre-training followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Recent advances highlight
the importance of an intermediate mid-training stage, where models undergo
multiple annealing-style phases that refine data quality, adapt optimization
schedules, and extend context length. This stage mitigates diminishing returns
from noisy tokens, stabilizes convergence, and expands model capability in late
training. Its effectiveness can be explained through gradient noise scale, the
information bottleneck, and curriculum learning, which together promote
generalization and abstraction. Despite widespread use in state-of-the-art
systems, there has been no prior survey of mid-training as a unified paradigm.
We introduce the first taxonomy of LLM mid-training spanning data distribution,
learning-rate scheduling, and long-context extension. We distill practical
insights, compile evaluation benchmarks, and report gains to enable structured
comparisons across models. We also identify open challenges and propose avenues
for future research and practice.

TL;DR: A large-scale challenge set is created to analyze gender bias in automatic quality estimation (QE) metrics across 33 language pairs, focusing on gender-ambiguous occupational terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender bias in machine translation systems is well-documented, but bias in automatic quality estimation metrics remains underexplored, with existing studies limited by small datasets and narrow coverage.

Method: Built on the GAMBIT corpus, extended to three source languages (genderless or natural-gendered) and eleven target languages with grammatical gender. Each source text is paired with two target versions differing only in grammatical gender of occupational terms.

Result: The dataset enables fine-grained bias analysis by occupation and systematic comparisons across languages, with scale, breadth, and fully parallel design.

Conclusion: An unbiased QE metric should assign equal or near-equal scores to both masculine and feminine versions of translations containing gender-ambiguous occupational terms.

Abstract: Gender bias in machine translation (MT) systems has been extensively
documented, but bias in automatic quality estimation (QE) metrics remains
comparatively underexplored. Existing studies suggest that QE metrics can also
exhibit gender bias, yet most analyses are limited by small datasets, narrow
occupational coverage, and restricted language variety. To address this gap, we
introduce a large-scale challenge set specifically designed to probe the
behavior of QE metrics when evaluating translations containing gender-ambiguous
occupational terms. Building on the GAMBIT corpus of English texts with
gender-ambiguous occupations, we extend coverage to three source languages that
are genderless or natural-gendered, and eleven target languages with
grammatical gender, resulting in 33 source-target language pairs. Each source
text is paired with two target versions differing only in the grammatical
gender of the occupational term(s) (masculine vs. feminine), with all dependent
grammatical elements adjusted accordingly. An unbiased QE metric should assign
equal or near-equal scores to both versions. The dataset's scale, breadth, and
fully parallel design, where the same set of texts is aligned across all
languages, enables fine-grained bias analysis by occupation and systematic
comparisons across languages.

*Xuhang Chen,Zhifan Song,Deyi Ji,Shuo Gao,Lanyun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SID introduces a self-signals driven approach for multi-LLM debate that uses model confidence and token-level attention to optimize debate efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-LLM Agent Debate methods focus on external structures and neglect internal self-signals like token logits and attention, leading to redundant computation and potential performance issues.

Method: Leverages two self-signals: model-level confidence for early exit of high-confidence agents, and token-level semantic focus via attention mechanism to compress redundant debate content.

Result: Outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy while reducing token consumption across various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs on multiple challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Utilizing self signals effectively enhances both performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems, demonstrating the value of internal model signals over purely external debate structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate
(MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and
refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly
focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using
LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token
logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to
redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we
shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a
Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of
self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to
adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence
agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate
contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various
LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD
techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the
effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and
efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are strong in machine translation but struggle with discourse phenomena like pronoun resolution and lexical cohesion at document level.

Method: Propose quality-aware decoding (QAD) to extract discourse knowledge encoded within LLMs, comparing it with other decoding approaches.

Result: QAD shows superiority over other decoding methods, enhances semantic richness of translations, and aligns them more closely with human preferences.

Conclusion: Discourse knowledge is encoded in LLMs and can be effectively extracted using QAD to improve context-aware translation performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as strong contenders in machine
translation.Yet, they still struggle to adequately handle discourse phenomena,
such as pronoun resolution and lexical cohesion at the document level. In this
study, we thoroughly investigate the discourse phenomena performance of LLMs in
context-aware translation. We demonstrate that discourse knowledge is encoded
within LLMs and propose the use of quality-aware decoding (QAD) to effectively
extract this knowledge, showcasing its superiority over other decoding
approaches through comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate that QAD
enhances the semantic richness of translations and aligns them more closely
with human preferences.

*Yining Wang,Jinman Zhao,Chuangxin Zhao,Shuhao Guan,Gerald Penn,Shinan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces λ-GRPO, a method that learns token-level preferences during optimization to address length bias in RLHF approaches like GRPO, achieving consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning benchmarks without additional computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods like GRPO suffer from length bias where longer responses disproportionately influence gradient updates, and current variants like DAPO and Dr. GRPO use heuristic approaches with limited interpretability of token preferences.

Method: The authors unify existing frameworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter λ that adaptively controls token-level weighting during optimization, allowing the model to learn its own token preferences.

Result: λ-GRPO achieves consistent improvements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving average accuracy by +1.9%, +1.0%, and +1.7% on Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters respectively.

Conclusion: Learning token preferences through λ-GRPO is an effective and practical approach that improves reasoning capabilities without modifications to training data or additional computational cost, addressing fundamental limitations in existing RLHF methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the dominant
approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
simplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with
rule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same
advantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result,
longer responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute
disproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr.
GRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain
heuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token
preferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to
learn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing
frameworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter
$\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\lambda$-GRPO
to denote our method, and we find that $\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent
improvements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\lambda$-GRPO
improves average accuracy by $+1.9\%$, $+1.0\%$, and $+1.7\%$ compared to GRPO,
respectively. Importantly, these gains come without any modifications to the
training data or additional computational cost, highlighting the effectiveness
and practicality of learning token preferences.

### [60] [MeXtract: Light-Weight Metadata Extraction from Scientific Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06889)
*Zaid Alyafeai,Maged S. Al-Shaibani,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeXtract is a family of lightweight language models (0.5B-3B parameters) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on metadata extraction from scientific papers, demonstrating strong generalization across domains and schema variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metadata extraction approaches struggle with generalization across domains and schema variations, creating a need for more robust and adaptable solutions for scientific literature indexing and analysis.

Method: Fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 counterparts to create lightweight models (0.5B-3B parameters) and extending the MOLE benchmark with model-specific metadata for evaluation.

Result: MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art performance on metadata extraction in its size family, showing that fine-tuning on a given schema yields high accuracy and effectively transfers to unseen schemas.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robustness and adaptability, with all code, datasets, and models released openly for the research community.

Abstract: Metadata plays a critical role in indexing, documenting, and analyzing
scientific literature, yet extracting it accurately and efficiently remains a
challenging task. Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or
task-specific models, which struggle to generalize across domains and schema
variations. In this paper, we present MeXtract, a family of lightweight
language models designed for metadata extraction from scientific papers. The
models, ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters, are built by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5
counterparts. In their size family, MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art
performance on metadata extraction on the MOLE benchmark. To further support
evaluation, we extend the MOLE benchmark to incorporate model-specific
metadata, providing an out-of-domain challenging subset. Our experiments show
that fine-tuning on a given schema not only yields high accuracy but also
transfers effectively to unseen schemas, demonstrating the robustness and
adaptability of our approach. We release all the code, datasets, and models
openly for the research community.

*Zecheng Tang,Baibei Ji,Quantong Qiu,Haitian Wang,Xiaobo Liang,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Long-RewardBench is introduced to evaluate reward models on long-context scenarios, revealing that current models struggle with context-response consistency. A multi-stage training strategy is proposed to create robust Long-context RMs that outperform larger baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications increasingly involve long history trajectories (e.g., LLM agents), requiring evaluation of whether responses are grounded in and consistent with long contexts, which current RMs fail to address.

Method: Introduce Long-RewardBench benchmark with Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks, and propose a multi-stage training strategy to scale arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs).

Result: The approach substantially improves performance on long-context evaluation while preserving strong short-context capability. An 8B LongRM outperforms 70B-scale baselines and matches proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage training strategy effectively creates robust long-context reward models that address the critical gap in context-response consistency evaluation for long trajectories.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM)
with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long
history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate
whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and
consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to
short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g.,
safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long
context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a
benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both
Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that
even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in
long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments.
Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we
propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales
arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that
our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context
evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B
LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance
of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

### [62] [SHANKS: Simultaneous Hearing and Thinking for Spoken Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06917)
*Cheng-Han Chiang,Xiaofei Wang,Linjie Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Shujie Liu,Zhendong Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Hung-yi Lee,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHANKS is a real-time inference framework that enables spoken language models to generate unspoken reasoning while listening to user input, allowing for low-latency interactions and interruptions during speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs/SLMs only think after users finish speaking, causing high latency that's unsuitable for real-time speech-to-speech interaction. Humans naturally "think while listening," which inspired this approach.

Method: Streams input speech in chunks, generates unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning after each chunk while user continues speaking, uses reasoning to decide interruptions and tool calls.

Result: 37.1% higher interruption accuracy in math problem scenarios compared to baseline; completes 56.9% of tool calls before user finishes turn in tool-augmented dialogues.

Conclusion: SHANKS enables models to think throughout conversations rather than only after turns end, moving toward more natural, real-time human-model interaction.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin
thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This
prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high
response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after
receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,
where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting
that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose
SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken
chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams
the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received,
generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while
the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide
whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We
demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two
scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math
problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a
mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that
interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can
complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall,
SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not
only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Open ASR Leaderboard is a reproducible benchmark evaluating 60+ ASR systems across 11 datasets, with standardized evaluation metrics including WER and efficiency (RTFx).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR evaluation is dominated by short-form English and rarely reports efficiency metrics, creating a need for comprehensive, fair benchmarking.

Method: Created a fully reproducible benchmark with standardized text normalization, evaluating systems across multilingual and long-form tracks using WER and inverse real-time factor (RTFx).

Result: Conformer encoders with LLM decoders achieve best WER but are slower, while CTC/TDT decoders offer better efficiency. Whisper fine-tuning improves English accuracy but reduces multilingual coverage.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons and supports transparent, extensible ASR evaluation through open-sourced code and dataset loaders.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form
English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR
Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard
comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including
dedicated multilingual and long-form tracks. We standardize text normalization
and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx),
enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription,
Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but
are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them
attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned
for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All
code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible
evaluation.

*Bryan R. Christ,Penelope Molitz,Jonathan Kropko,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate customized math word problems for students, with teacher-annotated data enabling smaller models to match larger ones and outperform closed baselines. Student studies show similar performance on LLM-generated vs human-written problems, but preference for customized content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers struggle to customize math word problems for individual students due to large class sizes and burnout, while personalized problems can improve learning outcomes.

Method: Used joint human expert-LLM evaluation of 11,000+ MWPs, created teacher-annotated dataset, trained 12B and 30B open models, and conducted student studies comparing LLM-generated vs human-written problems.

Result: 12B model matched larger models' performance; 30B model outperformed closed baselines; LLM-generated MWPs were more similar to human-written ones; students performed similarly on both but preferred customized problems.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively generate standards-aligned, customized math word problems that students prefer, supporting personalized math education at scale.

Abstract: Math word problems (MWPs) are critical K-12 educational tools, and
customizing them to students' interests and ability levels can increase
learning outcomes. However, teachers struggle to find time to customize MWPs
for each student given large class sizes and increasing burnout. We propose
that LLMs can support math education by generating MWPs customized to student
interests and math education standards. To this end, we use a joint human
expert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and
closed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for
standards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by
using it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and
more capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a
text classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed
baselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar
to human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by
conducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school
students, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to
human-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs.

*Geng Liu,Feng Li,Junjie Mu,Mengxiao Zhu,Francesco Pierri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates social identity biases in Chinese LLMs, finding systematic ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative tendencies across ten models using Mandarin prompts and real chatbot conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in user-facing applications, there are concerns about their potential to reflect and amplify social biases, particularly in non-English contexts like Chinese.

Method: Used Mandarin-specific prompts across ten Chinese LLMs to evaluate responses to ingroup ("We") and outgroup ("They") framings across 240 social groups, and analyzed real chatbot conversations from a corpus of user interactions.

Result: Found systematic ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative tendencies across all models, with biases appearing not only in synthetic prompts but also in naturalistic dialogue, suggesting bias dynamics might strengthen in real interactions.

Conclusion: Social identity biases documented in English LLMs generalize cross-linguistically to Chinese models and intensify in user-facing contexts, providing a language-aware evaluation framework for Chinese LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in user-facing
applications, raising concerns about their potential to reflect and amplify
social biases. We investigate social identity framing in Chinese LLMs using
Mandarin-specific prompts across ten representative Chinese LLMs, evaluating
responses to ingroup ("We") and outgroup ("They") framings, and extending the
setting to 240 social groups salient in the Chinese context. To complement
controlled experiments, we further analyze Chinese-language conversations from
a corpus of real interactions between users and chatbots. Across models, we
observe systematic ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative tendencies, which are
not confined to synthetic prompts but also appear in naturalistic dialogue,
indicating that bias dynamics might strengthen in real interactions. Our study
provides a language-aware evaluation framework for Chinese LLMs, demonstrating
that social identity biases documented in English generalize
cross-linguistically and intensify in user-facing contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC) improves legal document retrieval by adding document-level synthetic summaries to text chunks, reducing Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM) and enhancing retrieval precision and recall in RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal document databases often cause retrieval failures due to structural similarity, leading to Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM) where retrievers select information from entirely wrong documents, undermining RAG system reliability.

Method: Proposed Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC) - a simple technique that enhances text chunks with document-level synthetic summaries to provide global context lost in standard chunking. Tested generic summarization vs. legal expert domain knowledge approaches.

Result: SAC significantly reduces DRM and improves text-level retrieval precision and recall. Generic summarization strategy outperformed legal expert domain knowledge approach. Technique is practical, scalable, and easily integrable.

Conclusion: Summary-Augmented Chunking is an effective method to enhance RAG system reliability for large-scale legal document datasets by providing crucial global context through document-level summaries.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its
reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This
is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of
structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this
paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a
critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where
the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To
mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique
which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances
each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting
crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking
process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks
show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level
retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic
summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert
domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence
that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the
reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline to create high-quality multilingual post-training datasets for Indian languages, addressing gaps in existing open-source datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source datasets lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and task diversity, especially for Indian languages, limiting the effectiveness of LLMs in these contexts.

Method: A human-in-the-loop pipeline combining translations with synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training data across 10 Indian languages.

Result: Created two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and Pragyaan-Align (100K) covering 13 broad and 56 sub-categories across 10 Indian languages, leveraging 57 diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The dataset protocol emphasizes task diversity, multi-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and cultural nuance preservation, providing a foundation for more inclusive multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the
availability of high-quality post-training data, particularly
instruction-tuning and preference-based examples. Existing open-source
datasets, however, often lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and
suffer from task diversity gaps that are especially pronounced for Indian
languages. We introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that combines translations
with synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training
data. Using this pipeline, we curate two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and
Pragyaan-Align (100K) across 10 Indian languages covering 13 broad and 56
sub-categories, leveraging 57 diverse datasets. Our dataset protocol
incorporates several often-overlooked dimensions and emphasize task diversity,
multi-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and preservation
of cultural nuance, providing a foundation for more inclusive and effective

### [68] [Native Hybrid Attention for Efficient Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07019)
*Jusen Du,Jiaxi Hu,Tao Zhang,Weigao Sun,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Native Hybrid Attention (NHA) is a hybrid architecture combining linear and full attention that maintains long-term context via linear RNN and augments with short-term tokens from a sliding window, achieving better efficiency and accuracy than Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic complexity while linear attention sacrifices recall accuracy over long contexts. NHA aims to bridge this gap by integrating both attention types efficiently.

Method: NHA uses intra & inter-layer hybridization with linear RNN for long-term context and sliding window for short-term tokens, applying a single softmax attention over all keys/values without extra parameters.

Result: NHA outperforms Transformers and other hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks, and enables pretrained LLMs to achieve competitive accuracy with significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: NHA provides an effective hybrid attention architecture that balances efficiency and accuracy, allowing smooth adjustment between linear and full attention while maintaining structural uniformity.

Abstract: Transformers excel at sequence modeling but face quadratic complexity, while
linear attention offers improved efficiency but often compromises recall
accuracy over long contexts. In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention
(NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates
both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA
maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and
augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single
\texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values,
enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring
additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a
single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment
between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally
uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other
hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks.
Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving
competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains. Code is
available at https://github.com/JusenD/NHA.

TL;DR: Analysis of GPT-4.1's factual knowledge reveals significant differences from established knowledge bases, lower accuracy than benchmarks suggest, and major issues with inconsistency, ambiguity, and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deeply understand the factual knowledge of frontier LLMs, which remains poorly understood and is usually analyzed from biased samples.

Method: Analyzed GPTKB v1.5, a recursively elicited set of 100 million beliefs from GPT-4.1, comparing it against established knowledge bases.

Result: Found significant differences from established knowledge bases, lower accuracy than previous benchmarks indicated, and major issues with inconsistency, ambiguity, and hallucinations.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical limitations in LLM factual knowledge and highlights future research opportunities to address these issues.

Abstract: LLMs are remarkable artifacts that have revolutionized a range of NLP and AI
tasks. A significant contributor is their factual knowledge, which, to date,
remains poorly understood, and is usually analyzed from biased samples. In this
paper, we take a deep tour into the factual knowledge (or beliefs) of a
frontier LLM, based on GPTKB v1.5 (Hu et al., 2025a), a recursively elicited
set of 100 million beliefs of one of the strongest currently available frontier
LLMs, GPT-4.1. We find that the models' factual knowledge differs quite
significantly from established knowledge bases, and that its accuracy is
significantly lower than indicated by previous benchmarks. We also find that
inconsistency, ambiguity and hallucinations are major issues, shedding light on
future research opportunities concerning factual LLM knowledge.

TL;DR: Search-R3 is a novel framework that adapts LLMs to generate search embeddings by leveraging their chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, combining supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and efficient training methods to outperform previous retrieval approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have strong natural language understanding but are underutilized for retrieval tasks. The paper aims to bridge this gap by enabling LLMs to directly generate effective search embeddings through their reasoning process.

Method: Three complementary mechanisms: (1) supervised learning for quality embeddings, (2) reinforcement learning to optimize embedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment that handles evolving embeddings without requiring complete corpus re-encoding at each iteration.

Result: Extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks show that Search-R3 significantly outperforms prior methods by unifying reasoning and embedding generation processes.

Conclusion: The integrated post-training approach represents a substantial advancement for complex knowledge-intensive tasks requiring both sophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been underutilized for retrieval tasks. We present
Search-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to
generate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our
approach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce
more effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic
analyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a
supervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality
embeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes
embedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment
that efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring
complete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration. Our extensive
evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Search-R3 significantly
outperforms prior methods by unifying the reasoning and embedding generation
processes. This integrated post-training approach represents a substantial
advancement in handling complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require both
sophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval. Project page:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sinclair Broadcast Group's acquisition of local news stations leads to increased national news coverage and more polarizing topics, reducing local content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Sinclair's acquisition affects local news coverage, given their trusted status and potential influence on viewers.

Method: Computational analysis of internet content from local news stations before and after Sinclair acquisition, compared to national outlets.

Result: Clear evidence of increased national news coverage and more polarizing topics, with decreased local content.

Conclusion: Sinclair's acquisition shifts local news focus from local to national, more polarizing topics, potentially undermining their role as trusted local sources.

Abstract: Local news stations are often considered to be reliable sources of
non-politicized information, particularly local concerns that residents care
about. Because these stations are trusted news sources, viewers are
particularly susceptible to the information they report. The Sinclair Broadcast
group is a broadcasting company that has acquired many local news stations in
the last decade. We investigate the effects of local news stations being
acquired by Sinclair: how does coverage change? We use computational methods to
investigate changes in internet content put out by local news stations before
and after being acquired by Sinclair and in comparison to national news
outlets. We find that there is clear evidence that local news stations report
more frequently on national news at the expense of local topics, and that their
coverage of polarizing national topics increases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ITEM is a benchmark evaluating 26 automatic metrics across 6 Indian languages, revealing LLM-based evaluators align best with human judgments, outliers significantly impact agreement, and metrics differ in robustness to perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic metrics are developed mainly for high-resource languages like English, leaving Indian languages (spoken by 1.5B+ people) overlooked, questioning the universality of current evaluation practices.

Method: Created ITEM benchmark with fine-grained annotations to systematically evaluate metric-human alignment across 6 Indian languages, covering agreement, outlier sensitivity, language-specific reliability, inter-metric correlations, and resilience to perturbations.

Result: Four key findings: (1) LLM-based evaluators show strongest human alignment; (2) outliers significantly impact metric-human agreement; (3) TS metrics better capture content fidelity, MT metrics better reflect fluency; (4) metrics differ in robustness to perturbations.

Conclusion: Provides critical guidance for advancing metric design and evaluation in Indian languages, addressing the gap in multilingual evaluation practices.

Abstract: While automatic metrics drive progress in Machine Translation (MT) and Text
Summarization (TS), existing metrics have been developed and validated almost
exclusively for English and other high-resource languages. This narrow focus
leaves Indian languages, spoken by over 1.5 billion people, largely overlooked,
casting doubt on the universality of current evaluation practices. To address
this gap, we introduce ITEM, a large-scale benchmark that systematically
evaluates the alignment of 26 automatic metrics with human judgments across six
major Indian languages, enriched with fine-grained annotations. Our extensive
evaluation, covering agreement with human judgments, sensitivity to outliers,
language-specific reliability, inter-metric correlations, and resilience to
controlled perturbations, reveals four central findings: (1) LLM-based
evaluators show the strongest alignment with human judgments at both segment
and system levels; (2) outliers exert a significant impact on metric-human
agreement; (3) in TS, metrics are more effective at capturing content fidelity,
whereas in MT, they better reflect fluency; and (4) metrics differ in their
robustness and sensitivity when subjected to diverse perturbations.
Collectively, these findings offer critical guidance for advancing metric
design and evaluation in Indian languages.

Motivation: Low-resource languages like Luxembourgish lack high-quality instruction datasets, and traditional machine translation introduces semantic misalignment and cultural inaccuracies.

Method: Created cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish by leveraging aligned data from English, French, and German, without using machine-generated translations into Luxembourgish.

Result: Cross-lingual instruction tuning improves representational alignment across languages and enhances the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual data curation avoids pitfalls of machine-translated data and directly benefits low-resource language development.

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a key technique for enhancing the performance
of large language models, enabling them to better follow human prompts.
However, low-resource languages such as Luxembourgish face severe limitations
due to the lack of high-quality instruction datasets. Traditional reliance on
machine translation often introduces semantic misalignment and cultural
inaccuracies. In this work, we address these challenges by creating a
cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish, without resorting
to machine-generated translations into it. Instead, by leveraging aligned data
from English, French, and German, we build a high-quality dataset that
preserves linguistic and cultural nuances. We provide evidence that
cross-lingual instruction tuning not only improves representational alignment
across languages but also the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish.
This highlights how cross-lingual data curation can avoid the common pitfalls
of machine-translated data and directly benefit low-resource language
development.

### [75] [Accelerating Diffusion LLM Inference via Local Determinism Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07081)
*Fanheng Kong,Jingyuan Zhang,Yahui Liu,Zirui Wu,Yu Tian,Victoria W.,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LocalLeap is a training-free adaptive parallel decoding strategy for diffusion LLMs that achieves 6.94× throughput improvement by reducing decoding steps to 14.2% of original requirements through local determinism propagation and progressive spatial consistency decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source diffusion LLM implementations suffer from quality-speed trade-offs where conservative sampling strategies (greedy decoding) cause delayed decoding - repeated redundant refinement iterations that reduce inference efficiency.

Method: LocalLeap identifies high-confidence anchors and performs localized relaxed parallel decoding within bounded neighborhoods using two principles: local determinism propagation and progressive spatial consistency decay, enabling early commitment of already-determined tokens.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows 6.94× throughput improvements and reduction of decoding steps to just 14.2% of original requirements, with negligible performance impact on output quality.

Conclusion: LocalLeap effectively addresses the delayed decoding problem in diffusion LLMs through adaptive parallel decoding, achieving substantial efficiency gains without compromising quality, making dLLMs more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) represent a significant advancement
in text generation, offering parallel token decoding capabilities. However,
existing open-source implementations suffer from quality-speed trade-offs that
impede their practical deployment. Conservative sampling strategies typically
decode only the most confident token per step to ensure quality (i.e., greedy
decoding), at the cost of inference efficiency due to repeated redundant
refinement iterations--a phenomenon we term delayed decoding. Through
systematic analysis of dLLM decoding dynamics, we characterize this delayed
decoding behavior and propose a training-free adaptive parallel decoding
strategy, named LocalLeap, to address these inefficiencies. LocalLeap is built
on two fundamental empirical principles: local determinism propagation centered
on high-confidence anchors and progressive spatial consistency decay. By
applying these principles, LocalLeap identifies anchors and performs localized
relaxed parallel decoding within bounded neighborhoods, achieving substantial
inference step reduction through early commitment of already-determined tokens
without compromising output quality. Comprehensive evaluation on various
benchmarks demonstrates that LocalLeap achieves 6.94$\times$ throughput
improvements and reduces decoding steps to just 14.2\% of the original
requirement, achieving these gains with negligible performance impact. The

*Miriam Wanner,Leif Azzopardi,Paul Thomas,Soham Dan,Benjamin Van Durme,Nick Craswell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VITAL metrics and VITALERRORS benchmark to address the limitation of existing factuality evaluation methods that treat all claims equally, making them insensitive to errors in key information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLM factuality treat all claims as equally important, leading to misleading evaluations when vital information is missing or incorrect. Current approaches are insensitive to omitted or false key information.

Method: Constructed VITALERRORS benchmark with 6,733 queries containing minimally altered LLM responses designed to omit or falsify key information. Introduced VITAL metrics that incorporate relevance and importance of claims with respect to the query.

Result: Demonstrated the insensitivities of existing evaluation metrics to key information errors. Showed that VITAL metrics more reliably detect errors in key information than previous methods.

Conclusion: The VITAL metrics, benchmark, and analysis provide a foundation for more accurate and robust assessment of LLM factuality by addressing the sensitivity gap in detecting errors in vital information.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the factuality of large language model (LLM)
responses treat all claims as equally important. This results in misleading
evaluations when vital information is missing or incorrect as it receives the
same weight as peripheral details, raising the question: how can we reliably
detect such differences when there are errors in key information? Current
approaches that measure factuality tend to be insensitive to omitted or false
key information. To investigate this lack of sensitivity, we construct
VITALERRORS, a benchmark of 6,733 queries with minimally altered LLM responses
designed to omit or falsify key information. Using this dataset, we demonstrate
the insensitivities of existing evaluation metrics to key information errors.
To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a set of metrics that provide greater
sensitivity in measuring the factuality of responses by incorporating the
relevance and importance of claims with respect to the query. Our analysis
demonstrates that VITAL metrics more reliably detect errors in key information
than previous methods. Our dataset, metrics, and analysis provide a foundation
for more accurate and robust assessment of LLM factuality.

*Zhu Li,Yuqing Zhang,Xiyuan Gao,Shekhar Nayak,Matt Coler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis combining semantic embeddings from fine-tuned LLaMA 3 and prosodic exemplars via RAG, integrated with VITS backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm poses challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic, contextual, and prosodic cues, and remains largely unexplored compared to broad emotional categories.

Method: Dual conditioning approach: (1) semantic embeddings from LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3 capturing pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues, (2) prosodic exemplars retrieved via RAG module providing expressive reference patterns, integrated within VITS backbone.

Result: Outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations, with improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and downstream sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables more natural and contextually appropriate sarcastic speech synthesis by effectively combining semantic and prosodic cues through LLM enhancement and retrieval augmentation.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant
challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic,
contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has
focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach
combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture
pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic
exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which
provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within
a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually
appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations,
yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and
downstream sarcasm detection.

*Guo Yutong,Wanying Wang,Yue Wu,Zichen Miao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TALENT is a lightweight framework that uses a small VLM for OCR and natural language narration, then combines them with questions for LLM reasoning, achieving comparable performance to large VLMs at lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs miss fine-grained details and are computationally prohibitive for mobile deployment, while existing OCR+LLM approaches using structured representations introduce substantial errors.

Method: TALENT uses dual representations - OCR text and natural language narration from a small VLM, which are combined with questions for reasoning by an LLM, reframing Table VQA as LLM-centric multimodal reasoning.

Result: TALENT enables small VLM-LLM combinations to match or surpass single large VLMs at significantly lower computational cost on both public datasets and the new ReTabVQA dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reframes Table VQA as LLM-centric multimodal reasoning, making it more efficient and effective for deployment, especially on mobile devices.

Abstract: Table Visual Question Answering (Table VQA) is typically addressed by large
vision-language models (VLMs). While such models can answer directly from
images, they often miss fine-grained details unless scaled to very large sizes,
which are computationally prohibitive, especially for mobile deployment. A
lighter alternative is to have a small VLM perform OCR and then use a large
language model (LLM) to reason over structured outputs such as Markdown tables.
However, these representations are not naturally optimized for LLMs and still
introduce substantial errors. We propose TALENT (Table VQA via Augmented
Language-Enhanced Natural-text Transcription), a lightweight framework that
leverages dual representations of tables. TALENT prompts a small VLM to produce
both OCR text and natural language narration, then combines them with the
question for reasoning by an LLM. This reframes Table VQA as an LLM-centric
multimodal reasoning task, where the VLM serves as a perception-narration
module rather than a monolithic solver. Additionally, we construct ReTabVQA, a
more challenging Table VQA dataset requiring multi-step quantitative reasoning
over table images. Experiments show that TALENT enables a small VLM-LLM
combination to match or surpass a single large VLM at significantly lower
computational cost on both public datasets and ReTabVQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system for modeling human variation in NLP tasks using LLMs' in-context learning with two-step meta-learning, winning the LeWiDi competition and showing importance of rater examples and model scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many NLP tasks involve subjectivity, ambiguity, or legitimate disagreement between annotators, requiring systems that can model human variation.

Method: Leverages LLMs' in-context learning with two-step meta-learning: 1) post-training on many in-context learning datasets, 2) specializing via in-context meta-learning to specific data distributions.

Result: Won the Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) competition on both tasks. Ablation study showed rater examples in-context are crucial, dataset-specific fine-tuning helps on larger datasets, post-training helps on one competition dataset, and performance improves with model scale.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively models human variation in NLP tasks through strategic use of in-context learning and meta-learning, demonstrating the importance of incorporating rater perspectives and scaling model capabilities.

Abstract: Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks involve subjectivity, ambiguity,
or legitimate disagreement between annotators. In this paper, we outline our
system for modeling human variation. Our system leverages language models'
(LLMs) in-context learning abilities, along with a two-step meta-learning
training procedure for 1) post-training on many datasets requiring in-context
learning and 2) specializing the model via in-context meta-learning to the
particular data distribution of interest. We also evaluate the performance of
our system submission to the Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) competition,
where it was the overall winner on both tasks. Additionally, we perform an
ablation study to measure the importance of each system component. We find that
including rater examples in-context is crucial for our system's performance,
dataset-specific fine-tuning is helpful on the larger datasets, post-training
on other in-context datasets is helpful on one of the competition datasets, and
that performance improves with model scale.

### [80] [TRIM: Token-wise Attention-Derived Saliency for Data-Efficient Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07118)
*Manish Nagaraj,Sakshi Choudhary,Utkarsh Saxena,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRIM is a forward-only, token-centric framework that uses attention-based fingerprints instead of gradients to select high-quality coresets for instruction tuning, achieving better performance than full-data fine-tuning in some cases with much lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coreset selection methods for instruction tuning are computationally expensive (relying on gradients) and overlook fine-grained features, making it challenging to curate small, high-quality subsets that can deliver comparable or superior results to large datasets.

Method: TRIM operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via attention-based "fingerprints" from a handful of target samples, using a forward-only, token-centric framework without requiring gradients.

Result: Coresets selected by TRIM consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even surpass full-data fine-tuning performance in some settings, while achieving this at a fraction of the computational cost by avoiding expensive backward passes.

Conclusion: TRIM establishes itself as a scalable and efficient alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets, offering superior performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks and commonly relies on large, diverse corpora. However, small,
high-quality subsets, known as coresets, can deliver comparable or superior
results, though curating them remains challenging. Existing methods often rely
on coarse, sample-level signals like gradients, an approach that is
computationally expensive and overlooks fine-grained features. To address this,
we introduce TRIM (Token Relevance via Interpretable Multi-layer Attention), a
forward-only, token-centric framework. Instead of using gradients, TRIM
operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via
attention-based "fingerprints" from a handful of target samples. Such an
approach makes TRIM highly efficient and uniquely sensitive to the structural
features that define a task. Coresets selected by our method consistently
outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even
surpass the performance of full-data fine-tuning in some settings. By avoiding
expensive backward passes, TRIM achieves this at a fraction of the
computational cost. These findings establish TRIM as a scalable and efficient
alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with garden path sentences and show varying similarity to human sentence comprehension patterns depending on model size and capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs experience human-like processing difficulties in sentence comprehension, particularly across challenging linguistic structures.

Method: Systematic comparison of human and LLM sentence comprehension across seven challenging linguistic structures using unified experimental framework with five families of state-of-the-art LLMs varying in size and training procedures.

Result: LLMs overall struggle on target structures, especially garden path sentences (46.8% accuracy for GPT-5 vs 93.7% on non-GP structures). Rank correlation between humans and models increases with parameter count. Performance gap patterns similar to humans except for very weak or very strong models.

Conclusion: Reveals both convergence and divergence in human and LLM sentence comprehension, offering insights into the similarity between humans and LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that fluently converse with humans are a reality
- but do LLMs experience human-like processing difficulties? We systematically
compare human and LLM sentence comprehension across seven challenging
linguistic structures. We collect sentence comprehension data from humans and
five families of state-of-the-art LLMs, varying in size and training procedure
in a unified experimental framework. Our results show LLMs overall struggle on
the target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed,
while the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures
(93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5).
Additionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank
correlation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each
target structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the
difficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline
sentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two
exceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across
both sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is
uniformly high. Together, these reveal convergence and divergence in human and
LLM sentence comprehension, offering new insights into the similarity of humans
and LLMs.

*Lekang Jiang,Wenjun Sun,Stephan Goetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RHC reformulates hierarchical text classification as a step-by-step reasoning task using LLMs, achieving better performance and explainability than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated patent classification is challenging due to domain complexity and large label sets. Previous approaches provide flat predictions without reasoning insights.

Method: Two-stage training: cold-start alignment with chain-of-thought reasoning format, followed by reinforcement learning to enhance multi-step reasoning ability.

Result: RHC outperforms baselines by ~3% in accuracy and macro F1, provides natural-language justifications, scales well with model size, and achieves SOTA on other HTC benchmarks.

Conclusion: RHC is an effective, explainable, scalable framework for hierarchical text classification with broad applicability beyond patent classification.

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) assigns documents to multiple levels
of a pre-defined taxonomy. Automated patent subject classification represents
one of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a
huge number of labels. Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which
offers little insight into the reason behind predictions. Therefore, we propose
Reasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that
reformulates HTC as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce
hierarchical labels. RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a
cold-start stage that aligns outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
format and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning
ability. RHC demonstrates four advantages in our experiments. (1)
Effectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms the supervised
fine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro F1. (2)
Explainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction
to facilitate human inspection. (3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with
model size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. (4)
Applicability: Beyond patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which
highlights its broad applicability.

Motivation: LLM reasoning capabilities depend heavily on training data quality, but practical utility of various data construction methods in real-world pipelines remains underexplored.

Method: Conducted unified analysis of open-source datasets and data synthesis techniques for mathematical reasoning using a pipeline mirroring real training and deployment scenarios.

Result: Found that structuring data in interpretable formats and distilling from stronger models often outweighs simply scaling up data volume. Identified effective data selection strategies for industrial applications.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidance for integrating training data to enhance LLM capabilities, supporting cost-effective data curation and scalable model enhancement. Highlights need to balance 'more data' versus 'better data' for real-world reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a critical
role in many downstream tasks, yet depend strongly on the quality of training
data. Despite various proposed data construction methods, their practical
utility in real-world pipelines remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct
a comprehensive analysis of open-source datasets and data synthesis techniques
for mathematical reasoning, evaluating them under a unified pipeline designed
to mirror training and deployment scenarios. We further distill effective data
selection strategies and identify practical methods suitable for industrial
applications. Our findings highlight that structuring data in more
interpretable formats, or distilling from stronger models often outweighs
simply scaling up data volume. This study provides actionable guidance for
integrating training data to enhance LLM capabilities, supporting both
cost-effective data curation and scalable model enhancement. We hope this work
will inspire further research on how to balance "more data" versus "better
data" for real-world reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Specialized LLMs like NurseLLM are crucial for nursing domain applications, with reasoning and multi-agent collaboration systems showing promise for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
transformed medical systems. However, their potential within specialized
domains such as nursing remains largely underexplored. In this work, we
introduce NurseLLM, the first nursing-specialized LLM tailored for multiple

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to systematically measure data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, finding that popular inventories like BFI-44 and PVQ-40 show strong contamination where models memorize items and can adjust responses to achieve target scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work raised concerns about data contamination from psychometric inventories in LLM evaluations, but there was no systematic attempt to quantify this contamination, which threatens the reliability of psychological assessments of LLMs.

Method: Proposed a framework to measure data contamination in three aspects: item memorization, evaluation memorization, and target score matching. Applied this to 21 models from major families and four widely used psychometric inventories.

Result: Found that popular inventories like Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40) exhibit strong contamination - models not only memorize items but can also adjust responses to achieve specific target scores.

Conclusion: Data contamination is a significant issue in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, compromising the reliability of assessments of psychological constructs like values, personality, and moral foundations.

Abstract: Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models
(LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values,
personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised
concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which
may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic
attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in
psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item
memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching.
Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used
psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as
the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40)
exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also
adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.

*Yong-En Tian,Yu-Chien Tang,An-Zi Yen,Wen-Chih Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARPAS, a new task for content-aware refinement of provided aspects in aspect-based summarization, addressing the issue of incomplete or irrelevant predefined aspects in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aspect-based summarization approaches assume predefined aspects, but real-world scenarios often present incomplete, irrelevant, or missing aspects that need adaptive refinement based on document content.

Method: Proposed CARPAS task with three new datasets, used LLMs with four prompting strategies, and introduced a preliminary subtask to predict the number of relevant aspects to guide LLMs in focusing on pertinent aspects.

Result: LLMs tend to predict overly comprehensive aspect sets leading to long, misaligned summaries. Using predicted aspect numbers as guidance significantly improves performance across all datasets and reduces inference difficulty.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses aspect refinement challenges, and deeper analysis reveals LLMs' compliance when requested aspect numbers differ from their estimations, providing crucial insights for real-world LLM deployment.

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization has attracted significant attention for its
ability to generate more fine-grained and user-aligned summaries. While most
existing approaches assume a set of predefined aspects as input, real-world
scenarios often present challenges where these given aspects may be incomplete,
irrelevant, or entirely missing from the document. Users frequently expect
systems to adaptively refine or filter the provided aspects based on the actual
content. In this paper, we initiate this novel task setting, termed
Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization (CARPAS), with
the aim of dynamically adjusting the provided aspects based on the document
context before summarizing. We construct three new datasets to facilitate our
pilot experiments, and by using LLMs with four representative prompting
strategies in this task, we find that LLMs tend to predict an overly
comprehensive set of aspects, which often results in excessively long and
misaligned summaries. Building on this observation, we propose a preliminary
subtask to predict the number of relevant aspects, and demonstrate that the
predicted number can serve as effective guidance for the LLMs, reducing the
inference difficulty, and enabling them to focus on the most pertinent aspects.
Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly
improves performance across all datasets. Moreover, our deeper analyses uncover
LLMs' compliance when the requested number of aspects differs from their own
estimations, establishing a crucial insight for the deployment of LLMs in
similar real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-2 don't distinguish between humanly possible and impossible languages, suggesting they lack human innate linguistic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether large language models share the same innate learning biases as humans regarding possible vs impossible languages.

Method: Compared GPT-2 learning curves on natural languages and their impossible counterparts created via perturbations, and analyzed cross-linguistic variance in perplexity metrics.

Result: GPT-2 learns natural languages and their impossible counterparts equally easily, showing no systematic separation between possible and impossible languages.

Conclusion: LLMs do not share the human innate biases that shape linguistic typology.

Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) sensitive to the distinction between humanly
possible languages and humanly impossible languages? This question is taken by
many to bear on whether LLMs and humans share the same innate learning biases.
Previous work has attempted to answer it in the positive by comparing LLM
learning curves on existing language datasets and on "impossible" datasets
derived from them via various perturbation functions. Using the same
methodology, we examine this claim on a wider set of languages and impossible
perturbations. We find that in most cases, GPT-2 learns each language and its
impossible counterpart equally easily, in contrast to previous claims. We also
apply a more lenient condition by testing whether GPT-2 provides any kind of
separation between the whole set of natural languages and the whole set of
impossible languages. By considering cross-linguistic variance in various
metrics computed on the perplexity curves, we show that GPT-2 provides no
systematic separation between the possible and the impossible. Taken together,
these perspectives show that LLMs do not share the human innate biases that
shape linguistic typology.

TL;DR: Sunflower 14B and 32B models developed for Uganda's diverse languages, based on Qwen 3, offering state-of-the-art comprehension across most Ugandan languages to address language technology gaps in Africa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most of Africa's 2000+ languages lack language technology support, with current LLMs prioritizing only the most common languages, leaving many African languages underserved.

Method: Developed regionally focused models (Sunflower 14B and 32B) based on Qwen 3 architecture, specifically targeting Uganda's high linguistic diversity.

Result: Created open source models with state-of-the-art comprehension in the majority of Ugandan languages, reducing language barriers in practical applications.

Conclusion: A regionally focused approach is more efficient for addressing language technology gaps in Africa's diverse linguistic landscape, as demonstrated by the successful Uganda case study.

Abstract: There are more than 2000 living languages in Africa, most of which have been
bypassed by advances in language technology. Current leading LLMs exhibit
strong performance on a number of the most common languages (e.g. Swahili or
Yoruba), but prioritise support for the languages with the most speakers first,
resulting in piecemeal ability across disparate languages. We contend that a
regionally focussed approach is more efficient, and present a case study for
Uganda, a country with high linguistic diversity. We describe the development
of Sunflower 14B and 32B, a pair of models based on Qwen 3 with state of the
art comprehension in the majority of all Ugandan languages. These models are
open source and can be used to reduce language barriers in a number of
important practical applications.

TL;DR: A training-free method to identify and manipulate sparse dimensions in LLMs that control cross-lingual transitions, enabling language switching while preserving semantics with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities despite limited non-English data, mapping multilingual content into English-aligned representations and projecting them back to target languages.

Method: Identify and manipulate sparse dimensions at consistent indices across intermediate to final layers using only 50 sentences of parallel or monolingual data, without training.

Result: The method can switch output language while preserving semantic content and outperforms prior neuron-based approaches at substantially lower cost.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual transitions in LLMs are governed by small, sparse dimensions that can be effectively manipulated for multilingual generation control.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities despite
limited exposure to non-English data. Prior studies show that English-centric
large language models map multilingual content into English-aligned
representations at intermediate layers and then project them back into
target-language token spaces in the final layer. From this observation, we
hypothesize that this cross-lingual transition is governed by a small and
sparse set of dimensions, which occur at consistent indices across the
intermediate to final layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple,
training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring
only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments
on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these
dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch
the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses
the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost.

*Benjamin Akera,Evelyn Nafula,Patrick Walukagga,Gilbert Yiga,John Quinn,Ernest Mwebaze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Whisper achieves practical ASR performance (WER < 13%) with just 50 hours of training data for low-resource African languages, with data quality issues accounting for 38.6% of high-error cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing ASR systems for low-resource African languages with limited transcribed speech data, and to provide practical deployment guidance on minimum data requirements and failure modes.

Method: Comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages: systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda (1-1,400 hours training data) and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu (270 hours training data) using Whisper model.

Result: Practical ASR performance (WER < 13%) achievable with 50 hours of data, substantial improvements through 200 hours (WER < 10%). Data quality issues (noisy ground truth transcriptions) account for 38.6% of high-error cases.

Conclusion: Careful data curation is as critical as data volume for robust ASR performance in low-resource contexts. Results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for similar language contexts.

Abstract: The development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for
low-resource African languages remains challenging due to limited transcribed
speech data. While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI's
Whisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, critical
questions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paper
addresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimum
data volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primary
failure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper's
performance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages:
systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to
1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours of
training data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASR
performance (WER < 13\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours of
training data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER
< 10\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysis
reveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truth
transcriptions, account for 38.6\% of high-error cases, indicating that careful
data curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance.
These results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teams
developing ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts. We

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for efficient pretraining of Small Language Models (SLMs) using sparse sub-network initializations, evolutionary search, and knowledge distillation to achieve comparable performance with significantly fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make language model development more accessible by creating efficient SLMs that deliver strong performance while using far fewer resources than LLMs.

Method: Three complementary approaches: 1) structurally sparse sub-network initializations, 2) evolutionary search for discovering high-quality initializations, 3) knowledge distillation from larger teacher models.

Result: The best model matches validation perplexity of comparable Pythia SLM while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining tokens, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical and reproducible path for cost-efficient small language model development at scale, with all code and models publicly released.

Abstract: Small Language models (SLMs) offer an efficient and accessible alternative to
Large Language Models (LLMs), delivering strong performance while using far
fewer resources. We introduce a simple and effective framework for pretraining
SLMs that brings together three complementary ideas. First, we identify
structurally sparse sub-network initializations that consistently outperform
randomly initialized models of similar size under the same compute budget.
Second, we use evolutionary search to automatically discover high-quality
sub-network initializations, providing better starting points for pretraining.
Third, we apply knowledge distillation from larger teacher models to speed up
training and improve generalization. Together, these components make SLM
pretraining substantially more efficient: our best model, discovered using
evolutionary search and initialized with LLM weights, matches the validation
perplexity of a comparable Pythia SLM while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining
tokens. We release all code and models at
https://github.com/whittle-org/whittle/, offering a practical and reproducible
path toward cost-efficient small language model development at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Customer-R1 is an RL-based method that enables LLMs to simulate personalized user behavior in online shopping by conditioning on explicit personas and optimizing next-step rationale and action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for simulating step-wise human behavior with LLMs learn population-level policies without user personas, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with policy conditioned on explicit persona, optimizing next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals.

Result: Significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks and better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.

Conclusion: Customer-R1 enables more accurate personalized user behavior simulation in online shopping environments compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has
become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various
practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in
modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy
without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than
personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can
LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce
Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior
simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an
explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via
action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate
that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based
baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users'
action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior
simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new causal reasoning benchmark for LLMs using real-world economic/finance data shows current models struggle significantly, with best performance at only 57.6% accuracy despite using rigorous causal identification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal reasoning benchmarks rely on synthetic data and have narrow domain coverage, limiting their ability to assess LLMs' genuine understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.

Method: Constructed benchmark from causally identified relationships extracted from top economics/finance journals using rigorous methodologies including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs.

Result: Evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art LLMs on 40,379 items across 5 task types revealed substantial limitations - best model achieved only 57.6% accuracy. Model scale doesn't consistently improve performance, and advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal identification.

Conclusion: There's a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the demands of reliable causal reasoning needed for high-stakes applications, highlighting the need for improved causal reasoning abilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to
understand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching.
Existing benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on
synthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark
constructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier
economics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including
instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity
designs. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task
types across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture.
Experimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial
limitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\% accuracy. Moreover,
model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even
advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship
identification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM
capabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAD-RAG is a Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework that improves question answering over visually rich documents by preserving structural and cross-page dependencies through symbolic document graphs and dynamic retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG methods lose structural and cross-page dependencies when encoding content in isolated chunks, leading to incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks.

Method: Constructs a symbolic document graph during ingestion to capture layout structure and cross-page dependencies, and uses an LLM agent during inference to dynamically interact with neural and symbolic indices for adaptive evidence retrieval.

Result: Achieves over 90% perfect recall on average without top-k tuning, outperforms baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, and yields higher QA accuracy with minimal latency across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: LAD-RAG effectively addresses limitations of conventional RAG by preserving document structure and enabling dynamic retrieval, significantly improving performance on multi-page reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Question answering over visually rich documents (VRDs) requires reasoning not
only over isolated content but also over documents' structural organization and
cross-page dependencies. However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing
structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at
inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This
often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for
multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a
novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs
a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page
dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more
holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent
dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively
retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on
MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG
improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any
top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at
comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.

TL;DR: Systematic investigation reveals that popular factuality benchmarks for LLMs are outdated, leading to unreliable assessments due to temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static nature of widely used evaluation benchmarks cannot keep pace with the rapid evolution of LLMs and real-world facts, raising concerns about their reliability for evaluating LLM factuality.

Method: Examined five popular factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs across different years using an up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three tailored metrics to quantify benchmark aging and its impact.

Result: A considerable portion of samples in widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable assessments of LLM factuality.

Conclusion: The work provides a testbed to assess benchmark reliability and aims to inspire more research on the benchmark aging issue in LLM factuality evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and the real world has
outpaced the static nature of widely used evaluation benchmarks, raising
concerns about their reliability for evaluating LLM factuality. While
substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their
temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects
on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we
present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular
factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An
up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify
benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental
results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the
widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable
assessments of LLM factuality. We hope our work can provide a testbed to assess
the reliability of a benchmark for LLM factuality evaluation and inspire more
research on the benchmark aging issue. Codes are available in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Red-Bandit is an adaptive red-teaming framework that uses LoRA experts specialized in different attack styles and a multi-armed bandit policy to dynamically select attacks based on target model responses, achieving state-of-the-art results while producing human-readable prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated red-teaming approaches lack mechanisms to efficiently adapt to model-specific vulnerabilities at inference time, limiting their effectiveness in identifying and exploiting unique failure modes of different LLMs.

Method: Post-trains parameter-efficient LoRA experts specialized for different attack styles using reinforcement learning with rule-based safety model rewards. Uses multi-armed bandit policy to dynamically select among attack-style experts based on target model's response safety.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on AdvBench (ASR@10) with sufficient exploration, produces more human-readable prompts (lower perplexity), and serves as diagnostic tool for uncovering model-specific vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Red-Bandit provides an effective adaptive framework for automated red-teaming that balances exploration and exploitation while identifying model-specific failure modes through different attack styles.

Abstract: Automated red-teaming has emerged as a scalable approach for auditing Large
Language Models (LLMs) prior to deployment, yet existing approaches lack
mechanisms to efficiently adapt to model-specific vulnerabilities at inference.
We introduce Red-Bandit, a red-teaming framework that adapts online to identify
and exploit model failure modes under distinct attack styles (e.g.,
manipulation, slang). Red-Bandit post-trains a set of parameter-efficient LoRA
experts, each specialized for a particular attack style, using reinforcement
learning that rewards the generation of unsafe prompts via a rule-based safety
model. At inference, a multi-armed bandit policy dynamically selects among
these attack-style experts based on the target model's response safety,
balancing exploration and exploitation. Red-Bandit achieves state-of-the-art
results on AdvBench under sufficient exploration (ASR@10), while producing more
human-readable prompts (lower perplexity). Moreover, Red-Bandit's bandit policy
serves as a diagnostic tool for uncovering model-specific vulnerabilities by
indicating which attack styles most effectively elicit unsafe behaviors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HERO is a reinforcement learning framework that combines binary verifier signals with continuous reward model scores using stratified normalization and variance-aware weighting to improve reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary verifier feedback (0-1 correctness) is brittle and under-credits partially correct or alternative answers, limiting learning. Reward models offer richer continuous feedback but need integration with verifiers for better reasoning supervision.

Method: HERO uses hybrid ensemble reward optimization with stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within verifier-defined groups, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts where dense signals matter most.

Result: HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks.

Conclusion: Hybrid reward design retains verifier stability while leveraging reward model nuance to advance reasoning, showing that combining both signal types is effective for LLM reasoning improvement.

Abstract: Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly
relies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1
correctness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many
tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers
under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning.
Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a
complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid
Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO
employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within
verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality
distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts
where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,
with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show
that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging
the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel reference-free evaluation method for LLM outputs in legal domains using 'Legal Data Points' (LDPs) - self-contained information units that better align with how lawyers evaluate legal answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods in legal domains are limited by dependence on costly reference data or standardized assessments that don't reflect legal industry practices, leading to unreliable and variable results.

Method: Break down lengthy legal responses into Legal Data Points (LDPs) and develop a reference-free evaluation methodology that mimics how legal experts assess answers, improving correlation with human evaluations.

Result: The method outperforms various baselines on proprietary and LegalBench datasets, shows higher correlation with human expert evaluations, and improves inter-annotator agreement among legal professionals.

Conclusion: The proposed Legal Data Points approach provides a more reliable and effective way to evaluate LLM outputs in legal contexts, with the authors open-sourcing their LDPs to enable community replication and advancement of legal LLM evaluation research.

Abstract: Evaluating large language model (LLM) outputs in the legal domain presents
unique challenges due to the complex and nuanced nature of legal analysis.
Current evaluation approaches either depend on reference data, which is costly
to produce, or use standardized assessment methods, both of which have
significant limitations for legal applications.
  Although LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising evaluation technique, its
reliability and effectiveness in legal contexts depend heavily on evaluation
processes unique to the legal industry and how trustworthy the evaluation
appears to the human legal expert. This is where existing evaluation methods
currently fail and exhibit considerable variability.
  This paper aims to close the gap: a) we break down lengthy responses into
'Legal Data Points' (LDPs), self-contained units of information, and introduce
a novel, reference-free evaluation methodology that reflects how lawyers
evaluate legal answers; b) we demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety
of baselines on both our proprietary dataset and an open-source dataset
(LegalBench); c) we show how our method correlates more closely with human
expert evaluations and helps improve inter-annotator agreement; and finally d)
we open source our Legal Data Points for a subset of LegalBench used in our
experiments, allowing the research community to replicate our results and
advance research in this vital area of LLM evaluation on legal
question-answering.

TL;DR: PA-Tool is a training-free method that adapts tool schemas to align with small language models' pretrained knowledge, reducing schema misalignment errors by 80% and improving tool-use performance by up to 17 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models struggle with tool-use tasks due to schema misalignment, where they hallucinate plausible but non-existent tool names based on pretraining conventions rather than the provided tool schema.

Method: PA-Tool leverages peakedness (a signal from contamination detection) to automatically rename tool components by generating multiple candidates and selecting those with highest output concentration across samples, identifying pretrain-aligned naming patterns.

Result: Experiments on MetaTool and RoTBench show improvements of up to 17% points, with schema misalignment errors reduced by 80%, enabling small models to approach state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Schema-level interventions can unlock the tool-use potential of resource-efficient models by adapting schemas to models rather than models to schemas, maintaining computational efficiency for adaptation to new tools without retraining.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer significant computational advantages for
tool-augmented AI systems, yet they struggle with tool-use tasks, particularly
in selecting appropriate tools and identifying correct parameters. A common
failure mode is schema misalignment: models hallucinate plausible but
non-existent tool names that reflect naming conventions internalized during
pretraining but absent from the provided tool schema. Rather than forcing
models to adapt to arbitrary schemas, we propose adapting schemas to align with
models' pretrained knowledge. We introduce PA-Tool (Pretraining-Aligned Tool
Schema Generation), a training-free method that leverages peakedness-a signal
from contamination detection indicating pretraining familiarity-to
automatically rename tool components. By generating multiple candidates and
selecting those with highest output concentration across samples, PA-Tool
identifies pretrain-aligned naming patterns. Experiments on MetaTool and
RoTBench show improvements of up to 17% points, with schema misalignment errors
reduced by 80%. PA-Tool enables small models to approach state-of-the-art
performance while maintaining computational efficiency for adaptation to new
tools without retraining. Our work demonstrates that schema-level interventions
can unlock the tool-use potential of resource-efficient models by adapting
schemas to models rather than models to schemas.

TL;DR: OnlineRubrics is a method that dynamically updates evaluation criteria during LLM training through pairwise comparisons, addressing limitations of static rubrics and improving performance by up to 8% across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static rubrics in LLM training are vulnerable to reward hacking and fail to capture emergent requirements during training, limiting their effectiveness for open-ended long-form answers.

Method: Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics) dynamically curates evaluation criteria through pairwise comparisons of responses from current and reference policies, enabling continuous error identification and mitigation.

Result: The approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over training with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard, and expert question validation sets.

Conclusion: Dynamic rubric elicitation through pairwise comparisons effectively identifies and mitigates training errors, with qualitative analysis revealing important criteria like transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

Abstract: Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers
where verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide
coarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based
rewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing
approaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such
static rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and
fail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce
Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates
evaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of
responses from current and reference policies. This online process enables
continuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds.
Empirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over
training exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as
well as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively
analyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as
transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can improve their own responses through self-correction, particularly in moral contexts, where repeated self-correction instructions activate and stabilize moral concepts, leading to performance convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how and why intrinsic self-correction works in LLMs, specifically focusing on moral self-correction, as empirical success exists but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.

Method: Mechanistic analysis of moral self-correction in LLMs through multi-round interactions, examining how self-correction instructions activate moral concepts and reduce model uncertainty.

Result: Consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral concepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the activated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds.

Conclusion: Moral self-correction exhibits a desirable property of converged performance, demonstrating strong potential for LLM self-improvement in ethical contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when
instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions
provide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about
potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to
improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.
The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various
applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on
moral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic
self-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and
provide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our
experimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of
convergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral
concepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the
activated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper
demonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it
exhibits a desirable property of converged performance.

TL;DR: M-Thinker addresses language inconsistency and poor reasoning in non-English languages for Large Reasoning Models by using GRPO training with Language Consistency and Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs struggle with maintaining input-output language consistency and perform poorly with wrong reasoning paths in non-English languages, degrading user experience and hindering global deployment.

Method: Proposes M-Thinker trained with GRPO algorithm using Language Consistency reward for input-thought-answer consistency and Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment reward to transfer English reasoning capability to other languages.

Result: M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models achieve nearly 100% language consistency, superior performance on MMATH and PolyMath benchmarks, and excellent generalization to out-of-domain languages.

Conclusion: M-Thinker effectively solves language inconsistency and reasoning transfer problems in non-English LRMs through innovative reward mechanisms, enabling better global deployment.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
reasoning tasks by adopting the "think-then-answer" paradigm, which enhances
both accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical
limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to
maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly
with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These
limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers
and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we
propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a
Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment
(CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the
language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA
reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English
reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to
non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B
models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior
performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also
exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.

Motivation: Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks focus on factual retrieval, but real business contexts require complex reasoning like causal analysis, forecasting, and strategic recommendations.

Method: Created CORGI benchmark with synthetic enterprise databases and questions across four complexity levels: descriptive, explanatory, predictive, and recommendational queries.

Result: LLM performance drops significantly on high-level questions, with CORGI being 21% more difficult than BIRD benchmark, revealing gaps in real-world business intelligence capabilities.

Conclusion: There's a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and the needs of real-world business intelligence, highlighting the need for improved reasoning in text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: In the business domain, where data-driven decision making is crucial,
text-to-SQL is fundamental for easy natural language access to structured data.
While recent LLMs have achieved strong performance in code generation, existing
text-to-SQL benchmarks remain focused on factual retrieval of past records. We
introduce CORGI, a new benchmark specifically designed for real-world business
contexts. CORGI is composed of synthetic databases inspired by enterprises such
as Doordash, Airbnb, and Lululemon. It provides questions across four
increasingly complex categories of business queries: descriptive, explanatory,
predictive, and recommendational. This challenge calls for causal reasoning,
temporal forecasting, and strategic recommendation, reflecting multi-level and
multi-step agentic intelligence. We find that LLM performance drops on
high-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offer
actionable plans. Based on execution success rate, the CORGI benchmark is about
21\% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark. This highlights the gap between
popular LLMs and the need for real-world business intelligence. We release a
public dataset and evaluation framework, and a website for public submissions.

### [104] [Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07315)
*Ming Zhong,Xiang Zhou,Ting-Yun Chang,Qingze Wang,Nan Xu,Xiance Si,Dan Garrette,Shyam Upadhyay,Jeremiah Liu,Jiawei Han,Benoit Schillings,Jiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriCode introduces a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions and Vibe Checker testbed to evaluate LLMs' code instruction following capabilities, showing that instruction following is crucial for human preference in coding beyond functional correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code evaluation focuses only on functional correctness (pass@k) but overlooks non-functional instructions that users apply during vibe coding, where solutions should feel right, read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct.

Method: Created VeriCode taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions with deterministic verifiers, augmented established evaluation suites to build Vibe Checker testbed, and evaluated 31 leading LLMs on both instruction following and functional correctness.

Result: Even the strongest models struggle with multiple instructions and show functional regression. A composite score of functional correctness and instruction following correlates best with human preference, with instruction following being the primary differentiator in real-world programming tasks.

Conclusion: Instruction following is the missing piece underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding. The work provides a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage
LLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language
interactions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world
human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,
read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code
evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,
overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this
paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece
underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides
functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following
capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30
verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic
verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,
resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following
and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even
the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit
clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional
correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human
preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on
real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe
check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that
better align with user preferences in coding.

### [105] [Artificial Hippocampus Networks for Efficient Long-Context Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07318)
*Yunhao Fang,Weihao Yu,Shu Zhong,Qinghao Ye,Xuehan Xiong,Lai Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a memory framework inspired by cognitive science's Multi-Store Model, combining lossless short-term memory (sliding window KV cache) with compressed long-term memory (Artificial Hippocampus Network) to address the efficiency-fidelity trade-off in long-sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers for long-sequence modeling.

Method: Maintains a sliding window of Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while using a learnable Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) to recurrently compress out-of-window information into fixed-size compact long-term memory. AHNs are instantiated using modern RNN-like architectures like Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet.

Result: AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, AHNs reduce inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

Conclusion: The proposed memory framework effectively balances efficiency and fidelity in long-sequence modeling, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency
of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of
lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the
Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of
artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the
Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module
termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses
out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To
validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like
architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive
experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate
that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and
achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while
substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,
augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%
and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k
sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88. Code is available at:

### [106] [Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06229)
*Josh Hunter,John McDermid,Simon Burton,Poppy Fynes,Mia Dempster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a milestone-based approach for railway automation computer vision systems, using route-specific contextual cues to generate sequential datasets and simplify learning by focusing on critical decision points rather than generalized recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional railway automation datasets lack spatio-temporal context for real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions suffer from realism and applicability issues, creating a need for more practical vision systems.

Method: Uses milestone determination and route-specific contextual cues to generate rich sequential datasets, developing targeted rule-based models that focus on critical decision points along railway routes.

Result: The approach enables generation of realistic sequential datasets aligned with real-world operational logic, simplifying the learning process by eliminating need for generalized recognition of dynamic components.

Conclusion: The milestone-based framework provides a practical method for training vision agents in controlled environments, facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway automation.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

### [107] [CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231)
*Mingzhe Zheng,Dingjie Song,Guanyu Zhou,Jun You,Jiahao Zhan,Xuran Ma,Xinyuan Song,Ser-Nam Lim,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations of LLMs in generating emotionally rich movie scripts and proposes CML-Bench for evaluating script quality across three dimensions, plus CML-Instruction to improve LLM script generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate structurally organized texts but lack the nuanced storytelling and emotional depth required for compelling movie scripts, failing to capture the 'soul' of cinema.

Method: Created CML-Dataset with (summary, content) pairs from quality movie scripts, analyzed narrative structures to identify three assessment dimensions (Dialogue Coherence, Character Consistency, Plot Reasonableness), developed CML-Bench benchmark with quantitative metrics, and introduced CML-Instruction prompting strategy.

Result: CML-Bench effectively distinguishes human-written scripts from LLM-generated ones and identifies LLM weaknesses. CML-Instruction helps LLMs generate higher-quality screenplays that align with human preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed CML-Bench provides an effective evaluation framework for movie script quality, and CML-Instruction successfully guides LLMs to produce more cinematically sound scripts that better match human expectations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UVSD is a spammer detection model that treats user behavior as video frames and applies video classification techniques to identify spammers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by video classification technology, viewing user behavior subspace as frame images and consecutive behaviors as a video sequence to detect spammers.

Method: Proposes UVSD model with three key algorithms: user2piexl for user pixelization (users as pixels, stances as RGB values), behavior2image for transforming behavior subspace into frame images using representation learning and diffusion algorithms, and constructing user behavior videos based on temporal features for video classification.

Result: Experiments on WEIBO and TWITTER datasets show UVSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spammer detection.

Conclusion: The UVSD model effectively applies video classification concepts to spammer detection by treating user behavior sequences as videos, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

*Sagar Lekhak,Emmett J. Ientilucci,Dimah Dera,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification in surface landmine/UXO detection using deep learning, making predictions more reliable under noisy and adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic neural networks for landmine detection are vulnerable to noise and adversarial attacks, leading to missed detections or misclassifications in humanitarian demining operations.

Method: Integrated Monte Carlo Dropout into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO classification, tested on simulated datasets under clean, adversarial, and noisy conditions.

Result: The model successfully flagged unreliable predictions under challenging conditions, demonstrating the value of uncertainty quantification for improving decision-making in demining operations.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification is essential for demining applications, highlighting vulnerabilities of existing neural networks to adversarial threats and emphasizing the need for more robust and reliable models.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

*Anselm W. Stark,Marc Ilic,Ali Mokhtari,Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj,Christoph Graeni,Isaac Shiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: multimodars is an open toolkit for deterministic fusion of intravascular imaging and CCTA data, enabling multi-state coronary analysis with optimized performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack open, flexible toolkits for multi-state coronary analysis that combine intravascular imaging's high resolution with CCTA's 3D context while ensuring deterministic behavior and pipeline integration.

Method: Uses deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centered data model, and an optimized Rust backend for high performance. Accepts CSV/NumPy inputs including AIVUS-CAA formats.

Result: Provides a scalable, reproducible framework for coronary analysis that addresses the limitations of prior fusion methods.

Conclusion: multimodars fills the gap in open toolkits for reliable multi-state coronary modeling by combining complementary imaging modalities with deterministic performance.

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

*Ieva Bagdonaviciute,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models show strong visual perception and reasoning but struggle with physical dynamics understanding, revealing a fragmentation between perceptual and physics reasoning skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark VLMs' ability to understand and predict physical dynamics, as current models show strong visual perception but unclear physics reasoning capabilities.

Method: Benchmarked six frontier VLMs on three physical simulation datasets (CLEVRER, Physion, Physion++) with diagnostic subtests isolating perception from physics reasoning.

Result: Weak correlations found between diagnostic performance and evaluation accuracy - models excelling at perception or physics reasoning don't consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual tasks.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have fragmented perceptual and physics skills that fail to combine into causal understanding, highlighting the need for architectures that better bind perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced self-distillation framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that reduces training complexity while achieving high performance by projecting SNN firing rates onto lightweight ANN branches and using reliable self-generated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SNN training methods based on surrogate gradients and BPTT lag behind ANNs in performance and incur significant computational/memory overheads that grow linearly with temporal dimension, making high-performance SNN training challenging under limited computational resources.

Method: An enhanced self-distillation framework jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation, where SNN firing rates are projected onto lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality self-generated knowledge is used to optimize substructures through ANN pathways. The method decouples teacher signals into reliable/unreliable components to ensure only reliable knowledge guides optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that the method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training.

Conclusion: The proposed enhanced self-distillation framework enables efficient and high-performance SNN training by leveraging reliable self-generated knowledge through lightweight ANN pathways, addressing the computational limitations of conventional SNN training methods.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified AI framework for dermatological diagnostics that combines heterogeneous neural network ensembles with integrated large language models to improve diagnostic reliability and generate clinically meaningful reports with patient education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current dermatological diagnostics including inter-observer variability, access disparities, dataset biases, and fragmented AI approaches that treat NLP as separate from clinical decision-making.

Method: Two synergistic innovations: 1) Heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse CNNs with intrinsic uncertainty mechanism for flagging discordant cases, 2) Direct integration of large language models into diagnostic workflow to transform classifications into clinical assessments and patient education.

Result: Creates a cohesive system that bridges diagnostic reliability and communication barriers, generating structured reports with precise lesion characterization, diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring guidance.

Conclusion: The framework represents significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while supporting continuum of care from detection through patient education, improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient noise in LIGO data hinders gravitational wave detection, and with the O3 run introducing two additional noise classes, new models are needed for effective classification.

Method: Train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset of Gravity Spy data with the two additional classes from LIGO O3a run.

Result: Achieved 92.26% classification efficiency, demonstrating ViT's potential to improve gravitational wave detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer effectively distinguishes transient noise and can improve gravitational wave detection by accurately classifying glitches in LIGO data.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a mask-based goal representation for goal-conditioned RL that enables efficient learning and superior generalization to unseen objects without requiring positional information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal representation methods in GCRL (target state images, 3D coordinates, one-hot vectors) suffer from poor generalization to unseen objects, slow convergence, and dependency on special cameras.

Method: Uses mask-based goal representation that provides object-agnostic visual cues, can be processed for dense rewards without distance calculations, and leverages pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask generation.

Result: Achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on both training and unseen test objects in simulation, successfully performed pick-up tasks without positional information, and demonstrated sim-to-real transfer on physical robots.

Conclusion: Mask-based goal representation is an effective approach for GCRL that enables high performance, generalization to unseen objects, and practical deployment on real robots without positional dependencies.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAN-based super-resolution approach enhances low-resolution Hα solar images from GONG to match high-resolution quality from BBSO/GST, recovering fine details in sunspots, filaments and fibrils.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution solar imaging is needed to capture fine-scale dynamic features, but current full-disk Hα images have limited spatial resolution insufficient for resolving small-scale structures.

Method: Uses Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and relativistic discriminator, trained on carefully aligned GONG-GST image pairs.

Result: Model effectively recovers fine details in sunspot penumbrae and resolves filaments/fibrils, achieving MSE=467.15, RMSE=21.59, CC=0.7794. Performance limited by slight misalignments.

Conclusion: GAN-based super-resolution successfully enhances solar image quality, with future work planned to address misalignment issues and expand dataset for improved reconstruction.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ is a training-free method that reduces relation hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by using multi-perspective questions and interleaved chains of images and text to improve relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relation hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination in LVLMs but have received the least attention, hindering model reliability despite strong overall multimodal performance.

Method: ChainMPQ extracts subject/object keywords to enhance image regions, constructs multi-perspective questions focusing on subject, object, and relation components, and sequentially processes these with accumulated textual/visual memories in an interleaved chain.

Result: Experiments show ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its three core modules.

Conclusion: ChainMPQ provides an effective training-free approach to address the prevalent but understudied problem of relation hallucinations in LVLMs through progressive relational reasoning.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

TL;DR: MobilePicasso enables efficient 4K image editing on mobile devices using a three-stage approach with hallucination-aware loss, latent projection, and adaptive tiling, achieving significant speed improvements and reduced hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image editing face memory and quality challenges on resource-constrained mobile devices, making high-resolution image editing impractical for mobile applications.

Method: Three-stage system: (1) image editing at standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (2) latent projection to avoid pixel space conversion, (3) upscaling with adaptive context-preserving tiling.

Result: Improves image quality by 18-48%, reduces hallucinations by 14-51%, achieves up to 55.8x speed-up with only 9% memory increase, and runs faster on-device than server-based models on A100 GPU.

Conclusion: MobilePicasso successfully enables efficient high-resolution image editing on mobile devices with superior performance, reduced hallucinations, and practical computational requirements.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Implementation of AI-based Gaze Tracking using RGBD images with Transformer feature fusion, achieving competitive results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored combination of RGBD input images and Transformers for gaze tracking, and create a new dataset since existing ones lack depth information or suitable labels for Gaze Angle Estimation.

Method: Uses RGBD images with Transformer architecture for feature fusion, builds on Lian et al.'s GAN-based approach for depth map artifact removal and head pose feature extraction, and creates new dataset for training.

Result: Transformer model achieved 55.3mm mean Euclidean error on ShanghaiTechGaze+ dataset, but removing pre-trained GAN module improved to 30.1mm. Replacing Transformer with MLP further improved to 26.9mm. On ETH-XGaze dataset, Transformer achieved 3.59° mean angular error vs 3.26° without Transformer.

Conclusion: The combination of RGBD and Transformers shows promise for gaze tracking, but simpler architectures like MLP may outperform Transformers for this specific task. The approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

*Tiago de Conto,John Armston,Ralph Dubayah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework fuses GEDI lidar with SAR data to create global, high-resolution maps of forest structural complexity, achieving high accuracy with minimal computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spaceborne lidar from GEDI provides forest structural complexity data but has sparse sampling that limits continuous high-resolution mapping capabilities.

Method: Adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture trained on 130+ million GEDI footprints, fusing GEDI observations with multimodal SAR datasets to produce 25m resolution global maps.

Result: Achieves high performance (global R² = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000 parameters, producing accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty across biomes and time periods.

Conclusion: This scalable framework enables continuous monitoring of global forest dynamics and provides accessible tools for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

*Allen Tu,Kartik Narayan,Joshua Gleason,Jennifer Xu,Matthew Meyn,Tom Goldstein,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFIRA is a lightweight, annotation-free framework for face image recognizability assessment that uses embedding space geometry to measure recognizability via class-center similarity and angular separation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without external labels or backbone-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition in unconstrained environments faces extreme variations in pose, blur, illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to predict recognizability. Existing FIQA methods rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or intensive generative pipelines, making their predictions detached from the encoder's decision geometry.

Method: TransFIRA introduces a geometry-driven framework using class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS) to define recognizability directly in embedding space. It employs a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C datasets, nearly doubles correlation with true recognizability, and demonstrates strong performance on body recognition with robustness under cross-dataset shifts.

Conclusion: TransFIRA establishes a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment that is encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities, significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NYSDOT needs automated support for labor-intensive road condition evaluation during winter weather events to make critical operational decisions.

Method: Convolutional neural networks and random forests trained on ~22,000 hand-labeled camera images classified into six road surface conditions (severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, obstructed) combined with weather data.

Result: The weather-related road surface condition model achieves 81.5% accuracy on completely unseen cameras, with model generalizability prioritized for operational needs.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can effectively support NYSDOT by automatically classifying road conditions, providing valuable assistance for winter weather operational decisions.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal images from low-cost cameras suffer from low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and localized degradations, while available thermal imaging datasets are limited in size and diversity, creating challenges for effective restoration methods.

Method: A patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that trains on small thermal patches to leverage the local nature of distortions, then restores full-resolution images by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing.

Result: Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong performance on both simulated and real thermal data, establishing the method as a unified restoration pipeline.

Conclusion: TDiff represents the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks, effectively addressing the unique challenges of thermal imaging.

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated

Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches in multi-subject identity-preserved generation and provide flexible user guidance options from coarse to precise levels.

Method: Introduces SIGMA-SET27K synthetic dataset with identity, structure, and spatial information for 100k+ subjects across 27k images, and develops a framework supporting various guidance levels (boxes, segmentations, depth) with a single model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image generation quality, and speed through extensive evaluation.

Conclusion: SIGMA-GEN provides an effective unified solution for multi-identity preserving image generation with flexible guidance options and superior performance.

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both
structural and spatial constraints. A key strength of our method is its ability
to support user guidance at various levels of precision -- from coarse 2D or 3D
boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects

TL;DR: SIGRID is a new superpixel-based data structure that encodes color and shape information while reducing input dimensionality, achieving comparable or better segmentation performance than pixel-level representations with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superpixels offer computational benefits but their irregular distribution requires specialized deep learning approaches, undermining their original efficiency motivation.

Method: Developed SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated Grid) using classical shape descriptors to encode superpixel color and shape information, substantially reducing input dimensionality for segmentation tasks.

Result: SIGRIDs matched or surpassed pixel-level representation performance on four benchmark datasets using two convolutional segmentation architectures, while significantly accelerating model training.

Conclusion: SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that compressed superpixel representations can effectively replace full-resolution images in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text2Interact framework generates realistic human-human interactions from text using scalable data synthesis and fine-grained spatiotemporal coordination, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with realistic human-human interaction modeling due to limited two-person training data and coarse text conditioning that collapses rich prompts into single embeddings.

Method: Proposes InterCompose for scalable interaction data synthesis using LLM-generated descriptions and single-person motion priors, and InterActor with word-level conditioning and adaptive interaction loss for fine-grained spatiotemporal coordination.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements in motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including successful performance on out-of-distribution scenarios and positive user study results.

Conclusion: The Text2Interact framework effectively addresses key challenges in text-to-interaction modeling through scalable data synthesis and fine-grained coordination, with plans to release code and models for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

Motivation: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of informative frames from long videos to reduce computational costs while retaining semantic and contextual information.

Method: Proposes KeyScore framework that jointly uses captions and visual context to estimate frame importance through semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact. Also introduces STACFP for generating compact and diverse frame proposals from long videos.

Result: Achieves up to 99% frame reduction compared to full-frame inference and substantially outperforms standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo datasets for retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and caption-grounded video understanding without explicit video summarization.

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogSTOP is a scoring function that efficiently computes temporal property scores from noisy local detectors (YOLO, HuBERT) using Linear Temporal Logic, outperforming large vision/audio models and other baselines in query matching and ranked retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable temporal reasoning over sequences by lifting local detection scores (objects, emotions) to temporal properties for applications like query matching and ranked retrieval.

Method: Proposed LogSTOP scoring function that computes scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic, using potentially noisy local property predictors.

Result: LogSTOP outperforms Large Vision/Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic baselines by at least 16% on query matching, and achieves 19% and 16% increases in mean average precision and recall respectively on ranked retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: LogSTOP provides an effective framework for scoring temporal properties over sequences using local detectors, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods for temporal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TEMDiff is a 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework that addresses the missing-wedge problem in limited-angle electron tomography by learning structural priors from FIB-SEM data through simulation, enabling high-quality reconstruction from narrow tilt ranges without requiring clean TEM ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle electron tomography suffers from severe reconstruction artifacts due to the missing-wedge problem, and existing deep learning approaches require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth that are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy.

Method: Proposes TEMDiff, a 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling learning of realistic structural priors without clean TEM ground truth. The method operates directly on 3D volumes to implicitly enforce consistency across slices.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality on simulated electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage. The trained model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as narrow as 8 degrees with 2-degree increments, without retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TEMDiff provides an effective solution for limited-angle electron tomography that overcomes the need for difficult-to-obtain clean TEM ground truth data, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and high-quality reconstruction even from extremely narrow tilt ranges.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

*Xiangyi Chen,Théophane Vallaeys,Maha Elbayad,John Nguyen,Jakob Verbeek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VUGEN is a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models' pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation without complex bridging mechanisms or reconstruction-oriented autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for equipping VLMs with image generation capabilities often rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations or architectural complexity.

Method: VUGEN transforms the VLM's high-dimensional latent space into a lower-dimensional distribution that preserves visual information, trains the VLM to sample within this reduced latent space, and uses a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to map generated latents back to image space.

Result: VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed VUGEN framework successfully leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation, demonstrating that VAE-free pixel diffusion decoders can outperform complex latent diffusion decoders.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

### [132] [Cluster Paths: Navigating Interpretability in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06541)
*Nicholas M. Kroeger,Vincent Bindschaedler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cluster paths is a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations and represents inputs as sequences of cluster IDs, providing human-readable explanations for neural network decisions while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep neural networks are opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. There is a need for interpretability methods that can explain model decisions.

Method: Cluster activations at selected layers and represent each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. Introduce four metrics: path complexity, weighted-path purity, decision-alignment faithfulness, and path agreement. Extend to concept paths using large language models for minimal path divergences.

Result: In spurious-cue CIFAR-10, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts and collapse when cue is removed. On CelebA hair-color task: 90% faithfulness, 96% agreement under noise without accuracy loss. Scales to ImageNet Vision Transformers. Also serves as effective OOD detector.

Conclusion: Cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise, human-readable explanations that uncover visual concepts like color palettes, textures, and object contexts at multiple network depths.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

### [133] [HSNet: Heterogeneous Subgraph Network for Single Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06564)
*Qiongyang Hu,Wenyang Liu,Wenbin Zou,Yuejiao Su,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSNet is a graph-based image super-resolution method that uses heterogeneous subgraphs and node sampling to achieve high performance with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for image super-resolution suffer from structural inflexibility (CNNs/attention) or high computational complexity (graph-based methods).

Method: Proposes Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet) with three components: Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB) for diverse subgraph generation, Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) for multi-graph feature fusion, and Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) for computational efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HSNet effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods by leveraging graph modeling with computational feasibility through subgraph decomposition and selective feature retention.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

### [134] [Through the Perspective of LiDAR: A Feature-Enriched and Uncertainty-Aware Annotation Pipeline for Terrestrial Point Cloud Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06582)
*Fei Zhang,Rob Chancia,Josie Clapp,Amirhossein Hassanzadeh,Dimah Dera,Richard MacKenzie,Jan van Aardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-automated pipeline for semantic segmentation of TLS point clouds that reduces manual annotation effort through uncertainty-aware ensemble learning, feature enrichment, and targeted annotation, validated on mangrove forests with performance plateauing at ~12 annotated scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is costly and time-consuming, limiting the scalability of semantic segmentation for ecological monitoring applications.

Method: Projects 3D points to 2D spherical grid, enriches with multi-source features, uses ensemble segmentation networks to generate pseudo-labels and uncertainty maps, then back-projects to 3D with visualization tools for reviewer guidance.

Result: Performance saturates after ~12 annotated scans, geometric features contribute most to segmentation, and compact nine-channel feature stacks achieve mIoU of ~0.76. Cross-dataset validation confirms generalization.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable, high-quality TLS segmentation with reduced annotation effort, providing empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance for ecological monitoring applications.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

### [135] [Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584)
*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain adaptation using DANN maintains CT image classification accuracy on new ring artifacts without requiring labeled artifact data, outperforming baseline and augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models degrade when encountering new CT scanner artifacts not present in training. Labeling new artifact distributions is costly, so domain adaptation offers a more accessible alternative.

Method: Simulated ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space on OrganAMNIST dataset. Evaluated domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation approaches.

Result: Baseline models failed on ring artifacts, augmentation provided no improvement. DANN maintained high classification accuracy using only unlabeled artifact data, performing comparably to models trained with labeled artifacts.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation effectively addresses distribution shift in medical imaging without expensive expert labeling, showing promise for clinical deployment where novel artifacts may emerge.

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

*Ziyuan Huang,DanDan Zheng,Cheng Zou,Rui Liu,Xiaolong Wang,Kaixiang Ji,Weilong Chai,Jianxin Sun,Libin Wang,Yongjie Lv,Taozhi Huang,Jiajia Liu,Qingpei Guo,Ming Yang,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MingTok introduces continuous latent space visual tokenizers to unify visual understanding and generation, addressing quantization errors in discrete tokenizers that limit semantic expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers use discrete latent spaces with quantization errors that degrade vision-language understanding capabilities and limit semantic expressiveness.

Method: MingTok uses a three-stage sequential architecture with low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction. Ming-UniVision builds on this to unify vision-language tasks under a single autoregressive prediction paradigm.

Result: The unified continuous visual representation reconciles competing requirements of understanding and generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across both domains.

Conclusion: Continuous domain visual tokenization facilitates unified visual understanding and generation, with released inference code and model weights benefiting the community.

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

*Tianyue Xu,Yanlin Wu,Abhai K. Tripathi,Matthew M. Ippolito,Benjamin D. Haeffele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BeerLaNet, a trainable color normalization model based on physics of imaging process to address color variability in digital pathology images for improved cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color inconsistency in pathology images due to different staining protocols and imaging conditions reduces deep learning model performance when deployed on data from different domains (domain shift). Existing color normalization methods have drawbacks like introducing artifacts or requiring careful template selection.

Method: Trainable color normalization model integrated with backbone networks, derived via algorithmic unrolling of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based on Beer-Lambert law physics. Extracts stain-invariant structural information from pathology images.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art stain normalization methods on publicly available pathology datasets and internal malaria blood smear collection for cross-domain object detection and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed BeerLaNet effectively addresses color variability in digital pathology analysis, improving model robustness across different imaging conditions without the drawbacks of existing normalization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDQM, a new metric for evaluating synthetic dataset quality in object detection tasks without requiring model training convergence, showing strong correlation with mAP scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of evaluating synthetic data quality for object detection tasks, as traditional methods require costly iterative training and existing metrics show weak correlation with model performance.

Method: Proposed Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) that assesses data quality without requiring model training to converge, enabling efficient generation and selection of synthetic datasets.

Result: SDQM demonstrated strong correlation with YOLOv11 mAP scores, outperforming previous metrics which only showed moderate or weak correlations. The metric provides actionable insights for dataset improvement.

Conclusion: SDQM sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained object detection tasks.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnrollINR is a zero-shot self-supervised MRI reconstruction framework that combines physics-guided unrolled iterative architecture with Implicit Neural Representation as regularization, achieving superior performance at high acceleration rates without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scan times are prolonged, limiting clinical application. While deep learning methods show promise, they often require fully sampled data which is difficult to obtain. There's a need for scan-specific reconstruction without external training data.

Method: Proposes UnrollINR framework combining physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture with Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as regularization prior. Uses zero-shot self-supervised learning without external data.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to supervised learning methods, even at high acceleration rate of 10. Validates the superiority of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The combination of deep unrolled structure with INR's implicit representation capability enhances interpretability and reconstruction performance, providing an effective solution for scan-specific MRI reconstruction without external data requirements.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: MuEx is a multilingual talking face synthesis framework that uses phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio and video modalities, achieving lifelike facial animations across multiple languages with effective zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current talking face synthesis models perform well in English but poorly in non-English languages due to English-dominated training datasets and lack of cross-language generalization abilities.

Method: Proposes Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture using phonemes and visemes as basic units, with Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align) for cross-modal synchronization. Also builds Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) with 12 languages and 95.04 hours of videos.

Result: MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses multilingual talking face synthesis challenges by using universal phoneme-viseme intermediaries and achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based trackers struggle with occlusion, similar object interference, and complex backgrounds. Multispectral imagery provides better target discrimination but lacks large-scale datasets.

Method: Created MSITrack dataset with 300 videos across 55 categories, featuring challenging attributes like similar object interference and natural scene complexity. All frames were manually labeled and verified.

Result: Extensive evaluations show multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves tracking performance over RGB-only baselines.

Conclusion: MSITrack bridges the multispectral tracking dataset gap and has potential to drive future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The

TL;DR: StaR-KVQA improves implicit-knowledge visual question answering by supervising structured reasoning traces (dual symbolic relation paths with explanations) to make reasoning transparent and verifiable, achieving significant accuracy gains without external knowledge sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications in IK-KVQA tasks, performing poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Constructs and selects path-grounded reasoning traces to form trace-enriched datasets, then fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with supervision, using only one open-source MLLM without external retrievers or knowledge bases.

Result: Achieves up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over strongest baselines while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: StaR-KVQA effectively improves both accuracy and interpretability in implicit-knowledge visual question answering through structured reasoning supervision.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Result: Validated on three industrial defect datasets and applied within a defect imaging and detection platform. The framework addresses both intraclass differences and interclass similarity while reducing manual network design costs.

Conclusion: AutoNAD effectively addresses key challenges in industrial surface defect detection through automated neural architecture design, combining multiple architecture types and incorporating efficiency considerations for practical deployment.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply foundational language modeling principles to visual signals by creating a principled autoregressive approach for images that doesn't rely on common techniques like CFG and semantic tokenizers.

Method: Uses a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at each timestep (next 2D distribution prediction).

Result: Achieves FID of 2.70 on ImageNet generation benchmark, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive approaches.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates successful application of language modeling principles to visual signals and aims to inspire principled rethinking of autoregressive modeling beyond text.

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

*Bin Xia,Bohao Peng,Yuechen Zhang,Junjia Huang,Jiyang Liu,Jingyao Li,Haoru Tan,Sitong Wu,Chengyao Wang,Yitong Wang,Xinglong Wu,Bei Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamOmni2 addresses limitations in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven generation by introducing multimodal instruction-based editing and generation tasks that support both text/image instructions and handle concrete/abstract concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based editing relies only on language which fails to capture specific details, while subject-driven generation is limited to concrete objects and ignores abstract concepts, making both approaches insufficient for practical user needs.

Method: Proposes a data synthesis pipeline with feature mixing for concept extraction, generates multimodal editing training data, and introduces index encoding with position encoding shift to handle multi-image input and avoid pixel confusion. Uses joint training with VLM and generation/editing models.

Result: DreamOmni2 achieves impressive results on the proposed multimodal instruction-based editing and generation tasks, with comprehensive benchmarks established to drive further development.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by supporting multimodal instructions and handling both concrete and abstract concepts, significantly enhancing practical applications of image editing and generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

*Jie Luo,Yuxuan Jiang,Xin Jin,Mingyu Liu,Yihui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal semantic segmentation method called Mlpfseg that fuses light field and LiDAR point cloud data with feature completion and depth perception modules to improve segmentation performance, especially for occluded objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation faces challenges under complex conditions like occlusion in autonomous driving. Light field and LiDAR provide complementary visual and spatial cues, but their integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and modality discrepancies.

Method: Proposed Mlpfseg network with two key modules: 1) Feature completion module that performs differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps to address density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels, 2) Depth perception module that reinforces attention scores for better occlusion awareness.

Result: Outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 mIoU and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating effectiveness of the multimodal fusion approach.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal fusion method effectively integrates light field and LiDAR data, addressing occlusion challenges and improving semantic segmentation performance for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent dynamic scene modeling faces challenges in capturing accurate deformations while maintaining computational efficiency, as real-world deformations often exhibit hierarchical patterns.

Method: The framework leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting, progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level to fine point-level using cascaded optimization.

Result: SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame, producing comparable results to existing methods with only one-twentieth of the training iterations, and demonstrates effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded optimization approach enables efficient and accurate dynamic scene modeling by exploiting hierarchical deformation patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

Motivation: Digital humanities scholars lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR, as traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation.

Method: Developed an evaluation methodology using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts, introducing novel metrics including Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), with protocols for contamination control and stability testing. Evaluated 12 multimodal LLMs.

Result: Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR but exhibit over-historicization - inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves performance.

Conclusion: The methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization, addressing contamination risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription.

*Zhiliang Zhu,Tao Zeng,Tao Yang,Guoliang Luo,Jiyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeRainMamba is a novel image deraining method that combines frequency-aware state-space modeling with multi-directional convolution to effectively remove rain while preserving image details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based models have limitations in capturing fine-grained details and lack frequency-domain awareness, which restricts their performance in image deraining tasks.

Method: Proposes DeRainMamba with Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) that uses Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from image details, and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) that captures anisotropic gradient features and fuses multiple convolution branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks show DeRainMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM metrics while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement within a state-space framework is effective for single image deraining, achieving superior performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

TL;DR: OBS-Diff is a one-shot pruning framework that compresses large text-to-image diffusion models without training, using adapted Optimal Brain Surgeon with timestep-aware Hessian and group-wise pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have prohibitive computational costs, and existing one-shot pruning methods cannot handle their iterative denoising nature.

Method: Adapts Optimal Brain Surgeon for diffusion models, introduces timestep-aware Hessian with logarithmic weighting for early timesteps, and uses group-wise sequential pruning to reduce calibration cost.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning with inference acceleration and minimal visual quality degradation.

Conclusion: OBS-Diff effectively bridges the gap for pruning diffusion models, enabling efficient compression while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

*Sheng Fu,Junchao Zhang,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A histogram matching approach transforms arbitrary noise towards Gaussian distribution, enabling single Gaussian denoisers to handle various out-of-distribution noises through a mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Gaussian denoisers have limited generalization for out-of-distribution noise due to diverse noise distribution characteristics.

Method: Proposes histogram matching to transform arbitrary noise to target Gaussian distribution, establishes mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising, uses local histogram matching for signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation for channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching with pixel-shuffle down-sampling for spatial correlation.

Result: Single Gaussian denoiser gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises including Poisson, salt-and-pepper, repeating pattern noises, and complex real-world noises.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates superior generalization and effectiveness through extensive experiments, enabling robust denoising performance across diverse noise types.

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

### [153] [A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06769)
*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Deep Multiple Instance Learning method for land-cover classification using high-resolution satellite imagery with weak low-resolution labels, addressing label quality and quantity issues in remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the central problem of insufficient high-quality training labels in land-cover mapping by leveraging abundant but weak low-resolution reference data like MODIS-derived maps.

Method: Uses flexible pooling layers to link pixel-level semantics to patch-level weak labels, reframing MIL in multi-class and multi-label settings with Positive-Unlabeled Learning for cases where multiple land-cover classes can coexist.

Result: Experimental results on IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset demonstrate the framework's effectiveness compared to standard training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed DMIL framework successfully enables training pixel-level classifiers using only weak low-resolution labels, providing a practical solution for land-cover mapping with limited high-quality annotations.

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTRV enhances vision language models through test-time reinforcement learning without labeled data, using frequency-based rewards and entropy control to improve object recognition and VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward signal extraction methods require labeled data and training splits, which differs from how humans learn directly from their environment. The goal is to enable models to adapt at inference time without labeled data.

Method: Enhanced GRPO framework with rewards based on output frequency and multiple inferences per test sample. Added entropy control to reward low entropy in output distribution for diversity management.

Result: Achieved up to 52.4% improvement in object recognition and 29.8% in VQA, with average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpassed GPT-4o by 2.3% on image recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: Test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed proprietary models, and even works in extremely data-constrained scenarios with single unlabeled examples, showing non-trivial improvements up to 5.5%.

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a heatmap-based extreme amodal face detector that uses contextual cues from single images to infer unseen faces outside the field-of-view, outperforming less efficient generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and privacy applications by detecting faces that are not visible in the input image but exist within an expanded field-of-view, focusing on single-image inference rather than image sequences.

Method: A heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector with selective coarse-to-fine decoder that efficiently predicts out-of-frame regions from limited image information using contextual cues.

Result: The method establishes strong results for extreme amodal detection, outperforming less efficient generative approaches on this new task.

Conclusion: The proposed sample-free approach using contextual cues and coarse-to-fine decoding provides an efficient solution for extreme amodal face detection from single images.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

TL;DR: This paper adapts ultrasound foundation models for real-time probe guidance to help junior sonographers acquire high-quality cardiac ultrasound images, using a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter to encode vision-action sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a shortage of skilled cardiac ultrasound operators, making it difficult for patients to receive timely examinations. High-quality images are essential for accurate diagnosis, but obtaining them requires significant expertise.

Method: Proposes a Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) that enables foundation models to encode vision-action sequences, allowing them to learn probe adjustment strategies with minimal parameter fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the VA-Adapter outperforms strong probe guidance models while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The VA-Adapter successfully adapts foundation models for real-time ultrasound probe guidance, providing operational recommendations to improve image acquisition quality with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

TL;DR: EDJE is an efficient vision-language reranker that precomputes and compresses visual tokens offline, enabling high-throughput inference with minimal storage requirements while maintaining strong retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language rerankers are bottlenecked by expensive visual feature extraction, preventing practical deployment at scale. Unlike text retrieval where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision-language rerankers are largely absent.

Method: EDJE precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter. Online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus text, avoiding expensive visual feature extraction.

Result: EDJE processes 50k image-text pairs/second while requiring only 49kB of disk storage per image. It matches prior art performance on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: EDJE enables practical deployment of vision-language rerankers at scale by drastically reducing storage and online compute requirements while preserving strong retrieval performance.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to reduce content leakage in text-to-image generation using visual style prompts, extending classifier-free guidance with swapping self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual prompting methods for text-to-image generation suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements from visual style prompts are transferred along with intended style.

Method: Extends classifier-free guidance with swapping self-attention and introduces negative visual query guidance (NVQG) that uses negative scores by simulating content leakage scenarios through query swapping in self-attention layers.

Result: Significantly reduces content leakage while maintaining style transfer quality, demonstrating superiority over existing approaches across various styles and text prompts.

Conclusion: NVQG provides an effective solution for using real images as visual style prompts without unwanted content transfer, ensuring generated images match text prompts while reflecting reference styles.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code

### [159] [Lattice-allocated Real-time Line Segment Feature Detection and Tracking Using Only an Event-based Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06829)
*Mikihiro Ikura,Arren Glover,Masayoshi Mizuno,Chiara Bartolozzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a high-resolution event-based camera, achieving higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods without needing frame cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras efficiently capture edge information but existing methods either rely on additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates from modern high-resolution sensors.

Method: A lattice-allocated pipeline with: (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection using fitting scores, and (iii) line segment tracking by perturbing endpoints.

Result: Demonstrated real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines on both custom and public datasets.

Conclusion: Enables fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings without requiring additional frame cameras.

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

*Kanglei Zhou,Qingyi Pan,Xingxing Zhang,Hubert P. H. Shum,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Continual AQA (CAQA) to handle evolving quality distributions in action assessment, proposing MAGR++ method that combines full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive manifold-aligned graph regularization to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AQA methods struggle with non-stationary quality distributions in real-world scenarios, limiting generalization. Continual Learning capabilities are needed to handle evolving distributions while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposed MAGR++ method with full-parameter fine-tuning for representation learning, coupled with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: manifold projector to translate historical features and graph regularizer to align distributions.

Result: MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over strongest baselines across four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MAGR++ method effectively addresses the challenges of continual learning in AQA, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness through systematic evaluation protocols and cross-dataset comparisons.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), a real-time version of GEBD that processes streaming videos without future frame access, and proposes the Estimator framework inspired by human event segmentation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GEBD methods require complete video frames for processing, unlike humans who process data online and in real-time. This gap motivates the development of online GEBD that can detect event boundaries immediately in streaming videos.

Method: Proposes the Estimator framework with two components: Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA) that predicts future frames based on prior frames, and Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD) that measures prediction errors and adaptively adjusts thresholds using statistical tests on past errors.

Result: Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD methods on Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed On-GEBD task and Estimator framework successfully bridge the gap between offline processing and human-like real-time event boundary detection, demonstrating competitive performance while operating in streaming video scenarios.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

TL;DR: Study investigates using raw satellite sensor data vs preprocessed L1 imagery for onboard AI object detection, finding raw data models struggle with object boundaries at high confidence levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable direct deployment of AI models on satellites using raw sensor data instead of preprocessed ground-based products, as processing power increases make onboard AI feasible.

Method: Simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, training YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S models on both raw and L1 datasets, comparing performance with detection metrics and explainability tools.

Result: Both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, but the model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high confidence levels.

Conclusion: Adapting AI architectures with improved contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving onboard AI for remote sensing.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

### [163] [HARP-NeXt: High-Speed and Accurate Range-Point Fusion Network for 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06876)
*Samir Abou Haidar,Alexandre Chariot,Mehdi Darouich,Cyril Joly,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARP-NeXt is a high-speed LiDAR semantic segmentation network that achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off through novel pre-processing, efficient feature extraction blocks, and multi-scale fusion, running 24× faster than top methods without TTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between accuracy and speed in LiDAR semantic segmentation, where existing methods are either accurate but slow (point-based/sparse convolution) or fast but lose geometric information (projection-based), with additional issues from test-time augmentation and demanding pre-processing on embedded systems.

Method: Proposes novel pre-processing to reduce computational overhead, Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction blocks for efficient representation capture without deep stacking, and multi-scale range-point fusion backbone to preserve geometric details at multiple abstraction levels.

Result: Achieves superior speed-accuracy trade-off on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, comparable to top-ranked PTv3 without ensemble models or TTA while running 24× faster.

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt provides an effective solution for high-speed, accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

### [165] [Label-frugal satellite image change detection with generative virtual exemplar learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06926)
*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel active learning approach for change detection in remote sensing that generates critical virtual exemplars using an invertible graph convnet to minimize labeling effort while maximizing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods rely heavily on hand-labeled training data, which is costly and subjective. The paper aims to reduce labeling effort through active learning by selecting only the most informative samples for annotation.

Method: Proposes an active learning framework with a novel model that measures sample importance. Uses an invertible graph convnet to generate virtual exemplars optimized through an adversarial loss that considers representativity, diversity, and ambiguity to challenge current change detection criteria.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the positive impact of the label-efficient learning model, showing superior performance compared to other methods while requiring significantly less labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning approach effectively reduces labeling costs in change detection tasks by intelligently selecting and generating the most critical samples for annotation, leading to improved model performance with minimal human labeling effort.

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

### [166] [IAR2: Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Semantic-Detail Associated Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06928)
*Ran Yi,Teng Hu,Zihan Su,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAR2 is an advanced autoregressive framework that improves visual generation through hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis using a dual codebook system and progressive attention-guided conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous autoregressive models that overlook structural properties of visual data and are constrained by rigid pre-trained codebooks and inaccurate hard clustering.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook for decoupling representations, Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction with Local-Context Enhanced Head, and Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG for conditional generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with FID of 1.50 on ImageNet, surpassing previous methods while demonstrating superior computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The structured coarse-to-fine generation strategy effectively enhances autoregressive image generation performance and expressiveness.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-to-3D adversarial generation method called Phy3DAdvGen that creates physically realizable 3D pedestrians invisible to LiDAR detectors, addressing limitations of existing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D adversarial attacks rarely cause complete object disappearance and are difficult to implement physically. There's a need for effective testing methods to expose vulnerabilities in LiDAR-based 3D object detectors used in autonomous driving.

Method: Phy3DAdvGen systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to generate LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. It uses a physically-informed approach with a constrained object pool of 13 real 3D models to ensure physical realizability.

Result: The method successfully generates 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, demonstrating complete object disappearance.

Conclusion: The approach highlights vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications and provides a physically realizable method for testing LiDAR detection systems.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

TL;DR: DirectGaussian is a novel Text-to-3D method that generates 3D object surfaces using surfels with 2D Gaussian splatting, incorporating curvature constraints for geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-3D methods struggle with complex geometric shapes in natural objects, using either 2D diffusion priors or specific 3D representations, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: Uses surfels to represent 3D surfaces, employs conditional text generation models with 2D Gaussian splatting for rendering, and incorporates curvature constraints during optimization for multi-view geometric consistency.

Result: The framework achieves diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: DirectGaussian provides an effective approach for generating complex 3D object surfaces with improved geometric consistency and quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

TL;DR: MapGR introduces global representation learning for HD map construction, using two modules to enhance query distribution with global context and improve instance detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based approaches for HD map construction rely on independent object queries with local perspectives, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps.

Method: Proposes MapGR with two modules: Global Representation Learning (GRL) module for holistic segmentation task to align query distribution with global map, and Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module to provide global-level contextual information to individual queries.

Result: Substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed global representation learning approach effectively enhances HD map construction by incorporating global context into query optimization, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RICE, a novel method that leverages Large Vision-Language Models' inherent ID-Matching capabilities to improve long video captioning by enhancing image information usage and individual description quantity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video captioning faces the ID-Matching problem - accurately recognizing same individuals across different frames, which few prior works address effectively. Existing methods have limited generalization and rely on point-wise matching.

Method: Built on LVLMs, RICE unlocks inherent ID-Matching capabilities through two approaches: 1) enhancing image information usage and 2) increasing individual description information quantity. A new benchmark was created to assess ID-Matching capabilities.

Result: RICE significantly improves ID-Matching performance on GPT-4o: precision increased from 50% to 90% and recall from 15% to 80% compared to baseline. Enables continuous tracking of individuals in long video captions.

Conclusion: The proposed RICE method effectively addresses the ID-Matching problem in long video captioning by leveraging LVLMs' inherent capabilities, achieving substantial improvements in both precision and recall for identity tracking.

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, enabling adaptation to new actions/styles without motion ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for human motion generation require costly retraining with motion capture data to adapt to unseen actions or styles, which is difficult to scale.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning with a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as reward signal, optimizing diffusion policy via Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization without paired motion data.

Result: Consistently improves quality and diversity of generated motions in cross-dataset adaptation and leave-one-out experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, while preserving original distribution performance.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, data-efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation that works with both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Motivation: To improve temporal consistency in yearly land-cover maps for better modeling of land cover evolution and change over years, particularly for capturing intricate temporal correlations and multiyear crop type patterns.

Method: Combines deep learning with Bayesian modeling using HMMs integrated with Transformer Encoder-based DNNs for cascade classification of yearly satellite image time series.

Result: Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset with 47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 data shows enhanced overall performance and F1 scores, demonstrating the importance of temporal consistency modeling.

Conclusion: HMMs effectively enhance classification performance and temporal consistency in land-cover mapping, proving the effectiveness of combining deep learning with Bayesian modeling approaches.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

*Fenghe Tang,Chengqi Dong,Wenxin Ma,Zikang Xu,Heqin Zhu,Zihang Jiang,Rongsheng Wang,Yuhao Wang,Chenxu Wu,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities, addressing gaps in statistical validation and efficiency considerations in medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite U-Net's dominance in medical image segmentation for over a decade, there has been no systematic benchmark to evaluate the performance and utility of thousands of U-shaped variants, particularly lacking statistical rigor and consideration of efficiency and generalization.

Method: U-Bench evaluates models along three dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. It introduces U-Score metric to capture performance-efficiency trade-off and provides a model advisor agent for model selection guidance.

Result: The benchmark systematically analyzes 100 U-Net variants across diverse datasets and imaging modalities, providing comprehensive insights into dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms' impact on performance.

Conclusion: U-Bench establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in U-Net-based segmentation models, exposing gaps in previous evaluations and enabling community extension of the benchmark.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

### [174] [Concept Retrieval -- What and How?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07058)
*Ori nizan,Oren Shrout,Ayellet Tal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for retrieving images that share central concepts with a query image, going beyond visual similarity to capture underlying narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To retrieve images that share the same central concepts as a query image, capturing the underlying narrative rather than just visual or semantic similarity.

Method: Proposes a novel approach based on two key observations: (1) neighbors in embedding space share at least one concept with query but not necessarily with each other; (2) modeling neighborhood with bimodal Gaussian distribution reveals meaningful structure for concept identification.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The method successfully identifies and retrieves images sharing central concepts through bimodal Gaussian modeling of embedding neighborhoods.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

*Federico Gonzalez,Estefania Talavera,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DADO is a novel self-supervised model that combines attention mechanisms and depth models for unsupervised object discovery, using dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize features based on image characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised object discovery remains a significant challenge in computer vision, as it requires identifying and localizing objects in images without human-annotated labels.

Method: DADO combines attention mechanisms with depth models and employs dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on global image characteristics, addressing challenges like noisy attention maps and complex scenes with varying depth planes.

Result: DADO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks in object discovery accuracy and robustness without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed DADO model effectively addresses unsupervised object discovery challenges by integrating attention and depth models with adaptive feature weighting, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

*Rémi Kazmierczak,Steve Azzolin,Eloïse Berthier,Goran Frehse,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies concept hallucination in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models and proposes CHILI to mitigate this issue by localizing concept pixels for more faithful explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of concept hallucination in CLIP-based explainable AI systems, where CLIP incorrectly predicts concept presence/absence, undermining the faithfulness of explanations in Concept Bottleneck Models.

Method: Introduces CHILI (Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability), which disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts to generate more interpretable saliency-based explanations.

Result: The approach successfully mitigates concept hallucination issues in CLIP-based CBMs and enables generation of more faithful and interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: CHILI provides an effective solution to concept hallucination in CLIP-based explainable AI systems, improving the reliability and interpretability of concept-based explanations.

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

### [177] [MoRe: Monocular Geometry Refinement via Graph Optimization for Cross-View Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07119)
*Dongki Jung,Jaehoon Choi,Yonghan Lee,Sungmin Eum,Heesung Kwon,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRe is a training-free monocular geometry refinement method that improves cross-view consistency and scale alignment through graph-based optimization using feature matching and local planar approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D foundation models have scale ambiguity and cross-view inconsistency issues that limit their broader application in 3D vision tasks.

Method: Uses feature matching between frames to establish correspondences, then applies graph-based optimization with local planar approximation using estimated 3D points and surface normals from monocular foundation models.

Result: Improves cross-view consistency, achieves scale alignment, enhances 3D reconstruction quality, and improves novel view synthesis especially in sparse view scenarios.

Conclusion: MoRe effectively addresses scale ambiguity in monocular geometric priors while preserving 3D structure, making monocular foundation models more practical for broader 3D vision applications.

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

### [178] [Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07126)
*Jan Fiszer,Dominika Ciupek,Maciej Malawski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning maintains brain tumor segmentation performance (92% Dice score) comparable to centralized models despite non-IID data caused by different MRI intensity normalization methods, offering privacy-preserving medical imaging solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical DL including data privacy, storage, and transfer issues while handling non-IID data distributions that commonly occur in federated learning settings.

Method: Simulated non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data subsets, then trained and tested brain tumor segmentation models using federated learning approaches.

Result: FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data, achieving 92% 3D Dice score comparable to centralized models trained with all data.

Conclusion: Federated learning is an effective solution for training high-performing medical imaging models without violating data privacy, showing robustness to data heterogeneity from different normalization techniques.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

### [179] [Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07129)
*Sarah Cechnicka,Matthew Baugh,Weitong Zhang,Mischa Dombrowski,Zhe Li,Johannes C. Paetzold,Candice Roufosse,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion uses graph-based object-level representations to enable fine-grained control in medical image generation, addressing challenges in controlled generation for sensitive domains like medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Diffusion Probabilistic Models operate in noisy latent spaces lacking semantic structure, making controlled generation challenging in medical imaging where structural consistency is critical for diagnosis.

Method: Proposes graph-based object-level representations where graph nodes correspond to major structures in images, processed by transformer modules and integrated into diffusion models via text-conditioning mechanisms.

Result: The approach successfully generates medical images that can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks, as demonstrated in a histopathology use case.

Conclusion: Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion provides effective fine-grained control over medical image generation, enabling reliable synthetic data generation for medical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

### [180] [Few-Shot Adaptation Benchmark for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07135)
*Karim El Khoury,Maxime Zanella,Christophe De Vleeschouwer,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs), revealing that models with similar zero-shot performance can behave very differently in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RSVLMs show strong zero-shot performance, their ability to generalize in low-data regimes like few-shot learning remains insufficiently explored, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets using five few-shot adaptation strategies applied to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones.

Result: Models with similar zero-shot performance exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. No clear winner among existing methods was found.

Conclusion: There is a need for developing more robust few-shot adaptation methods specifically tailored to remote sensing, and the authors provide a reproducible benchmarking framework to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating visual token compression in MLLMs. Simple image downsampling outperforms advanced methods, revealing benchmark noise. The paper introduces VTC-Bench with data filtering for fairer evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks designed for MLLM perception/reasoning create task mismatch when evaluating visual token compression methods, leading to unfair comparisons.

Method: Extensive experiments showing downsampling outperforms advanced compression methods, using this insight to develop VTC-Bench with data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks.

Result: Found that current benchmarks are noisy for compression evaluation, and downsampling serves as effective data filter to assess sample difficulty. VTC-Bench enables fairer assessment.

Conclusion: Proposed VTC-Bench framework addresses benchmark limitations for visual token compression evaluation, providing more accurate assessment through data filtering.

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-Performer is a framework for generating synchronized 360-degree novel view videos from monocular human captures using camera-dependent normal maps and multi-view diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with 360-degree viewpoint changes and primarily focus on front-view camera trajectories, limiting their application in human-centric scenarios.

Method: Uses MVHumanNet dataset with camera-dependent normal maps from oriented partial point clouds, and a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: MV-Performer sets a strong benchmark for synchronized 360-degree novel view video generation from monocular human captures.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

### [183] [Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07191)
*Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh,Mina Shaigan,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 SSL model outperforms DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization in chest radiography at 512x512 resolution, with ConvNeXt-B backbone showing best performance. Higher resolution (512x512) is critical for detecting subtle abnormalities, while scaling to 1024x1024 offers minimal gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether DINOv3's SSL improvements translate to better performance in chest radiography, a high-volume modality with fine-grained findings, compared to DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization.

Method: Benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet across 7 datasets (n>814,000) using ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B backbones at multiple resolutions (224x224, 512x512, 1024x1024). Also assessed frozen features from 7B model. Primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels.

Result: At 512x512 resolution, DINOv3 consistently outperformed both DINOv2 and ImageNet. ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16 across all settings. Frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed finetuned models. Resolution gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities.

Conclusion: 512x512 resolution is optimal for chest radiography with DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B providing strongest performance. Higher resolution is critical for SSL benefits, with greatest gains for subtle lesions in emergency/critical care settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

### [184] [EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07206)
*Shirin Shoushtari,Yi Wang,Xiao Shi,M. Salman Asif,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EigenScore is a new OOD detection method that uses the eigenvalue spectrum of posterior covariance from diffusion models to detect distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness in near-OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is critical for safe deployment of ML systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have shown promise for OOD detection, but existing methods often fail in near-OOD scenarios.

Method: Leverages eigenvalue spectrum of posterior covariance induced by diffusion models, using Jacobian-free subspace iteration to estimate leading eigenvalues with only forward evaluations of the denoiser.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 5% AUROC improvement over best baselines, and remains robust in near-OOD settings like CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100 where other diffusion-based methods fail.

Conclusion: Posterior covariance provides a consistent signal for distribution shift, and EigenScore effectively leverages this spectral signature for reliable OOD detection with improved robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPilot is a plug-and-play multi-agent system for test-time prompt optimization in text-to-image synthesis, addressing semantic inconsistencies in complex prompts through error analysis, adaptive exploration, and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex and lengthy prompts, leading to semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Current solutions like fine-tuning are model-specific and require training, while automatic prompt optimization approaches lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies.

Method: Proposes GenPilot - a multi-agent system with error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and memory module for iterative optimization. It operates directly on input text and is model-agnostic.

Result: Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval show improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% respectively, demonstrating enhanced text-image consistency and structural coherence in generated images.

Conclusion: GenPilot provides an effective test-time prompt optimization strategy that is flexible, efficient, and interpretable, suitable for handling long and complex prompts while offering insights into common error patterns and refinement strategies.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

Motivation: Existing datasets focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, lacking diversity in camera shots and comprehensive annotations needed for multi-modal learning in speech video generation.

Method: Created TalkCuts dataset with 164k clips and detailed annotations. Developed Orator framework using LLM as director to orchestrate camera transitions, gestures, and vocal modulation through integrated multi-modal video generation.

Result: Training on TalkCuts significantly improves cinematographic coherence and visual appeal in both pose-guided and audio-driven multi-shot speech video generation settings.

Conclusion: TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning, enabling more realistic and diverse video synthesis.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

### [187] [Evaluating Fundus-Specific Foundation Models for Diabetic Macular Edema Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07277)
*Franco Javier Arellano,José Ignacio Orlando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (RETFound and FLAIR) don't consistently outperform fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 for Diabetic Macular Edema detection, with lightweight CNNs remaining strong baselines in data-scarce environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) detection faces limited annotated data challenges, and while Foundation Models have emerged as alternatives, their effectiveness for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks like DME detection remains unclear.

Method: Systematically compared RETFound and FLAIR Foundation Models against EfficientNet-B0 across different training regimes and evaluation settings using IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2, and OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images datasets.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in most evaluation settings for ROC and precision/recall curves. RETFound showed promise only in OEFI dataset, while FLAIR demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance with appropriate prompting.

Conclusion: Foundation Models might not be suitable for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks like DME detection even after fine-tuning, suggesting lightweight CNNs remain effective baselines in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

*Inzamamul Alam,Md Tanvir Islam,Khan Muhammad,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecGuard is a robust invisible image watermarking method that embeds messages in hidden convolution layers using frequency domain transformation via spectral projection and wavelet decomposition, with enhanced resilience against various attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods lack robustness against transformations like distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbations, creating real-world challenges for authenticity verification.

Method: Embeds messages in hidden convolution layers by converting from spatial to frequency domain using spectral projection of higher frequency bands decomposed by wavelet projection. Uses Fast Fourier Transform for efficient transformation and includes a strength factor for enhanced resilience against attacks.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SpecGuard outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of watermark invisibility, capacity, and robustness against diverse attacks including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions.

Conclusion: SpecGuard provides an effective solution for robust and invisible image watermarking that preserves copyrighted information under challenging transformations, with code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how video diffusion transformers (DiTs) represent interactions, introduces MATRIX-11K dataset with interaction-aware annotations, proposes MATRIX regularization to improve interaction modeling, and develops InterGenEval for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video DiTs struggle with modeling multi-instance and subject-object interactions, raising questions about how these models internally represent interactions.

Method: Curated MATRIX-11K dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks; analyzed semantic grounding (video-to-text attention) and semantic propagation (video-to-video attention); introduced MATRIX regularization to align attention with mask tracks.

Result: Found interaction effects concentrate in specific layers; MATRIX improves interaction fidelity, semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination.

Conclusion: MATRIX regularization effectively enhances video DiTs' ability to model interactions through targeted attention alignment in interaction-dominant layers.

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WristWorld is a 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos from anchor views using geometric reconstruction and video generation, improving VLA performance and bridging the anchor-wrist view gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models to capture fine-grained hand-object interactions, but large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, creating a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Reconstruction extends VGGT with Spatial Projection Consistency Loss to estimate wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (2) Generation uses a video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda datasets. Improves VLA performance by raising average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

Conclusion: WristWorld successfully bridges the anchor-wrist view gap by generating wrist-view videos solely from anchor views, demonstrating improved manipulation performance and spatial consistency in video generation.

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

TL;DR: Pixel-Perfect Depth is a monocular depth estimation model using pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality, artifact-free depth maps without VAE compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address flying pixel artifacts introduced by VAE compression in current generative depth estimation models that fine-tune Stable Diffusion.

Method: Uses pixel-space diffusion generation with two key designs: Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT) that incorporate semantic representations, and Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases tokens for efficiency.

Result: Achieves best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks and significantly outperforms others in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Conclusion: Pixel-space diffusion generation with semantic prompting and cascade design effectively eliminates VAE-induced artifacts while maintaining high accuracy in depth estimation.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for specialized quantum algorithms in computer vision that can leverage quantum computing advantages, and to serve as a reference for the computer vision community to familiarize themselves with QeCV.

Method: Holistic review approach covering quantum computational paradigms (gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing), operational principles of quantum computers, available tools for programming and simulation, and analysis of QeCV methodologies.

Result: A comprehensive introduction to QeCV that bridges computer vision and quantum computing, providing insights into quantum hardware compatibility and potential advantages over classical methods in terms of time scalability and solution quality.

Conclusion: QeCV represents a promising research direction with potential to transform visual signal processing, but requires development of fundamentally new algorithms and faces open challenges in implementation and social implications that need further exploration.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

TL;DR: The Tenet framework decomposes RVOS into referring, video, and segmentation factors, using temporal prompts from object detectors/trackers and prompt preference learning to adapt image-based foundation models for efficient video object segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RVOS methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which is computation-consuming and less scalable. The authors aim to investigate the key to this task and leverage foundation models more efficiently.

Method: Decompose RVOS into three factors: referring, video, and segmentation. Use object detectors and trackers to produce temporal prompts, then apply Prompt Preference Learning to evaluate prompt quality. Use these prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models.

Result: Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet framework in producing high-quality masks for referred objects.

Conclusion: The Tenet framework enables efficient adaptation of image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object segmentation without requiring dense end-to-end training.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

TL;DR: A unified framework for safe navigation that combines risk-averse path refinement using tail-sensitive risk maps from Gaussian-splat Radiance Fields with Next-Best-View planning via Riemannian optimization on SE(3) pose manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires integrating risk aversion with active perception to handle uncertainty while maintaining safety.

Method: Refines coarse reference paths using tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Fields, and formulates NBV selection as Riemannian gradient descent optimization on SE(3) pose manifold to maximize expected information gain.

Result: The approach generates locally safe and feasible trajectories while reducing uncertainty critical for imminent motion through efficient online updates in complex environments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively couples risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning, advancing state-of-the-art with scalable gradient decompositions for complex environments.

Abstract: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational

TL;DR: A real-time transparent obstacle mapping system for lightweight quadrotors using fused ToF camera and ultrasonic sensor data with a lightweight 2D convolution model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent obstacles pose significant challenges for autonomous aerial robots as they lack discernible features and cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and potential collisions. Existing methods are unsuitable for low SWaP robots due to large sensors or high computational requirements.

Method: Fuses data from Time-of-Flight camera and ultrasonic sensor with a custom lightweight 2D convolution model that detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into empty regions of the depth map.

Result: The system accurately detects and maps transparent obstacles in real-time using only a small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor, validated in both controlled and real-world environments with glass obstacles.

Conclusion: This work presents the first real-time, onboard transparent obstacle mapping system for low-SWaP quadrotors using only CPU processing, enabling safe navigation in environments with transparent materials.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world
scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to
reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for
traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can
cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and
potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to
accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often
rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational
burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots.
In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for
detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our
method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor
with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach
accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into
corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent
obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a
small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system
through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments,
demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot
maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the
first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle
mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need comprehensive 3D scene understanding and reliability assessment of perceived information for successful task execution in complex environments. Existing 3D neural feature field methods are scene-specific and lack uncertainty modeling capabilities.

Method: Proposes UniFField - a voxel-based feature representation that incrementally integrates RGB-D images as the robot explores scenes, simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation for visual, semantic, and geometric modalities. The approach is generalizable and can be applied zero-shot to new environments.

Result: The uncertainty estimations accurately describe model prediction errors in scene reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Successfully demonstrated for active object search tasks using a mobile manipulator robot, showing robust decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: UniFField provides a unified uncertainty-aware representation that enables reliable scene understanding and robust decision-making for robotic applications in unstructured environments, addressing key limitations of existing scene-specific methods without uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

Result: A comprehensive full-stack review integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems, providing practical guidance for real-world robotic applications.

Conclusion: This survey offers robotics researchers and practitioners a systematic framework for understanding and applying VLA models, with categorized references available online for easy access.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and
action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA
models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects,
embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to
enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional
task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world
deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action
representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a
comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware
components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic
review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition,
architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and
learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in
real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms,
data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation
methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this
paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying
VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training

TL;DR: TrackVLA++ is a Vision-Language-Action model that enhances embodied visual tracking with spatial reasoning and target memory modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied visual tracking approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or with similar-looking distractors.

Method: Proposes two key modules: 1) Spatial reasoning using Polar-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) to infer target's relative position as polar-coordinate tokens, 2) Target Identification Memory (TIM) with gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, surpassing previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12 on EVT-Bench DT split. Shows strong zero-shot generalization in dynamic and occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: TrackVLA++ effectively addresses limitations in embodied visual tracking through spatial reasoning and temporal memory, enabling robust tracking in challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins
practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service
assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent
advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured
scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and
effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the
presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we
present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances
embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism
and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a
Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative
position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action
prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update
strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal
consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive
experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the
challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading
approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong
zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and
occluded scenarios.

Motivation: Current VLMs lack computational precision for real-world robotics, reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition without leveraging metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration.

Method: TIGeR framework enables VLMs to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize computational code, and invoke specialized libraries. Uses two-stage training (SFT + RFT) with hierarchical reward design on TIGeR-300K dataset.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks and demonstrates centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: TIGeR successfully transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by integrating external computational tools, enabling precise robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial
reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and
lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current
approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera
calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks
that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic
manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel
framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric
computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric
computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize
complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to
recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate
computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To
support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive
tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose
estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,
complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design,
TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while
demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation
tasks.

*Phuong Tuan Dat,Tran Huy Dat*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Replacing MLP with KAN in XLSR-Conformer improves synthetic speech detection by 60.55% in EER on ASVspoof2021 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech synthesis technologies enable sophisticated spoofing attacks that challenge automatic speaker verification systems, and while SSL models like XLSR-Conformer perform well, there's room for architectural improvements.

Method: Replace traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in XLSR-Conformer with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a universal approximator based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem.

Result: 60.55% relative improvement in Equal Error Rate (EER) on LA and DF sets, achieving 0.70% EER on 21LA set. The approach is also robust across various SSL architectures.

Conclusion: Incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for advancing synthetic speech detection capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly
sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic
speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning
(SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated
remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for
architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer
model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator
based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results
on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model
can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA
and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed
replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest
that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for
advances in synthetic speech detection.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AudioMarathon is a benchmark for evaluating Large Audio Language Models on long-form audio, featuring tasks with 90-300 second inputs across speech, sound, and music domains that require complex multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio benchmarks use short clips and don't evaluate models in realistic long context settings, while current LALMs struggle with quadratic attention costs and long-range temporal dependencies.

Method: Created AudioMarathon benchmark with three pillars: long-context audio inputs (90-300 seconds), full domain coverage (speech, sound, music), and complex reasoning requiring multi-hop inference. Evaluated state-of-the-art LALMs and studied acceleration techniques like token pruning and KV cache eviction.

Result: Clear performance drops observed as audio length grows. Large gaps found across current LALMs, highlighting deficiencies in temporal reasoning and memory efficiency. Acceleration techniques showed trade-offs between performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AudioMarathon will drive development of more advanced audio understanding models with better temporal reasoning and memory-efficient architectures for complex audio tasks.

Abstract: Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language
models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention
($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio
benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in
realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce
AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and
inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set
of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations
ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of
2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,
sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We
evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio
length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs
of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across
current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and
memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio
and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding
models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A new LLM-based approach for Automatic Term Extraction that outperforms existing methods across multiple domains by using pseudo-label generation and fine-tuning, achieving 10% average improvement on 5/7 domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ATE methods require expensive human annotation and struggle with domain transfer, limiting practical deployment. There's a need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic evaluation settings.

Method: Generate pseudo-labels with black-box LLM on general and scientific domains, then fine-tune LLMs for ATE. Apply lightweight post-hoc heuristics for document-level consistency.

Result: Outperforms supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot learning baselines. Competes with GPT-4o teacher. Exceeds previous approaches on 5/7 domains with 10 percentage point average improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based approach provides a robust solution for ATE across diverse domains, with released dataset and models to support future research.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is a critical component in downstream NLP
tasks such as document tagging, ontology construction and patent analysis.
Current state-of-the-art methods require expensive human annotation and
struggle with domain transfer, limiting their practical deployment. This
highlights the need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic
evaluation settings. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark
spanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the
document- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model
that outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot
learning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this
benchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this
black-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability.
Building on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE. To further enhance
document-level consistency, oftentimes needed for downstream tasks, we
introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics. Our approach exceeds previous
approaches on 5/7 domains with an average improvement of 10 percentage points.
We release our dataset and fine-tuned models to support future research in this
area.

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical

information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for

TL;DR: Proposes a Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework for automated scientific research with leader loop for plan evolution and follower loop for plan execution, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating end-to-end scientific research requires both novel high-level planning and correct execution under dynamic conditions, presenting a bilevel challenge.

Method: DLMA framework with two loops: leader loop (professor agents) evolves research plans using evolutionary algorithm with meetings; follower loop (doctoral student agents) executes plans with dynamic adjustments via meetings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art scores on ACLAward and Laboratory benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines. Ablation studies confirm both loops are critical.

Conclusion: DLMA successfully addresses the bilevel challenge of automated scientific research through its double-loop architecture combining evolution for novelty and execution for soundness.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

### [206] [Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06953)
*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that uniform information density at the step-level in LLM reasoning traces correlates with reasoning quality, with correct traces avoiding information spikes while incorrect ones show irregular bursts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis applies to LLM reasoning traces and whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality.

Method: Proposed an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduced two complementary measures of uniformity: local and global uniformity scores.

Result: Step-level uniformity improves accuracy by 10-32% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Correct reasoning traces avoid sharp information density spikes, while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts.

Conclusion: UID-inspired information density measures outperform alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality, highlighting uniformity as a robust diagnostic and selection criterion for building more reliable reasoning systems.

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

### [207] [The Cognitive Bandwidth Bottleneck: Shifting Long-Horizon Agent from Planning with Actions to Planning with Schemas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07091)
*Baixuan Xu,Tianshi Zheng,Zhaowei Wang,Hong Ting Tsang,Weiqi Wang,Tianqing Fang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies optimal action representations for long-horizon agents in combinatorial action spaces, comparing Planning with Actions (PwA) vs Planning with Schemas (PwS), identifying an inflection point between different environment scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impracticality of conventional action-based planning in combinatorial action spaces (like open-ended real world), and determine optimal action representations for scalable long-horizon autonomy.

Method: Systematic comparison of two action representations: PwA (conventional action lists) and PwS (schema-based instantiation). Proposed cognitive bandwidth framework and conducted controlled experiments across ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions) environments.

Result: Found a representation-choice inflection point between ALFWorld and SciWorld, showing PwS becomes preferable as action space scales. Model capacity affects inflection point location: stronger planning shifts it rightward, better schema instantiation shifts it leftward.

Conclusion: PwS offers better scalability for combinatorial action spaces, but current implementations are suboptimal. Provided actionable guidance for building more capable PwS agents for scalable autonomy.

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A new framework for segmenting Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) in 3D brain MRI using transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture with novel anisotropic Total Variation loss for improved accuracy and reduced false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCD is difficult to detect in MRI due to subtle lesions, limited annotated datasets, small lesion size, weak contrast, and need for anatomical consistency not addressed by standard loss functions.

Method: Transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture with novel loss combining Dice loss and anisotropic Total Variation term to encourage spatial smoothness and reduce false positives without post-processing.

Result: 11.9% improvement in Dice coefficient, 13.3% higher precision over baseline, and 61.6% reduction in false positive clusters on public FCD dataset with 85 patients.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with anisotropic TV loss significantly improves FCD segmentation accuracy and consistency while reducing false positives, demonstrating superior performance over standard approaches.

Abstract: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a primary cause of drug-resistant epilepsy
and is difficult to detect in brain {magnetic resonance imaging} (MRI) due to
the subtle and small-scale nature of its lesions. Accurate segmentation of FCD
regions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical
planning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to
the limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size
and weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal
inputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is
often not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents
a new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt
state-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and
introduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total
Variation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and
reduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing. The
framework is evaluated on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients and
demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency compared to
standard loss formulations. The model with the proposed TV loss shows an 11.9\%
improvement on the Dice coefficient and 13.3\% higher precision over the
baseline model. Moreover, the number of false positive clusters is reduced by
61.6%

*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SER-Diff is a novel incremental learning framework that combines diffusion models with synthetic error replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in brain tumor segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple BraTS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in incremental brain tumor segmentation without relying on generative replay or auxiliary storage, while leveraging diffusion models' refinement capabilities in an incremental learning context.

Method: Uses a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate synthetic error maps from past tasks, replaying them during new task training with a dual-loss formulation (Dice loss for new data + knowledge distillation loss for replayed errors).

Result: Achieved highest Dice scores of 95.8%, 94.9%, and 94.6% and lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.9 mm on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 respectively, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: SER-Diff effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while delivering more accurate and anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets, demonstrating the successful unification of diffusion-based refinement with incremental learning.

Abstract: Incremental brain tumor segmentation is critical for models that must adapt
to evolving clinical datasets without retraining on all prior data. However,
catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge,
remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge
distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative
replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective
for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental
learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the
first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental
learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate
synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new
tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge
distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention.
Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff
consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of
95.8\%, 94.9\%, and 94.6\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7
mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only
mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and
anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A conditional denoising diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction for accelerated MRI reconstruction that embeds measurement models directly into every reverse diffusion step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisition time is a critical limitation in clinical settings, and existing undersampling strategies cause artifacts. Current diffusion models either use unsupervised approaches or apply data consistency as post-processing, lacking integrated physics enforcement.

Method: Hybrid conditional denoising diffusion framework trained on paired undersampled-ground truth data, with measurement model embedded directly into every reverse diffusion step for iterative data-consistency correction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion-based methods on fastMRI dataset in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics, with LPIPS capturing perceptual improvements more faithfully.

Conclusion: Integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism, establishing a principled advance toward robust, accelerated MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in modern medical
diagnostics, yet its prolonged acquisition time remains a critical limitation,
especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. While undersampling strategies
can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and
degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing
high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors;
however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score
functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a
post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising
diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs
from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every
reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground
truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit
enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that
our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning
and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing
perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that
integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields
substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism,
establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: Development of an end-to-end deep neural network to automatically generate patient-specific finite element meshes from 3D CT images for thoracic aortic aneurysm rupture risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current patient-specific anatomical modeling for TAA rupture risk assessment relies on manual segmentation, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale for large patient populations, limiting clinical adoption.

Method: Created an end-to-end deep neural network that directly generates patient-specific finite element meshes from 3D CT images, building on previous work that reduced FEA computation time through PyTorch FEA library and DNN integration.

Result: The approach successfully overcomes the labor-intensive manual segmentation barrier, enabling automated mesh generation for TAA rupture risk assessment.

Conclusion: This work addresses a major clinical adoption barrier by automating the 3D reconstruction process, making patient-specific TAA rupture risk assessment more scalable and clinically feasible.

Abstract: Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in
the U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal
bulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults.
From the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on
the aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be
obtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite
Element Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be
calculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure
model. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture
risk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited
due to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient
specific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it
time consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and
computational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and
incompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was
successfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA
library and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA
functionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static
determinacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately
three minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the
PyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to
only a few seconds per case. This work focuses on overcoming the first barrier
through the development of an end to end deep neural network capable of
generating patient specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D
CT images.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and
reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic
attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for
healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their
operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians
and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse,
pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe
model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face
corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple
roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias
identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and
workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance,

*Mattia Samory,Diana Pamfile,Andrew To,Shruti Phadke*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: ModQ is a novel question-answering framework for rule-sensitive content moderation that identifies which community rule best applies to a given comment, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches while being lightweight and interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online communities face challenges with varying, evolving rules that are enforced inconsistently, creating issues for transparency, governance, and automation in content moderation.

Method: Two model variants (extractive and multiple-choice QA) are trained on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, conditioning on the full set of community rules at inference time to identify applicable rule violations.

Result: Both ModQ models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant rule violations and generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules.

Conclusion: ModQ supports low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments through its lightweight, interpretable approach to rule-sensitive content moderation.

Abstract: Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored
rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules
vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced
inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation.
In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at
scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for
rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or
generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules
at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We
implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train
them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we
construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both
models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant
rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ
models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting
low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effects of zero-shot LLMs and prompting strategies on chart reading tasks, particularly comparing different model architectures.

Method: Evaluated 107 visualization questions using GPT-5 and GPT-4V, focusing on difficult instances where GPT-4V failed, with various prompt variants.

Result: GPT-5 substantially improved inference accuracy compared to GPT-4V, while prompt variations had only minor effects on performance.

*Lucio La Cava,Luca Maria Aiello,Andrea Tagarelli*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: First large-scale study of machine-generated text (MGT) on Reddit shows it's marginally present overall but can reach 9% in some communities, with distinct social signals and comparable engagement to human content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how machine-generated text integrates into social media environments, particularly Reddit, given the rapid growth of generative AI in online communication.

Method: Analyzed over two years of Reddit activity (2022-2024) across 51 representative subreddits using state-of-the-art statistical detection for MGT, studying concentration across communities, social signals, and engagement levels.

Result: MGT is unevenly distributed, more prevalent in technical knowledge and social support communities, often concentrated in few users' activity. MGT conveys distinct warmth and status signals typical of AI assistants but achieves comparable or higher engagement than human content.

Conclusion: AI-generated text is becoming an organic component of online social discourse, requiring new investigations into platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping online communication by
enabling large-scale production of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) at low cost.
While its presence is rapidly growing across the Web, little is known about how
MGT integrates into social media environments. In this paper, we present the
first large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-art
statistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity
(2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main community
types such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study the
concentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT to
human-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement it
receives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates that
synthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to
9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed across
communities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge and
social support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction of
users. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status giving
typical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGT
achieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a few
cases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organic
component of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective on
the MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involving
platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.

*Jiachen Li,Bang Wu,Xiaoyu Xia,Xiaoning Liu,Xun Yi,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes TMPBD, an unsupervised backdoor detection method for SNNs using temporal membrane potential statistics, and NDSBM, a mitigation technique that suppresses malicious neurons while preserving clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs have superior energy efficiency but their security aspects, especially against backdoor attacks, are under-explored. Traditional ANN defenses perform poorly in SNNs due to event-driven and temporal dependencies.

Method: TMPBD uses maximum margin statistics of temporal membrane potential in the final spiking layer for detection. NDSBM clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to suppress malicious neurons, guided by TMP from clean unlabeled data.

Result: TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy. NDSBM reduces attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy on multiple neuromorphic benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses backdoor attacks in SNNs through temporal membrane potential analysis and neural dendrites suppression, providing robust security without compromising performance.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their
superior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
However, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have
received limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform
poorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal
dependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional
backdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection
framework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome
these challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal
membrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels
without any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust
mitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM),
which clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to
suppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP
extracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on
multiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic
trigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while
NDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when
combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.

TL;DR: Bionetta framework outperforms similar tools like EZKL, Lagrange's deep-prove, and zkml with significantly faster proving times, enabling client-side proving on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a zero-knowledge machine learning framework that can run efficiently on mobile devices and be deployable on native EVM smart contracts without excessive proof size and verification overheads.

Method: Uses UltraGroth-based approach with custom-crafted neural networks, accepting increased one-time preprocessing costs (circuit compilation and trusted setup) for better runtime performance.

Result: Significant boost in proving time compared to similar tools, enabling neural network proofs even on mobile devices while maintaining compatibility with native EVM smart contracts.

Conclusion: Bionetta is the only currently available approach that achieves deployable zero-knowledge machine learning on native EVM smart contracts with practical proof sizes and verification costs.

Abstract: In this report, we compare the performance of our UltraGroth-based
zero-knowledge machine learning framework Bionetta to other tools of similar
purpose such as EZKL, Lagrange's deep-prove, or zkml. The results show a
significant boost in the proving time for custom-crafted neural networks: they
can be proven even on mobile devices, enabling numerous client-side proving
applications. While our scheme increases the cost of one-time preprocessing
steps, such as circuit compilation and generating trusted setup, our approach
is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that is deployable on the native
EVM smart contracts without overwhelming proof size and verification overheads.

*Shuo Shao,Yiming Li,Hongwei Yao,Yifei Chen,Yuchen Yang,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ZeroPrint is a novel black-box fingerprinting method for LLMs that uses zeroth-order estimation to approximate gradients through semantic-preserving word substitutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance in identifying illicit model copies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box LLM fingerprinting methods fail to generate distinctive fingerprints because they rely on model outputs, which lose critical information about unique parameters due to non-linear functions. There's a need for more effective copyright protection for valuable LLM intellectual property.

Method: Leverages Fisher Information Theory to show gradients are more informative than outputs for fingerprinting. Uses zeroth-order estimation to approximate gradients in black-box setting by simulating input perturbations through semantic-preserving word substitutions, estimating the model's Jacobian matrix as fingerprint.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming existing black-box fingerprinting methods.

Conclusion: ZeroPrint successfully addresses the limitations of existing black-box fingerprinting by using gradient-based features, providing a more effective solution for LLM copyright protection through unique fingerprint identification.

Abstract: The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs)
makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about
copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to
address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic,
unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model
to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods
often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness
arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose
critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of
non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information
Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more
informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight,
we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich
gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint
overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input
perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows
ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint.
Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a
state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming
existing black-box methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DP-SynRAG is a privacy-preserving RAG framework that generates differentially private synthetic databases to avoid repeated noise injection and accumulated privacy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing private RAG methods rely on query-time differential privacy, which requires repeated noise injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss, limiting their application in sensitive domains.

Method: DP-SynRAG extends private prediction by using LLMs to generate differentially private synthetic RAG databases that mimic subsampled database records, allowing the synthetic text to be reused without additional privacy costs.

Result: Experiments show DP-SynRAG achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art private RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget.

Conclusion: DP-SynRAG offers a scalable solution for privacy-preserving RAG by avoiding repeated noise injection and enabling reusable synthetic databases.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding them in external knowledge. However, its application in sensitive
domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically
rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise
injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we
propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially
private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can
be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and
additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG
tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate
text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show
that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private
RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable
solution for privacy-preserving RAG.

*Riku Mochizuki,Shusuke Komatsu,Souta Noguchi,Kazuto Ataka*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes generative engines' vulnerability to poisoning attacks through web citations, introduces evaluation criteria to assess poisoning threats, and shows U.S. political answers have higher poisoning risk than Japan's.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative engines are vulnerable to poisoning attacks because anyone can publish web content, but existing citation evaluation focuses on faithfulness rather than which sources should be selected to defend against attacks.

Method: Introduces evaluation criteria that classify citation publisher attributes to estimate content-injection barrier and reveal poisoning threats. Experiments conducted in political domains in Japan and U.S. using these criteria.

Result: Citations from official party websites are 25%-45% in U.S. and 60%-65% in Japan, indicating higher poisoning risk for U.S. political answers. Sources with low content-injection barriers are frequently cited but poorly reflected in answers.

Conclusion: To mitigate poisoning threats, primary source publishers need to increase web content exposure in answers, but well-known techniques are limited by language differences.

Abstract: We analyze answers generated by generative engines (GEs) from the
perspectives of citation publishers and the content-injection barrier, defined
as the difficulty for attackers to manipulate answers to user prompts by
placing malicious content on the web. GEs integrate two functions: web search
and answer generation that cites web pages using large language models. Because
anyone can publish information on the web, GEs are vulnerable to poisoning
attacks. Existing studies of citation evaluation focus on how faithfully answer
content reflects cited sources, leaving unexamined which web sources should be
selected as citations to defend against poisoning attacks. To fill this gap, we
introduce evaluation criteria that assess poisoning threats using the citation
information contained in answers. Our criteria classify the publisher
attributes of citations to estimate the content-injection barrier thereby
revealing the threat of poisoning attacks in current GEs. We conduct
experiments in political domains in Japan and the United States (U.S.) using
our criteria and show that citations from official party websites (primary
sources) are approximately \(25\%\)--\(45\%\) in the U.S. and
\(60\%\)--\(65\%\) in Japan, indicating that U.S. political answers are at
higher risk of poisoning attacks. We also find that sources with low
content-injection barriers are frequently cited yet are poorly reflected in
answer content. To mitigate this threat, we discuss how publishers of primary
sources can increase exposure of their web content in answers and show that
well-known techniques are limited by language differences.

*Muris Sladić,Veronica Valeros,Carlos Catania,Sebastian Garcia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VelLMes is an AI-based deception framework that uses LLMs to simulate multiple protocols/services as honeypots, achieving 30% deception rate against human attackers and performing well against real Internet attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deception systems are limited to single services (mainly SSH) and lack extensive human evaluation. LLMs offer potential for creating realistic honeypots but need proper evaluation.

Method: Developed VelLMes framework using LLMs to simulate SSH Linux shell, MySQL, POP3, and HTTP protocols. Evaluated with unit tests for generative capabilities and 89 human attackers for deception capabilities. Also deployed 10 SSH honeypots on Internet.

Result: LLMs achieved 100% passing rate in unit tests with careful prompting. 30% of human attackers were deceived into thinking they interacted with real systems. Internet deployment showed LLM honeypots handle unstructured attacks effectively.

Conclusion: LLM-based deception systems like VelLMes can successfully simulate multiple protocols and effectively deceive both human attackers and automated Internet attacks, demonstrating the practical viability of AI-powered honeypots.

Abstract: There are very few SotA deception systems based on Large Language Models. The
existing ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH
shells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs -
lack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has
recently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and
practitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers
have demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking
honeytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as
honeypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,
which can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,
MySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus
VelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'
needs. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and
realism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities
and the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using
unit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful
prompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having
a 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception
capabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the
attackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were
assigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH
Linux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks. Analysis of
these attacks showed us that LLM honeypots simulating Linux shells can perform
well against unstructured and unexpected attacks on the Internet, responding
correctly to most of the issued commands.

TL;DR: RedTWIZ is an adaptive multi-turn red teaming framework for auditing LLM robustness in software development, featuring systematic assessment, diverse attack generation, and hierarchical planning to expose vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate and expose weaknesses in LLMs' robustness, particularly in AI-assisted software development contexts where conversational jailbreaks pose security risks.

Method: Combines three components: systematic assessment of LLM conversational jailbreaks, diverse generative multi-turn attack suite with compositional strategies, and hierarchical attack planner that adaptively targets specific LLM vulnerabilities.

Result: Experimental results show the multi-turn adversarial attack strategies successfully lead state-of-the-art LLMs to produce unsafe generations, demonstrating significant vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The framework effectively exposes LLM weaknesses, highlighting the urgent need for more research into enhancing LLM robustness against sophisticated multi-turn attacks.

Abstract: This paper presents the vision, scientific contributions, and technical
details of RedTWIZ: an adaptive and diverse multi-turn red teaming framework,
to audit the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-assisted software
development. Our work is driven by three major research streams: (1) robust and
systematic assessment of LLM conversational jailbreaks; (2) a diverse
generative multi-turn attack suite, supporting compositional, realistic and
goal-oriented jailbreak conversational strategies; and (3) a hierarchical
attack planner, which adaptively plans, serializes, and triggers attacks
tailored to specific LLM's vulnerabilities. Together, these contributions form
a unified framework -- combining assessment, attack generation, and strategic
planning -- to comprehensively evaluate and expose weaknesses in LLMs'
robustness. Extensive evaluation is conducted to systematically assess and
analyze the performance of the overall system and each component. Experimental
results demonstrate that our multi-turn adversarial attack strategies can
successfully lead state-of-the-art LLMs to produce unsafe generations,
highlighting the pressing need for more research into enhancing LLM's
robustness.

TL;DR: A strategy combining machine learning (CNNs and transformers) with traditional knot invariants (Jones polynomial) to recognize knots from photos, with the goal of robust knot classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that can automatically recognize knots from photos, bridging visual perception with topological analysis.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Machine learning (CNNs and transformers) to extract structural information from images and predict crossing numbers, 2) Symbolic reconstruction into planar diagram codes for computing quantum invariants like Jones polynomial.

Result: Simple baselines show that lightweight CNN and transformer architectures can recover meaningful structural information from knot images and predict crossing numbers.

Conclusion: The complementary approach of machine learning handling noisy visual data and invariants enforcing rigorous topological distinctions provides a promising strategy for robust knot classification from images.

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StruSR is a structure-aware symbolic regression framework that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract physical priors from time series data, guiding genetic programming with derivative-based structural information and masking-based attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression methods lack mechanisms to extract structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect a system's global behavior governed by physical laws.

Method: Uses trained PINNs to extract locally structured physical priors via local Taylor expansions, introduces masking-based attribution to quantify subtree contributions, and employs genetic programming with hybrid fitness function that minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch.

Result: Experiments on benchmark PDE systems show StruSR improves convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines.

Conclusion: StruSR offers a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery by leveraging physical priors from PINNs to guide symbolic expression evolution.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an amortized framework that enhances pretrained Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) with a lightweight controller network for improved guidance in data assimilation tasks for chaotic spatiotemporal PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) is underexplored, and existing methods for data assimilation in chaotic PDEs are computationally expensive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations.

Method: An amortized framework that augments pretrained ARDMs with a lightweight controller network trained offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal cost objective.

Result: The method consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes, reducing data assimilation inference to a single forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses computational limitations and forecast drift issues in data assimilation for chaotic PDEs, offering superior performance while avoiding expensive adjoint computations and optimizations during inference.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine-learned operators (MLOs) fail at zero-shot super-resolution and multi-resolution inference due to aliasing and brittleness, but a simple multi-resolution training protocol can overcome these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether MLOs can perform zero-shot super-resolution and multi-resolution inference, addressing the core challenge of modeling continuous phenomena with discrete representations in scientific machine learning.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of MLOs' multi-resolution inference capabilities, decoupling the problem into frequency extrapolation and resolution interpolation. Proposed a simple, computationally-efficient, data-driven multi-resolution training protocol.

Result: MLOs fail at both frequency extrapolation and resolution interpolation in zero-shot manner, showing brittleness and susceptibility to aliasing when inferring at resolutions different from training data.

Conclusion: MLOs cannot perform accurate zero-shot multi-resolution inference, but the proposed multi-resolution training protocol successfully overcomes aliasing and provides robust multi-resolution generalization.

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SaFeR-VLM is a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning, addressing the "Reasoning Tax" phenomenon where MLRMs amplify safety risks under adversarial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses mainly act at output level without constraining reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. The "Reasoning Tax" phenomenon shows MLRMs amplify safety risks under adversarial prompts.

Method: Proposes SaFeR-VLM with four components: QI-Safe-10K dataset, safety-aware rollout with reflection/correction, structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional criteria, and GRPO optimization that reinforces safe trajectories.

Result: SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves 70.13 and 78.97 on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing larger models. SaFeR-VLM-7B surpasses GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by 6.47 and 16.76 points on safety without helpfulness degradation.

Conclusion: The framework shifts safety from passive safeguard to active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning with robustness against both explicit and implicit risks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

### [230] [The Markovian Thinker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06557)
*Milad Aghajohari,Kamran Chitsaz,Amirhossein Kazemnejad,Sarath Chandar,Alessandro Sordoni,Aaron Courville,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Markovian Thinking paradigm enables efficient long-chain reasoning by structuring thoughts into fixed-size chunks with linear compute, outperforming standard RL approaches that suffer from quadratic overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL for reasoning LLMs has unbounded state size and quadratic compute overhead as thoughts lengthen, making long-chain reasoning inefficient and costly.

Method: Proposed Delethink RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks with context resets and short carryover text, training policies to write sufficient state for seamless continuation.

Result: 1.5B model achieves 24K token reasoning with 8K chunks, matching/surpassing 24K LongCoT-RL. At 96K thinking length, Delethink costs 7 H100-months vs 27 for LongCoT-RL, with continued scaling improvements.

Conclusion: Redesigning the thinking environment enables efficient long reasoning without quadratic overhead, opening path to scalable reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

TL;DR: SpherePair is a novel deep constrained clustering method that uses angular constraint embedding to effectively separate representation learning from clustering, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep constrained clustering methods are limited by anchors in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting scalability and real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes SpherePair loss with geometric formulation that encodes pairwise constraints and leads to clustering-friendly embeddings in angular space, separating representation learning from clustering.

Result: SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes need to specify exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid cluster number inference, and shows superior performance on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: SpherePair demonstrates superior performance, scalability, and real-world effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art deep constrained clustering methods, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

### [232] [High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06955)
*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixout is a regularization technique that improves domain generalization by probabilistically swapping fine-tuned weights with pre-trained counterparts during training, achieving comparable performance to ensemble methods with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble methods for domain generalization are computationally expensive, while Dropout tends to over-regularize pre-trained models by disrupting critical representations. A lightweight alternative that maintains adaptation while retaining prior knowledge is needed.

Method: Mixout probabilistically swaps fine-tuned weights with pre-trained counterparts during training. High masking probabilities (0.9 for ViTs, 0.8 for ResNets) are used to penalize deviations from pre-trained parameters and reduce computational overhead.

Result: High-rate Mixout achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble methods across five benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, DomainNet) while reducing gradient computation by up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%.

Conclusion: Mixout provides an effective and efficient alternative to ensemble methods for domain generalization, balancing adaptation with retention of pre-trained knowledge while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMixout improves finetuning robustness by replacing fixed anchors with adaptive EMA snapshots and regulating masking frequency, achieving better accuracy and distribution shift performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning vision models improves in-domain accuracy but reduces robustness under distribution shift. The paper aims to enhance robustness while maintaining accuracy gains.

Method: Introduces GMixout, which uses exponential moving-average snapshots as adaptive anchors, regulates masking frequency via explicit hyperparameter, and employs sparse-kernel implementation for efficiency.

Result: GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy beyond zero-shot performance and surpasses Model Soups and parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GMixout effectively balances in-domain accuracy and distribution shift robustness through adaptive anchoring and controlled masking, enabling efficient training on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

### [234] [Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07018)
*Dung Hoang-Anh,Cuong Pham Trung Le,Jianfei Cai,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot quantization method that considers model sharpness during synthetic data generation to improve generalization, using gradient matching between synthetic and real data gradients without needing real validation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous zero-shot quantization methods generate synthetic data without considering the sharpness of the quantized model, even though low sharpness is known to improve generalization. This work aims to incorporate sharpness minimization into the data generation process.

Method: The method minimizes sharpness by maximizing gradient matching between reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and real validation data. It approximates this without real validation data by matching gradients between each generated sample and its neighbors.

Result: Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in low-bit quantization settings.

Conclusion: Considering quantized model sharpness in synthetic data generation through gradient matching significantly enhances generalization performance in zero-shot quantization.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how semantics affect localization performance and robustness in a self-supervised contrastive semantic localization framework, finding that the model learns noise-robust semantic relationships for explainable registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how semantics influence localization performance and robustness, and whether models filter environmental noise while prioritizing distinctive landmarks over routine clutter.

Method: Trained a localization network on original and perturbed maps, conducted post-hoc introspection analysis using interpretability methods like integrated gradients and attention weights, and performed semantic class ablation.

Result: Integrated gradients and attention weights were the most reliable probes; frequent objects are often down-weighted; the model learns noise-robust, semantically salient relationships.

Conclusion: The model successfully learns noise-robust semantic relationships that enable explainable registration under challenging visual and structural variations.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stateful multi-agent evolutionary search framework improves unit test generation by combining persistent inference-time state, adversarial mutation, and evolutionary preservation to generate robust edge cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stateless inference struggles with multi-step reasoning tasks, and task-specific fine-tuning remains brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies.

Method: Training-free framework using persistent inference-time state, adversarial mutation, and evolutionary preservation with specialized agents that sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates.

Result: Achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines on HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini benchmarks using Llama, Gemma, and GPT models.

Conclusion: Combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation, yielding a generalist agent capable of discovering robust edge cases across unseen codebases.

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.
