### [1] [Cache Mechanism for Agent RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02919)
*Shuhang Lin,Zhencan Peng,Lingyao Li,Xiao Lin,Xi Zhu,Yongfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC is a novel caching framework that dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for LLM agents, reducing storage to 0.015% of original while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agent-level cache management in RAG systems remains underexplored, particularly for constructing and maintaining compact, relevant corpora dynamically tailored to each agent's needs.

Method: ARC synthesizes historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached items in embedding space to automatically maintain a high-relevance cache without annotations.

Result: ARC reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of original corpus while achieving up to 79.8% has-answer rate and reducing average retrieval latency by 80% across three retrieval datasets.

Conclusion: ARC can drastically enhance both efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents through dynamic cache management.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been
propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models
access to vast external knowledge bases. Despite RAG's success in improving
agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing,
maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to
each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent
RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that
dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing
historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached
items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance
cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our
experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to
0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and
reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can
drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.

### [2] [Automatic Machine Translation Detection Using a Surrogate Multilingual Translation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02958)
*Cristian García-Romero,Miquel Esplà-Gomis,Felipe Sánchez-Martínez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes using internal representations from multilingual MT models to detect machine-translated text, achieving 5+ percentage point accuracy gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large parallel corpora used in MT systems contain substantial machine-generated translations, which degrade translation quality when used in training, making filtering essential.

Method: Exploits internal representations of a surrogate multilingual MT model to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, particularly for non-English language pairs, with at least 5 percentage points accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The approach effectively filters machine-translated content and is crucial for building high-quality MT systems.

Abstract: Modern machine translation (MT) systems depend on large parallel corpora,
often collected from the Internet. However, recent evidence indicates that (i)
a substantial portion of these texts are machine-generated translations, and
(ii) an overreliance on such synthetic content in training data can
significantly degrade translation quality. As a result, filtering out non-human
translations is becoming an essential pre-processing step in building
high-quality MT systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach that
directly exploits the internal representations of a surrogate multilingual MT
model to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
techniques, particularly for non-English language pairs, achieving gains of at
least 5 percentage points of accuracy.

### [3] [LEGO-Eval: Towards Fine-Grained Evaluation on Synthesizing 3D Embodied Environments with Tool Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03001)
*Gyeom Hwangbo,Hyungjoo Chae,Minseok Kang,Hyeonjong Ju,Soohyun Oh,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEGO-Eval is a framework for evaluating 3D scene generation from fine-grained instructions, addressing limitations of current methods like CLIPScore and VLMs. It introduces LEGO-Bench benchmark showing current methods achieve only 10% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-generated 3D scenes lack realistic layouts and object attributes due to coarse-grained instructions, which leads to poor training of embodied agents that learn unrealistic priors diverging from real-world physics and semantics.

Method: Introduces LEGO-Eval framework with diverse tools to explicitly ground scene components for accurate alignment assessment, and LEGO-Bench benchmark with detailed instructions specifying complex real-world layouts and attributes.

Result: LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in scene-instruction alignment assessment. Current generation methods achieve at most 10% success rate in fully aligning with fine-grained instructions.

Conclusion: There are significant limitations in current 3D scene generation methods, and LEGO-Eval provides a more reliable evaluation framework for assessing alignment between fine-grained instructions and generated scenes.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic
spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this
problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,
advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions
that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic
scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to
learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,
degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment
between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for
effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and
vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.
This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D
scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address
this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse
tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate
alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed
instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world
environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge
by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with
LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.
Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in
generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.

### [4] [Targeted Error Correction in Knowledge Distillation: Small Language Models Surpass GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03005)
*Hee-Jin Lee,Zhen Guo,Luchao Jin,Morteza Moazami Goudarzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARF pipeline enables smaller open-source LLMs to outperform larger proprietary models in customer service summarization through error analysis, targeted revision, and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cost efficiency and data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy in customer service summarization tasks using smaller open-source models.

Method: Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline: 1) Analyze and categorize errors from teacher model (GPT-3.5), 2) Use compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B) for targeted revision to create refined training data, 3) Fine-tune smaller student model (Llama 3.1 8B) on refined data.

Result: The fine-tuned smaller student model (Llama 3.1 8B) achieved superior summarization performance compared to GPT-3.5.

Conclusion: ARF pipeline provides a generalizable framework for enhancing open-source LLMs across diverse downstream applications while improving cost efficiency and data privacy.

Abstract: We introduce an Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline that enables smaller
open-source language models (LLMs) to surpass substantially larger proprietary
models in customer service summarization tasks. The pipeline first analyzes and
categorizes common errors in summaries produced by a teacher model (GPT-3.5),
then performs a targeted revision using a compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B)
to generate high-quality, refined training data. Fine-tuning a smaller student
model (Llama 3.1 8B) on this refined data resulted in superior summarization
performance compared to GPT-3.5. The ARF pipeline improves cost efficiency and
data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy, illustrating a
generalizable framework for enhancing open-source LLMs across diverse
downstream applications.

### [5] [Data-Efficient Adaptation and a Novel Evaluation Method for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03034)
*Yan Cathy Hua,Paul Denny,Jörg Wicker,Katerina Taškova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FTS-OBP evaluation method for ABSA, studies small language models in education domain ABSA, and releases education review resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABSA research is concentrated in commercial domains, leaving education and healthcare underserved. Domain adaptation challenges and rigid evaluation methods hinder progress in low-resource areas.

Method: Proposed FTS-OBP evaluation method, studied small decoder-only generative models (<7B parameters) using data-free (in-context learning, weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods with multitask strategy.

Result: Small models (1.5-3.8B) surpassed proprietary large models and approached benchmark results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. FTS-OBP maintained strong correlation with traditional metrics while accommodating boundary variations.

Conclusion: The work enables effective ABSA in low-resource domains through improved evaluation methods and demonstrates that small models can achieve competitive performance with minimal data and computational resources.

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining
approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific
entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid
growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in
commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet
low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation
challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive
in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.
Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly
rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent
the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through
three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text
Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates
realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation
with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present
the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;
<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education
review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and
weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask
fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling
1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark
results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first
public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in
low-resource domains.

### [6] [ROBoto2: An Interactive System and Dataset for LLM-assisted Clinical Trial Risk of Bias Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03048)
*Anthony Hevia,Sanjana Chintalapati,Veronica Ka Wai Lai,Thanh Tam Nguyen,Wai-Tat Wong,Terry Klassen,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROBOTO2 is an open-source web platform that uses LLMs to assist with risk of bias assessment in clinical trials, streamlining the traditionally labor-intensive ROB2 annotation process through an interactive interface with PDF parsing and human-in-the-loop review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive nature of traditional risk of bias (ROB2) assessment in clinical trials and leverage large language models to automate and streamline this critical systematic review process.

Method: Developed a web-based platform combining PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented LLM prompting, and human-in-the-loop review. Users upload clinical trial reports and receive preliminary answers with supporting evidence for ROB2 signaling questions, with real-time feedback capabilities.

Result: Created and released a dataset of 521 pediatric clinical trial reports (8954 signaling questions with 1202 evidence passages) annotated using both manual and LLM-assisted methods. Benchmarked ROB2 performance for 4 LLMs and analyzed current model capabilities.

Conclusion: ROBOTO2 provides a publicly available platform for LLM-assisted risk of bias assessment, with released code and data to foster reproducibility and adoption, while highlighting ongoing challenges in automating systematic review processes.

Abstract: We present ROBOTO2, an open-source, web-based platform for large language
model (LLM)-assisted risk of bias (ROB) assessment of clinical trials. ROBOTO2
streamlines the traditionally labor-intensive ROB v2 (ROB2) annotation process
via an interactive interface that combines PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented LLM
prompting, and human-in-the-loop review. Users can upload clinical trial
reports, receive preliminary answers and supporting evidence for ROB2 signaling
questions, and provide real-time feedback or corrections to system suggestions.
ROBOTO2 is publicly available at https://roboto2.vercel.app/, with code and
data released to foster reproducibility and adoption. We construct and release
a dataset of 521 pediatric clinical trial reports (8954 signaling questions
with 1202 evidence passages), annotated using both manually and LLM-assisted
methods, serving as a benchmark and enabling future research. Using this

### [7] [Reading Between the Lines: The One-Sided Conversation Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03056)
*Victoria Ebert,Rishabh Singh,Tuochao Chen,Noah A. Smith,Shyamnath Gollakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the one-sided conversation problem (1SC) where only one side of a dialogue is available, and presents methods for reconstructing missing turns and generating summaries from partial transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world conversational AI faces constraints where only one side of conversations can be recorded (telemedicine, call centers, smart glasses), creating a need to work with incomplete dialogue data.

Method: Used prompting and finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor datasets; evaluated with human A/B testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics; explored techniques like using one future turn, utterance length information, and placeholder prompting.

Result: Found that access to one future turn and utterance length improves reconstruction; placeholder prompting reduces hallucination; large models work with prompting while smaller ones need finetuning; high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing turns.

Conclusion: The 1SC problem is a novel challenge with promising results that advance privacy-aware conversational AI.

Abstract: Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one
side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and
smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC):
inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1)
reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2)
generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and
finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B
testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and
information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder
prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate
promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.
Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing
turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that
mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.

### [8] [PolyNorm: Few-Shot LLM-Based Text Normalization for Text-to-Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03080)
*Michel Wong,Ali Alshehri,Sophia Kao,Haotian He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyNorm is a prompt-based text normalization system using LLMs that reduces manual rule engineering and enables multilingual coverage with minimal human intervention, outperforming production systems across 8 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text normalization systems require substantial engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges for language coverage, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Proposed PolyNorm, a prompt-based approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) with a language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation.

Result: Experiments across eight languages show consistent reductions in word error rate (WER) compared to a production-grade system.

Conclusion: The approach reduces reliance on manually crafted rules and enables broader linguistic applicability, with the release of PolyNorm-Benchmark dataset to support further research.

Abstract: Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents.
Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial
engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language
coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a
prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to
reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic
applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a
language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed
to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments
across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER)
compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we
release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of
text normalization phenomena.

### [9] [A Computational Approach to Analyzing Disrupted Language in Schizophrenia: Integrating Surprisal and Coherence Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03089)
*Gowtham Premananth,Carol Espy-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes language disruptions in schizophrenia using computational linguistic measures (surprisal and semantic coherence) to differentiate patients from healthy controls and correlate with symptom severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language disruptions in schizophrenia reflect cognitive disturbances and can serve as objective markers for diagnosis and symptom severity assessment.

Method: Computational linguistic analysis using surprisal and semantic coherence measures applied to spontaneous language production from schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

Result: The study found differences in surprisal and semantic coherence between schizophrenia subjects and healthy controls, with these measures changing according to symptom severity levels.

Conclusion: Computational linguistic measures (surprisal and semantic coherence) can effectively characterize language disruptions in schizophrenia and serve as objective markers for diagnosis and symptom severity assessment.

Abstract: Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia
symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired
discourse coherence. These abnormalities in spontaneous language production
reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as
objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This
study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms
of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By
computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational
models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further
insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures
change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.

### [10] [CARMA: Comprehensive Automatically-annotated Reddit Mental Health Dataset for Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03102)
*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARMA is the first large-scale automatically annotated Arabic Reddit dataset for mental health detection, covering six conditions and enabling classification experiments that show promise for advancing mental health detection in Arabic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early mental health detection is challenging for Arabic-speaking populations due to limited resources, cultural stigma, and lack of annotated datasets, while most research focuses on English.

Method: Created CARMA dataset from Arabic Reddit posts with automatic annotation for six mental health conditions and control group. Conducted lexical/semantic analysis and classification experiments using various models from shallow classifiers to large language models.

Result: CARMA surpasses existing resources in scale and diversity. Classification experiments demonstrated the dataset's utility for mental health detection in Arabic, revealing linguistic markers of specific conditions.

Conclusion: The study shows promise for advancing mental health detection in underrepresented languages like Arabic through large-scale automatically annotated datasets and computational approaches.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection
remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where
resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to
cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language
mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due
to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first
automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset
encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and
Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both
scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of
lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the
linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the
dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform
classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to
large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental
health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.

### [11] [Control Barrier Function for Aligning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03121)
*Yuya Miyaoka,Masaki Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A control-based framework using Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to align LLMs without fine-tuning, ensuring user-desirable text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure large language models generate user-desirable text through safety interventions without requiring fine-tuning of the baseline model.

Method: Applies CBF safety filter to predicted tokens from baseline LLM, allowing intervention in generated text as an add-on component.

Result: Implemented with open-source language models to generate positive text, demonstrating the framework's practical application.

Conclusion: The CBF-based safety filter provides an effective add-on solution for LLM alignment that doesn't require model fine-tuning and can directly leverage existing evaluation models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language
models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure
user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety
filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in
the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this
safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes
without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model
regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter
design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source
language models, aiming to generate positive text.

### [12] [MME-CC: A Challenging Multi-Modal Evaluation Benchmark of Cognitive Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03146)
*Kaiyuan Zhang,Chenghao Yang,Zhoufutu Wen,Sihang Yuan,Qiuyue Wang,Chaoyi Huang,Guosheng Zhu,He Wang,Huawenyu Lu,Jianing Wen,Jianpeng Jiao,Lishu Luo,Longxiang Liu,Sijin Wu,Xiaolei Zhu,Xuanliang Zhang,Ge Zhang,Yi Lin,Guang Shi,Chaoyou Fu,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-CC is a vision-grounded benchmark that evaluates multimodal large language models' cognitive capacity across 11 reasoning tasks in spatial, geometric, and knowledge-based categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal benchmarks overemphasize textual reasoning and fail to systematically assess vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving MLLMs' cognitive capacity insufficiently evaluated.

Method: Introduces MME-CC benchmark with 11 reasoning tasks organized into three categories (spatial, geometric, knowledge-based), and conducts extensive experiments on 16 representative MLLMs.

Result: Closed-source models lead overall (Gemini-2.5-Pro: 42.66 vs GLM-4.5V: 30.45), spatial and geometric reasoning remain weak (≤30%), with common error patterns including orientation mistakes and poor counterfactual adherence.

Conclusion: The work aims to catalyze a shift toward treating cognitive capacity as central to MLLM evaluation and design, revealing significant gaps in vision-centric reasoning abilities.

Abstract: As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in
human cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe
vision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either
overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing
vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs
insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC
(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded
benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three
fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and
knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'
cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct
extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that
closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.
30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak
(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,
including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and
poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that
Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->
verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a
shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both
evaluation and model design.

*Srishti Yadav,Jasmina Gajcin,Erik Miehling,Elizabeth Daly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs as judges to predict and explain AI risks from different stakeholder perspectives, generating interpretable policies and visualizing conflicts in risk perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is essential for responsible deployment, as stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns.

Method: Uses LLMs as judges with Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method to generate stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies and interactive visualization showing conflict emergence across perspectives.

Result: Demonstrated with three real-world AI use cases (medical AI, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection), showing stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns.

Conclusion: Emphasizes importance of stakeholder-aware explanations to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.

Abstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is
essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for
stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict
and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our
framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how
different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate
our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous
vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive
visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder
perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show
that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and
conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these
stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more
transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance
goals.

### [14] [Measuring Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in LLMs: Empirical Evaluation on ID and OOD QA Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03166)
*Kevin Wang,Subre Abdoul Moktar,Jia Li,Kangshuo Li,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive empirical study evaluating 12 uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs in QA tasks, finding information-based methods work best for in-distribution data while density-based methods excel for out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring trustworthiness of LLM outputs is crucial as they become more pervasive, and uncertainty estimation plays a key role in assessing reliability.

Method: Evaluated 12 UE methods using 4 quality metrics (including LLMScore) on QA tasks across in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, examining both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Information-based methods using token/sequence probabilities perform best in ID settings; density-based methods and P(True) excel in OOD contexts; semantic consistency methods show reliable performance across different scenarios.

Conclusion: Different uncertainty estimation methods have distinct strengths - no single method is optimal for all situations, with performance varying between in-distribution and out-of-distribution contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly pervasive, finding
applications across many industries and disciplines. Ensuring the
trustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE)
plays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to
examine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE
methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM
criticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in
Question-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Our analysis reveals that information-based
methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally
well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of
the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit
superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in
capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty. Semantic consistency methods,
which assess variability in generated answers, show reliable performance across
different datasets and generation metrics. These methods generally perform well
but may not be optimal for every situation.

### [15] [BengaliMoralBench: A Benchmark for Auditing Moral Reasoning in Large Language Models within Bengali Language and Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03180)
*Shahriyar Zaman Ridoy,Azmine Toushik Wasi,Koushik Ahamed Tonmoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BengaliMoralBench is the first large-scale ethics benchmark for Bengali language and culture, evaluating multilingual LLMs' alignment with local ethical norms across five moral domains using three ethical lenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ethics benchmarks are English-centric and shaped by Western frameworks, overlooking cultural nuances critical for real-world deployment of LLMs in South Asia, particularly for Bengali speakers.

Method: Created BengaliMoralBench covering five moral domains with 50 culturally relevant subtopics, annotated via native-speaker consensus using Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics lenses. Conducted systematic zero-shot evaluation of multilingual LLMs with unified prompting protocol.

Result: Performance varied widely (50-91% accuracy) across models, with qualitative analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense reasoning, and moral fairness.

Conclusion: BengaliMoralBench provides foundation for responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual settings.

Abstract: As multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across South Asia,
their alignment with local ethical norms, particularly for Bengali, which is
spoken by over 285 million people and ranked 6th globally, remains
underexplored. Existing ethics benchmarks are largely English-centric and
shaped by Western frameworks, overlooking cultural nuances critical for
real-world deployment. To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the
first large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural
contexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting,
Family Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally
relevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus
using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct
systematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including
Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and
standard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative
analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense
reasoning, and moral fairness. BengaliMoralBench provides a foundation for
responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting
the deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual
settings such as Bangladesh.

*Wenchang Lei,Ping Zou,Yue Wang,Feng Sun,Lei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Language Graph Model (LGM) enhances LLM conceptual understanding by extracting meta-relations from text and using a reflection mechanism, outperforming traditional RAG methods without requiring text truncation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguous or conceptually misaligned terms in user instructions, limiting their semantic understanding capabilities.

Method: Extracts meta-relations (inheritance, alias, composition) from natural language, employs reflection mechanism for validation, and uses Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm to dynamically supply relations and descriptions to LLM.

Result: LGM consistently outperforms existing RAG baselines on standard benchmarks and enables processing texts of any length without truncation.

Conclusion: The proposed LGM approach effectively enhances LLM conceptual clarity and interpretation capabilities, overcoming limitations of conventional RAG methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet
struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned
terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity
by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural
language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these
meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these
relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM,
improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses.
Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely
on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to
process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing
RAG baselines.

*Shaghayegh Kolli,Richard Rosenbaum,Timo Cavelius,Lasse Strothe,Andrii Lata,Jana Diesner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid fact-checking system combining LLMs, knowledge graphs, and web search agents achieves high accuracy on FEVER benchmark without task-specific fine-tuning, with modular design and fallback strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of LLMs (lack of reliable grounding) and knowledge graphs (limited coverage/latency) by integrating their complementary strengths for robust fact-checking.

Method: Three-step pipeline: 1) KG retrieval from DBpedia for rapid lookups, 2) LM-based classification with task-specific prompts, 3) Web search agent for cases with insufficient KG coverage.

Result: Achieves F1 score of 0.93 on FEVER benchmark Supported/Refuted split; frequently finds valid evidence for claims originally labeled as Not Enough Information.

Conclusion: Presents a modular, open-source fact-checking pipeline with generalization across datasets and effective fallback strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can
lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time,
knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence,
yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge
graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking
approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system
comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid
one-hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a
task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based
logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient.
Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the
Supported/Refuted split without task-specific fine-tuning. To address Not
enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that
our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled
as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM
reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking
pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.

*Souvik Rana,Arul Menezes,Ashish Kulkarni,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IndicSuperTokenizer combines subword and multi-word tokenization with language-specific pre-tokenization for Indic multilingual LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art fertility scores and 44% inference throughput improvement over LLaMA4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subword tokenization methods like BPE are underexplored for multilingual settings, especially for Indic languages with diverse scripts and rich morphological variation, requiring more linguistically aligned tokenization.

Method: Combines subword and multi-word tokenization with language-specific pre-tokenization to create linguistically aligned tokens for Indic languages.

Result: Achieves 39.5% higher average fertility score than LLaMA4 and 18% higher than Sutra, with 44% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining comparable benchmark performance.

Conclusion: The proposed tokenizer design effectively addresses multilingual tokenization challenges for Indic languages, demonstrating robustness across various training configurations and vocabulary sizes.

Abstract: Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training
efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing
effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to
diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in
multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a
tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and
multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading
to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in
fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data,
our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by
18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in
inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on
English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across
tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and
pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design
choices.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of 4 open-source LLMs (Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct, Orca-mini-v3-7b) and GPT-3.5 on QA tasks using RAG in computer science literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare performance of different LLMs in question-answering tasks across diverse domains using Retrieval Augmented Generation to reduce hallucination.

Method: Used RAG support for QA tasks in computer science literature, evaluated with accuracy/precision for binary questions, human/Gemini expert ranking, and cosine similarity for long-answer questions.

Result: GPT-3.5 with RAG performed best overall. Among open-source models, Mistral-7b-instruct performed best on both binary and long-answer questions. Orca-mini-v3-7b had shortest latency, LLaMa2-7b-chat had highest latency.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs can compete with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 when paired with better infrastructure, with Mistral-7b-instruct showing strong performance among open-source options.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to
enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination.
Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in
question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance
of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,
Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA
tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation
metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary
questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,
alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired
with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its
status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's
Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary
and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b
reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas
LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research
underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with
proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCALE introduces width upscaling for continual pre-training by inserting lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing pre-trained parameters, preserving original functionality while increasing capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in continual pre-training depends more on scaling the right structure than just scaling parameters, addressing the forgetting problem in continual learning.

Method: SCALE architecture with Persistent Preservation (freezing pre-trained weights) and Collaborative Adaptation (selective training of expansion components), implemented as SCALE-Preserve, SCALE-Adapt, and SCALE-Route variants.

Result: Mitigates severe forgetting on synthetic benchmarks, achieves less forgetting on English evaluations while gaining competitive performance on Korean benchmarks, offering better stability-plasticity trade-off.

Conclusion: SCALE provides an effective approach for continual pre-training that preserves base model functionality while enabling new knowledge acquisition with minimal interference.

Abstract: We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that
progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling
parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that
inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all
pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies
and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original
functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,
which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented
initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative
Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to
acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as
SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and
SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing
between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography
benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion
while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean
corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and
competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best
overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when
preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and
adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning
setups.

### [22] [How to Evaluate Speech Translation with Source-Aware Neural MT Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03295)
*Mauro Cettolo,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Sara Papi,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces source-aware metrics for speech-to-text translation evaluation using ASR transcripts and back-translations as synthetic sources, with a novel cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ST evaluation ignores source audio information, while recent MT metrics show source-aware approaches achieve better correlation with human judgments. However, extending this to ST is challenging due to audio sources and lack of reliable alignments.

Method: Two strategies for generating textual proxies: ASR transcripts and back-translations of reference translations, plus a novel two-step cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to handle alignment mismatches between synthetic sources and references.

Result: Experiments on 79 language pairs and 6 ST systems show ASR transcripts are more reliable when WER < 20%, while back-translations are computationally cheaper but still effective. The re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT metrics in ST evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more accurate and principled evaluation methodologies for speech translation by effectively incorporating source information through synthetic proxies and addressing alignment challenges.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically
performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference
translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the
limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from
the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that
neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with
human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the
source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments
between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct
the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular
focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not
available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual
proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and
back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch
between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried
out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with
diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts
constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word
error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a
computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT
metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled
evaluation methodologies for speech translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of reasoning MLLMs in clinical tasks shows marginal performance improvements from thinking mode activation, with suboptimal results on complex medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously assess how enhanced reasoning processes in dual-state MLLMs impact performance and reliability in clinical applications.

Method: Evaluated thinking mode capabilities of Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets.

Result: Thinking mode activation provides only marginal improvements over standard non-thinking mode for most tasks. Performance on complex medical tasks like open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal.

Conclusion: Current reasoning MLLMs need domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration to effectively handle complex clinical tasks.

Abstract: A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is
the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their
internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode")
alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models
to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating
a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these
"dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning
processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical
tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two
leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We
assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and
ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the
thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for
the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as
open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,
highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced
methods for medical knowledge integration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically identify and evaluate the growing developments of generative AI in bioinformatics across genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery.

Method: Used preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods with six research questions to evaluate GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive performance, and specialization.

Result: Specialized GenAI models outperformed general-purpose models across multiple bioinformatics subfields, showing significant benefits in molecular analysis, data integration, structural modeling, and functional prediction with improved accuracy and reduced errors.

Conclusion: GenAI demonstrates transformative potential in bioinformatics, though challenges remain in scalability, data biases, and generalizability, with future directions focusing on robust evaluation and biologically grounded modeling.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative
approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics,
proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To
systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review
proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to
evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive
performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for
advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological
analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics
subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),
which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern
recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model
architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to
targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant
benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data
integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.
RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and
synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests
the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that
impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust
evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular
datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as
CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly
support the training and generalization of GenAI models.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Brit Youngmann,Yaniv Nemcovsky,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB) to uncover hidden biases in safety-aligned LLMs that are masked by refusal responses in standard QA evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation methods for LLMs often misinterpret refusal responses as positive fairness measurements, creating a false sense of fairness and overlooking deeper biased preferences encoded in the models' latent space.

Method: Proposes SBB using activation steering to reduce model refusals during QA, allowing detection of silenced biases without relying on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries that risk introducing additional biases.

Result: The approach was demonstrated on multiple LLMs, revealing alarming distinctions between models' direct responses and their underlying fairness issues, exposing biases that were previously concealed by safety alignment.

Conclusion: SBB provides a scalable fairness evaluation framework that can expand to new demographic groups and subjects, encouraging development of fair models beyond the masking effects of alignment training.

Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly
widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential
and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness
of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize
standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook
deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive
fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,
we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences
encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by
safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases
often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which
present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with
additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to
uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals
during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,
presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future
development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment
training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings
expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their
underlying fairness issues.

*Yunbo Long,Yuhan Liu,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQ-Negotiator enables small language models (SLMs) to outperform much larger LLMs in credit negotiations by using emotional personas and strategic reasoning, achieving better debt recovery while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally expensive and privacy-invasive for on-device applications, while SLMs have a performance gap in handling emotionally complex negotiations. There's a need for privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can handle emotional dynamics effectively.

Method: EQ-Negotiator integrates game theory with Hidden Markov Models to learn and track debtor emotional states online without pre-training. It equips SLMs with strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while maintaining ethical standards.

Result: A 7B parameter model with EQ-Negotiator achieved better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs 10x larger, even against adversarial strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim.

Conclusion: Strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is critical for automated negotiation success. EQ-Negotiator advances persona modeling to dynamic emotional architectures that enable effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators for edge deployment.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has
set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy
requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device
applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client
interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative,
they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing
emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This
paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability
gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates
game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional
states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs
with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating
conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent
simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial
debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show
that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt
recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its
size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles
to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints.
Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw
model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation,
paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators
that can operate on the edge.

*Shenghao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LFC-DA is a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline for logical data augmentation that maps text to propositional expressions, compiles rules, and systematically generates diverse, logically rigorous questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for logical data augmentation either rely on costly human annotation or use LLMs directly, which produces uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples.

Method: LFC-DA maps logical text to propositional expressions, compiles a compact rule library, performs bounded state-space search to discover valid formulas, and verbalizes them back into natural-language questions.

Result: Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA datasets show significant improvements in logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained models.

Conclusion: LFC-DA effectively enables LLM-guided logical data augmentation by ensuring both diversity and logical rigor under propositional logic.

Abstract: For complex logical data augmentation, heavy reliance on human annotation is
costly, whereas direct generation with large language models yields
uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples. To address this, we present
LFC-DA, a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline: logical text is first mapped to
propositional expressions, a compact rule library is compiled, and a bounded
state-space search systematically discovers valid formulas that are then
verbalized back into natural-language questions, ensuring both diversity and
logical rigor under propositional logic. Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA show
significant improvements in the logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained
models, confirming the effectiveness of LFC-DA for LLM-guided logical data
augmentation.

*Saumitra Yadav,Manish Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Asymmetric BPE with different merge operations for source and target languages outperforms symmetric BPE in machine translation, especially for low-resource language pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MT research uses symmetric BPE with fixed hyperparameters, but this uniform approach may not be optimal across different language pairs and data sizes.

Method: Investigated BPE segmentation recipes across various data volumes and language pairs, comparing symmetric vs asymmetric BPE where source and target have different numbers of merge operations.

Result: Asymmetric BPE significantly improved MT performance, with statistically significant gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in low-resource settings, and improvements in 10 out of 12 systems across six language pairs.

Conclusion: Using high NMO for source (4K-32K) and low NMO for target (0.5K-2K) provides optimal results, particularly benefiting low-resource machine translation.

Abstract: Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set
of hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train
tokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that
this uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different
language pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes
across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system
performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target
languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the
symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K
sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant
($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in
low-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language
pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),
observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems
compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K
to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results,
particularly benefiting low-resource MT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs struggle with rare properties in relation extraction; best solution is training sets where each property appears above a threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how small language models handle both datatype and object properties for complete RDF graph extraction, focusing on the bottleneck of long-tail distribution of rare properties.

Method: Evaluated several strategies: stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation.

Result: The best strategy is to build training sets where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given threshold, enabling equal performance across unbalanced target properties.

Conclusion: Findings provide practical guidance for training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future semantic relation extraction work.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have shown promises for relation extraction (RE)
when extracting RDF triples guided by SHACL shapes focused on common datatype
properties. This paper investigates how SLMs handle both datatype and object
properties for a complete RDF graph extraction. We show that the key bottleneck
is related to long-tail distribution of rare properties. To solve this issue,
we evaluate several strategies: stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset
scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation. We show that the best
strategy to perform equally well over unbalanced target properties is to build
a training set where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given
threshold. To enable reproducibility, we publicly released our datasets,
experimental results and code. Our findings offer practical guidance for
training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future work in
semantic RE.

*Canhui Wu,Qiong Cao,Chao Xue,Wei Xi,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 3TF is a framework that trains models to internalize reasoning processes, enabling thought-free inference with concise outputs while maintaining high reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on compressing verbose reasoning outputs (Long-to-Short) but still require explicit reasoning during inference. 3TF takes a Short-to-Long approach to enable efficient reasoning without explicit step-by-step generation.

Method: Train a hybrid model that operates in both reasoning and non-reasoning modes, then further train on Chain-of-Thought data to internalize structured reasoning while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs during inference using the no-reasoning mode.

Result: 3TF-trained models achieve large improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference, demonstrating high quality reasoning can be learned and executed implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

Conclusion: The framework enables models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping external outputs short, improving reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs compared to compression-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have leveraged explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning accuracy. However, most
existing methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These
Long-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on
explicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \textbf{3TF}
(\textbf{T}hought-\textbf{T}raining and \textbf{T}hought-\textbf{F}ree
inference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long
perspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning
and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to
internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs
at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based
approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs,
enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping
external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large
improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference,
demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed
implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

*Longpeng Qiu,Ting Li,Shuai Mao,Nan Yang,Xiaohui Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QuestionRAG is a framework that improves LLM performance on question correction by using knowledge augmentation to prevent misinterpretation and RL-based alignment to avoid over-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with input errors in QA systems, often misinterpreting user intent or unnecessarily altering question structure, leading to incorrect responses.

Method: Uses external knowledge augmentation (search results, related entities) to address misinterpretation, and reinforcement learning to align model objectives with precise correction rather than paraphrasing.

Result: Knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding faulty questions, and RL-based alignment significantly outperforms traditional supervised fine-tuning, improving instruction following and generalization.

Conclusion: Integrating knowledge augmentation and RL-based alignment unlocks LLMs' full potential for question correction tasks.

Abstract: Input errors in question-answering (QA) systems often lead to incorrect
responses. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently
failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering
the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a
framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it
enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related
entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to
align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding
faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more
effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's
ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two
strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question
correction task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CareMedEval is a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal, derived from French medical exams with 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Current LLMs struggle with this task, failing to exceed 50% accuracy even with reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is essential in biomedicine, but LLMs have limited reliability for critical reasoning in specialized domains. Existing benchmarks don't adequately evaluate critical reading grounded in scientific papers.

Method: Created CareMedEval dataset from authentic French medical student exams containing 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Benchmarked state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions.

Result: Both open and commercial LLMs failed to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5. Generating intermediate reasoning tokens improved results but models still struggled, particularly with questions about study limitations and statistical analysis.

Conclusion: CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark that exposes current LLM limitations in grounded biomedical reasoning, paving the way for future development of automated support for critical appraisal.

Abstract: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the
biomedical field. While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising
support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for
critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an
original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and
reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students,
the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike
existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and
reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions
reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed
an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens
considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on
questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval
provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM
limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for
critical appraisal.

TL;DR: Kastor is a framework that enhances RDF pattern-based extraction for fine-tuning small language models, shifting from single SHACL shape validation to evaluating all property combinations to improve generalization and knowledge base refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet demands for completing and refining knowledge bases in specialized domains by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of small language models trained on limited text and RDF data.

Method: Reformulates validation from single SHACL shape to evaluating all possible property combinations, selects optimal combinations for training examples, and employs iterative learning to refine noisy knowledge bases.

Result: Significantly enhances model generalization and performance, enabling creation of robust models capable of uncovering new relevant facts.

Conclusion: Kastor advances RDF pattern-based extraction by improving model training and knowledge base refinement through comprehensive property combination evaluation and iterative learning.

Abstract: RDF pattern-based extraction is a compelling approach for fine-tuning small
language models (SLMs) by focusing a relation extraction task on a specified
SHACL shape. This technique enables the development of efficient models trained
on limited text and RDF data. In this article, we introduce Kastor, a framework
that advances this approach to meet the demands for completing and refining
knowledge bases in specialized domains. Kastor reformulates the traditional
validation task, shifting from single SHACL shape validation to evaluating all
possible combinations of properties derived from the shape. By selecting the
optimal combination for each training example, the framework significantly
enhances model generalization and performance. Additionally, Kastor employs an
iterative learning process to refine noisy knowledge bases, enabling the
creation of robust models capable of uncovering new, relevant facts

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BanglaSTEM dataset improves technical translation from Bangla to English, enabling better use of English LLMs for STEM problem solving in Bangla.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with technical terms, leading to mistranslations that change problem meanings and produce wrong answers when using English-focused language models.

Method: Created BanglaSTEM dataset with 5,000 high-quality Bangla-English STEM sentence pairs, trained T5-based translation model on this data, and tested on code generation and math problem solving tasks.

Result: Significant improvements in technical translation accuracy, making English-focused language models more effective for Bangla speakers.

Conclusion: BanglaSTEM dataset and trained translation model successfully address technical translation challenges, enabling better STEM problem solving in Bangla through English LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models work well for technical problem solving in English but
perform poorly when the same questions are asked in Bangla. A simple solution
would be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these
models. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with
technical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes
the meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a
dataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM
fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and
biology. We generated over 12,000 translations using language models and then
used human evaluators to select the highest quality pairs that preserve
technical terminology correctly. We train a T5-based translation model on
BanglaSTEM and test it on two tasks: generating code and solving math problems.
Our results show significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical
content, making it easier for Bangla speakers to use English-focused language
models effectively. Both the BanglaSTEM dataset and the trained translation
model are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/reyazul/BanglaSTEM-T5.

### [35] [HaluMem: Evaluating Hallucinations in Memory Systems of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03506)
*Ding Chen,Simin Niu,Kehang Li,Peng Liu,Xiangping Zheng,Bo Tang,Xinchi Li,Feiyu Xiong,Zhiyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HaluMem is the first operation-level hallucination evaluation benchmark for memory systems, introducing three evaluation tasks to identify where hallucinations occur during memory operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations in AI systems are primarily end-to-end question answering, making it difficult to localize where hallucinations arise within memory systems during storage and retrieval operations.

Method: Developed HaluMem benchmark with three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, memory question answering) using user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets (HaluMem-Medium and HaluMem-Long) containing 15k memory points and 3.5k questions across different context scales.

Result: Empirical studies show existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate hallucinations during extraction and updating stages, which then propagate errors to the question answering stage.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

Abstract: Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI
agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during
memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory
hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.
Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question
answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within
the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the
Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines
three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question
answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different
operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct
user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and
HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type
questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,
with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations
across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based
on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate
hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently
propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus
on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that
systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

TL;DR: Proposes EvolIF, an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following in LLMs through dynamic conversation benchmarks that track constraints, instructions, and topics, with GPT-5 showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to fixed turns, susceptible to saturation, and fail to account for interactive user experience in multi-topic dialogues.

Method: Three-layer framework decoupling linguistic forms from user intent, enabling dynamic benchmark construction with state changes and tracebacks, terminating when user patience is exhausted.

Result: GPT-5 sustains average 18.54 turns with 70.31% robustness, significantly outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by 11.41%, with other models lagging far behind.

Conclusion: The framework effectively evaluates multi-turn instruction-following, revealing significant performance differences among models, with GPT-5 demonstrating superior capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions
throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for
data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often
limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and
failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we
propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following
ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from
user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints,
instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by
enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and
tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated
user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the
interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving
instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types.
Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following
performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and
demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant
margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code
will be made publicly available online.

*Brian DuSell,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neural networks with stack augmentation can achieve human-like hierarchical generalization in language learning without special training conditions, outperforming standard architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human children naturally learn hierarchical syntactic rules without disambiguating examples, while standard neural networks require special conditions like syntactic supervision or massive pre-training to achieve similar generalization.

Method: Tested three base architectures (transformer, simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two stack types: superposition stack and a nondeterministic generalization. Also proposed a modification to stack RNN architecture.

Result: Transformers with nondeterministic stacks generalized best on question formation tasks. The modified stack RNN architecture showed improved hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: Stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language acquisition than standard architectures and serve as useful tools for psycholinguistic study.

Abstract: Any finite set of training data is consistent with an infinite number of
hypothetical algorithms that could have generated it. Studies have shown that
when human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on
hierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.
A recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network
architectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special
conditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,
or when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the
first time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in
human-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:
stack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,
simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack
of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed
by DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic
stacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question
formation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture
that improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that
stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language
acquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of
psycholinguistic study. Our code is publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop comprehensive benchmarks for measuring LLM logical reasoning abilities across multiple languages and difficulty levels, addressing the need for large, high-quality datasets.

Method: Generated zebra puzzles in multiple languages, themes, sizes (2x3 and 4x5), with 14 clue types and 8 red herring types. Created datasets of 128+1024 puzzles per language.

Result: Found 2x3 puzzles challenging for GPT-4o mini and 4x5 for o3-mini. 5 red herrings reduced o3-mini accuracy by 15±7%. No significant language/theme effects on performance. Published MultiZebraLogic datasets and generation code.

Conclusion: Successfully created adaptable multilingual reasoning benchmarks that can test LLMs of varying reasoning capabilities, with puzzle generation code designed for expansion to more languages and themes.

Abstract: Measuring the full abilities of large language models (LLMs) requires
benchmarks representing multiple tasks. We aim to create large, high-quality
datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages
and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability. We explore
multiple ways of increasing difficulty. We generate zebra puzzles in multiple
languages, themes, sizes and including 14 different clue types and 8 red
herring types (uninformative clues). We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are
sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a
reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini
puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5
puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the
common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no
correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of
128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic
languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation,
designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces controllable locality in transformer language models with a tunable parameter that enables continuous control between localist and distributed representations, achieving better interpretability while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between interpretability and performance in language models by creating a framework that allows dynamic control over representation localization without retraining.

Method: Used a two-layer transformer architecture on WikiText corpus with a tunable locality parameter λ ranging from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed), measuring attention entropy and pointer fidelity.

Result: Localist configurations (λ=1.0) achieved dramatically lower attention entropy (5.36 bits vs 7.18 bits) and higher pointer fidelity. Intermediate locality (λ=0.6) optimized trade-off with test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%.

Conclusion: Localist language models provide a practical framework for regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, offering mathematical control over the interpretability-performance spectrum.

Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable
locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that
enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization
through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models
that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows
dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and
efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We
conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer
architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across
the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our
results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower
attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18
bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer
fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets.
Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the
tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6
achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings
establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for
applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability,
offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance
spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design
principles.

Result: Created a tool that actively assists in interpreting regulations and drafting new ones aligned with current needs.

Conclusion: This approach significantly enhances legal research and regulation development effectiveness in the evolving legal field.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
better support policymakers in their crucial work of understanding, analyzing,

legal texts, we curated a supervised dataset tailored to the specific needs of
the legal domain. Additionally, we integrated the Retrieval-Augmented

legal knowledge from external sources. This combination of fine-tuning and
RAG-based augmentation results in a tool that not only processes legal
information but actively assists policymakers in interpreting regulations and
drafting new ones that align with current needs. The results demonstrate that
this approach can significantly enhance the effectiveness of legal research and
regulation development, offering a valuable resource in the ever-evolving field

### [44] [Towards Transparent Stance Detection: A Zero-Shot Approach Using Implicit and Explicit Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03635)
*Apoorva Upadhyaya,Wolfgang Nejdl,Marco Fisichella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS is a novel interpretable zero-shot stance detection framework that uses implicit rationales (text sequences) and explicit rationales (linguistic measures) to understand attitudes toward unseen targets, treating stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSSD methods suffer from generalizability issues, lack coherence between text and target, rely too much on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations, and lack interpretability in their reasoning processes.

Method: IRIS combines implicit rationales (text sequences relevant to different stances) and explicit rationales (linguistic measures capturing emotional and cognitive dimensions). It frames stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task without requiring ground-truth rationales.

Result: Extensive experiments on VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD datasets using 50%, 30%, and even 10% training data demonstrate strong generalizability and performance.

Conclusion: IRIS provides inherent interpretability through its dual rationale approach and information retrieval framework, enabling better understanding of stance predictions while maintaining strong performance with limited training data.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward
unseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data
augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between
text and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD
focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating
explanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by
their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that
lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it
difficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our
study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an
interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target
implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and
explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers
stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the
relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model
towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,
thus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales
based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive
dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's
attitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark
datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%
training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the
proposed architecture and interpretable design.

### [46] [Do Androids Dream of Unseen Puppeteers? Probing for a Conspiracy Mindset in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03699)
*Francesco Corso,Francesco Pierri,Gianmarco De Francisci Morales*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit partial conspiratorial tendencies, show sociodemographic biases in conspiracy beliefs, and can be easily manipulated into adopting conspiratorial perspectives through targeted prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs reproduce higher-order psychological constructs like conspiratorial mindset, as conspiracy beliefs play a central role in misinformation spread and institutional distrust, making them critical for assessing LLM social fidelity.

Method: Administer validated psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple LLM models under different prompting and conditioning strategies.

Result: LLMs show partial agreement with conspiracy beliefs, conditioning with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects revealing demographic biases, and targeted prompts can easily shift model responses toward conspiratorial directions.

Conclusion: LLMs' susceptibility to conspiratorial manipulation highlights the importance of critically evaluating their psychological dimensions for computational social science advancement and developing mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
conspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this
domain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial
perspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of
misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a
critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are
increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known
about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a
conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated
psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under
different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs
show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning
with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent
demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses
toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs
to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive
contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the
psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social
science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

*Nan Li,Albert Gatt,Massimo Poesio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a perspectivist annotation scheme for dialogue that captures speaker and addressee interpretations separately, revealing how misunderstandings emerge and repair in collaborative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how participants in asymmetric collaborative settings may believe they agree while actually referring to different entities, and to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over time.

Method: Developed a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline to obtain 13k annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates.

Result: Full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, showing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment.

Conclusion: The framework provides both a resource and analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and evaluating (V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue.

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing
common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while
referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme
for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures
speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,
enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over
time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k
annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the
resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings
are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies
systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask
referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an
analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating
(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative
dialogue.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth enable efficient, high-accuracy cropland mapping in Togo, supporting land use change assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate land cover maps to understand land use change as a climate change driver; geospatial embeddings offer efficient mapping but are underexplored in real-world applications.

Method: Used geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth to produce cropland maps in Togo.

Result: Geospatial embeddings simplified workflows and achieved high-accuracy cropland classification.

Conclusion: Geospatial embeddings can support better assessments of land use change and its climate impacts.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [49] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative hints is a training method that enforces known invariances across the entire input space using generative models to create virtual examples, outperforming standard data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation alone doesn't fully capture invariant properties since it only learns from transformations of training data, leaving gaps in learning spatial and other invariances across the entire input space.

Method: Leverage generative models trained on the dataset to create unlabeled virtual examples, then train models semi-supervised with both classification and hint objectives using these virtual examples to enforce functional properties.

Result: Consistently outperforms standard data augmentation across datasets, architectures, and loss functions. Achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement on fine-grained classification benchmarks and 1.286% average boost on CheXpert X-ray dataset.

Conclusion: Generative hints effectively enforce known invariances across the entire input space and provide superior performance compared to standard data augmentation methods.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E is a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for ecology that learns to infer missing modalities from context modalities, supports modality inversion, and enables cross-modal retrieval with mixed similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a multimodal representation model for ecology that can handle any-to-any generation of representations, learn what modalities to fuse for downstream tasks, and enable effective cross-modal retrieval.

Method: Based on masked modality reconstruction in embedding space, learning to infer missing modalities from context modalities. Uses probabilistic modeling to analyze modality fusion feasibility and proposes cross-modal retrieval with mixed inter-modal and intra-modal similarities.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance across all retrieval tasks and shows strong representation learning capability through linear probing tasks.

Conclusion: ProM3E provides an effective probabilistic approach for multimodal representation learning in ecology, enabling modality inversion, cross-modal retrieval, and analysis of modality fusion feasibility.

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvtSlowTV is a large-scale event camera dataset from YouTube footage with 13B+ events, enabling self-supervised depth estimation without frame annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based depth estimation methods are limited by small annotated datasets, restricting real-world generalization.

Method: Created EvtSlowTV dataset from YouTube footage with diverse scenarios, used for self-supervised learning framework that leverages raw event streams' HDR potential.

Result: Dataset is order of magnitude larger than existing ones; training with it improves generalization to complex scenes and motions.

Conclusion: EvtSlowTV enables robust event-based depth estimation in unconstrained settings while preserving event data's asynchronous nature.

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new hybrid CNN-ViT neural architecture search space for efficient tinyML image classification models that outperform ResNet-based approaches under tight size constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid CNN-ViT architectures are too large and computationally expensive for tinyML deployment, creating a need for efficient hybrid models that maintain performance while being suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Developed a novel NAS search space combining hybrid CNN and ViT blocks for local/global feature learning, plus searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction, tested on CIFAR10 dataset.

Result: The proposed search space successfully generated hybrid CNN-ViT architectures that achieved superior accuracy and inference speed compared to ResNet-based tinyML models while operating under strict model size limitations.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-ViT NAS approach enables creation of efficient models suitable for tinyML deployment, demonstrating that optimized hybrid architectures can outperform traditional CNN-only approaches in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP is a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework for volumetric medical data that integrates spatial and knowledge-infused semantics to achieve superior cross-task and cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models are limited to 2D data and binary supervision, overlooking continuous dependencies in volumetric data like CT scans and failing to preserve spatial coherence and clinical semantics.

Method: Proposes SCALE-VLP framework that combines volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical structure and domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (radiological ontologies) to guide alignment using soft-weighted contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Shows consistent gains in zero-shot evaluation on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP demonstrates strong cross-task transferability and cross-domain generalizability without fine-tuning, indicating its effectiveness in handling volumetric medical data with limited supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning enables effective 1-m land cover classification with only 1,000 annotated patches, achieving 87.14% accuracy for statewide mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of collecting large training datasets for high-resolution land cover mapping by developing a label-efficient approach using self-supervised learning.

Method: Used BYOL self-supervised pre-training on 377,921 unlabeled aerial images with ResNet-101, then fine-tuned multiple segmentation architectures (FCN, U-Net, etc.) with only 250-750 labeled patches.

Result: Achieved 87.14% overall accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score for 8-class land cover mapping over Mississippi, covering 123 billion pixels. Accurate for water/forest but challenging for cropland/herbaceous/barren distinctions.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning effectively reduces manual annotation requirements, enabling scalable high-resolution land cover mapping with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

TL;DR: A foundation model for brain MRI that handles different imaging sequence combinations using a single encoder with modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and masked autoencoding for missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that works with various MRI sequences without needing separate models for each modality, and to handle cases where some sequences are missing or unseen.

Method: Uses one encoder with learnable modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, masked autoencoding objective with variance-covariance regularizer. Trained on 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised reconstruction and modality imputation.

Result: Preliminary results show feasible performance. Planned evaluation on brain tumor and multiple sclerosis segmentation, and lesion classification under various modality settings.

Conclusion: The method enables flexible MRI analysis with missing modalities and provides a foundation model approach for brain imaging. Code and pretrained models are publicly available.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIP introduces structural contrastive learning to VLP by modeling relationships between entities in structured graphs, outperforming CLIP on cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLP methods treat image-text pairs as isolated examples, ignoring rich relational structures present in domains like e-commerce and social networks.

Method: Integrates structural contrastive loss to align modalities while modeling relationships between neighboring entities in structured graphs.

Result: Consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Relational supervision provides significant value for cross-modal alignment in vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds that predicts point-level uncertainty using geometric features, eliminating the need for ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground truth acquisition for uncertainty evaluation in MLS point clouds is costly and often infeasible in real-world applications, creating a need for GT-free evaluation methods.

Method: Integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction using machine learning models (XGBoost and Random Forest) to predict uncertainty quantified by C2C distance.

Result: XGBoost achieves comparable accuracy to Random Forest with 3x faster efficiency, demonstrating that geometric features can effectively predict point-level uncertainty.

Conclusion: MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, providing a novel learning-based approach for uncertainty evaluation without requiring ground truth data.

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computational imaging framework combining Compressive Sensing with Light-Sheet Microscopy for high-speed, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging using compressed acquisition and advanced denoising algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optical imaging struggles with the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture dynamic cellular structure in the rapidly beating heart on millisecond timescales.

Method: Uses compressed acquisition via random binary mask coding with DMD, and a Plug-and-Play framework solved with ADMM that incorporates advanced denoisers (Tikhonov, TV, BM3D) with temporal regularization for structural continuity.

Result: Experimental results on zebrafish heart imaging under high compression ratios successfully reconstruct cellular structures with excellent denoising performance and image clarity.

Conclusion: The method validates effectiveness and robustness in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios, overcoming limitations of traditional optical imaging for cardiac dynamics.

Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across
three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging
is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating
heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance
computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with
Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The
system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random
binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including
Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in
dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing
smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart
imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising
performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of
our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISC-Perception is the first hybrid dataset for Intermeshed Steel Connection component detection, combining synthetic CAD images, photorealistic game-engine scenes, and curated real photos to overcome data collection challenges in construction robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable dependable perception for ISC-aware robots in steel-frame assembly, addressing the lack of dedicated image datasets due to logistical difficulties, safety concerns, and privacy issues on active construction sites.

Method: Created a hybrid dataset blending procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and curated real photographs with fully automatic labeling of synthetic portions, explicitly accounting for all human effort in dataset generation.

Result: Achieved 81.7% reduction in human time (30.5h vs 166.7h for 10,000 images), detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved mAP@0.50 of 0.756, and on a 1,200-frame bench test achieved mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823.

Conclusion: ISC-Perception successfully bridges the data gap for construction-robotics perception, enabling rapid development of custom object detectors and is available for research and industrial use.

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative

### [60] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)
*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Sihao Li,Ji Jiang,Youpeng Yang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat is a 3D reconstruction framework for orthodontic telemedicine that handles sparse input images (typically 3 views) using 3D Gaussian Splatting with prior-guided initialization, scale-adaptive pruning, and optical flow constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthodontic telemedicine requires 3D reconstruction from sparse dental images (anterior and bilateral buccal views), but conventional 3DGS methods need dense multi-view inputs and precise camera poses, making them impractical for clinical scenarios.

Method: Uses prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction for point cloud initialization, scale-adaptive pruning for efficiency, and incorporates optical flow as geometric constraint with gradient regularization for sparse view scenarios.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases, achieving superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DentalSplat effectively handles sparse orthodontic imagery and enables high-quality 3D reconstruction for telemedicine applications, overcoming limitations of conventional 3DGS approaches.

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

### [61] [Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03120)
*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC DefectNCD is a support set free framework for IC defect detection and novel class discovery using image intrinsic priors in SEM images, achieving robust performance without extensive human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent and rare defects, while clustering-based unsupervised methods have unstable performance due to missing priors.

Method: Uses Self Normal Information Guided defect detection with learnable normal feature extractor, adaptive binarization for stable subimages, and Self Defect Information Guided classification with soft mask guided attention in teacher-student model.

Result: Validated on real-world dataset spanning three fabrication stages and 15 defect types, demonstrating robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles IC defect detection and novel class discovery without requiring support sets or extensive annotations, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \sysname accelerates vision-guided physical property reasoning from 10-20 minutes to under 6 seconds through geometric 3D reconstruction, semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable augmented visual cognition by minimizing latency in vision-guided physical property reasoning for real-time applications on smart glasses.

Method: Combines algorithmic and systematic optimizations including rapid geometric 3D reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.

Result: Achieves 62.9x-287.2x speedup while maintaining or slightly improving object-level physical property estimation accuracy, with superior performance in material segmentation and voxel-level inference compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: \sysname provides robust physical property estimations in real-world scenarios, demonstrated through successful deployment on Meta Aria Glasses in cluttered environments like IKEA stores.

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First operational AI/ML system for automated building damage assessment using sUAS imagery deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, processing 415 buildings in 18 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data avalanche problem where sUAS teams collect 47GB-369GB of imagery per day during disasters, overwhelming human analysis capabilities and delaying response efforts.

Method: Developed models trained on largest known post-disaster sUAS dataset (21,716 building damage labels) and operationally trained 91 disaster practitioners. Deployed best performing model during actual hurricane responses.

Result: Successfully deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, assessing 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes, establishing the first operational state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment.

Conclusion: This work contributes the first documented operational use of AI/ML for damage assessment during disasters and provides lessons learned for both AI/ML research and user communities.

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

*Sagar Shrestha,Gopal Sharma,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuning-free personalization method for text-to-image diffusion models using hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images, eliminating per-subject optimization while maintaining subject fidelity and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subject-specific fine-tuning approaches like DreamBooth are computationally expensive and slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods still require additional fine-tuning or large backbone models for satisfactory results.

Method: Uses hypernetworks to predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images with end-to-end training objective stabilized by output regularization. Introduces Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG) to combine base model's compositional strengths with personalized model's subject fidelity.

Result: Achieves strong personalization performance on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench datasets, demonstrating reliable and effective hypernetworks without per-subject optimization.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

*Yun-Chen Lin,Jiayuan Huang,Hanyuan Zhang,Sergi Kavtaradze,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-guided liver landmark segmentation framework using SAM2 and Depth Anything V2 encoders with SRFT-GaLore fine-tuning method achieves improved segmentation accuracy and cross-dataset generalization in laparoscopic surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate anatomical structure detection in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging due to 2D video limitations and depth perception issues, requiring better fusion of RGB and depth features and efficient adaptation of large vision models.

Method: Proposes dual-encoder framework with SAM2 for RGB features and Depth Anything V2 for depth features, integrated via cross-attention fusion. Introduces SRFT-GaLore for efficient fine-tuning using Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform instead of SVD.

Result: Achieves 4.85% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient and 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface Distance on L3D dataset. Maintains competitive performance on new LLSD dataset, demonstrating strong cross-dataset robustness.

Conclusion: The SRFT-GaLore-enhanced dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under real-time surgical settings with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PitVQA-Anticipation is the first VQA dataset for surgical anticipation, and SurgAnt-ViVQA is a video-language model that uses temporal modeling and gated cross-attention to predict future surgical events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VQA systems focus on current scenes rather than anticipating future events, which is crucial for real-time assistance in endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery where visibility is limited and workflow changes rapidly.

Method: Proposed SurgAnt-ViVQA model adapts a large language model using GRU Gated Temporal Cross-Attention module, with bidirectional GRU for frame dynamics and adaptive gate for visual context injection. Uses parameter efficient fine-tuning for surgical domain customization.

Result: SurgAnt-ViVQA outperforms strong image and video baselines on PitVQA-Anticipation and EndoVis datasets. Temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most performance gains. Frame budget study shows 8 frames maximize fluency while 32 frames improve time estimation.

Conclusion: The model advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation, highlighting the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable future-aware surgical assistance.

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes QG-CoC, a zero-shot prompting method that improves MLLMs' fine-grained perception and reasoning across multiple images by using question-guided chain-of-captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack fine-grained perception across disparate images and struggle to reason over multiple visual inputs, with existing methods primarily focusing on single-image scenarios.

Method: QG-CoC (Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions) - a generalized zero-shot prompting approach that handles arbitrary numbers of images by guiding caption generation with questions.

Result: Competitive performance across multi-image and single-image benchmarks, with robust improvements in challenging scenarios where existing methods fail.

Conclusion: QG-CoC effectively addresses the limitations of current prompting methods in multi-image contexts, demonstrating superior perception and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

TL;DR: Proposes MvBody, a multi-view Transformer network using 3D body scans and self-reported medical data for cesarean section risk prediction, achieving 84.62% accuracy with interpretable feature importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for early CS risk assessment in resource-limited settings where traditional hospital-based models are unavailable, requiring affordable general devices.

Method: MvBody network with multi-view Transformer architecture using 3D optical body scans (31st-38th weeks) and self-reported medical data, enhanced with metric learning loss for data-scarce environments.

Result: Superior performance with 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC on test set, outperforming existing ML models and 3D analysis methods.

Conclusion: 3D body shape analysis combined with medical data enables effective CS risk prediction, with key features including pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS, and head/shoulder body shape.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MCPMix and RLA for endoscopic segmentation: uses diffusion-generated synthetic images with real masks for paired mixing, maintaining mask consistency while increasing appearance diversity, with adaptive re-anchoring to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing augmentation methods: sample mixing causes soft label ambiguity from misaligned masks, while diffusion synthesis overlooks mask conditioning benefits and introduces domain shift.

Method: 1) Generate synthetic image counterparts using diffusion under same masks as real images; 2) MCPMix: mix only image appearance while keeping original hard masks; 3) RLA: adaptively adjust mixing strength and loss weights to gradually re-anchor to real data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017 datasets, with consistent gains over baselines.

Conclusion: Combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity and adaptive re-anchoring yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

TL;DR: T-PMambaSR is a lightweight super-resolution framework that combines window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable fine-grained multi-scale modeling with linear complexity, plus an adaptive high-frequency refinement module for detail recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based SR methods lack fine-grained transitions across different modeling scales, limiting feature representation efficiency, despite their advantage in global receptive fields with linear complexity over Transformer-based approaches.

Method: Integrates window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable interactions among receptive fields of different scales, establishing a fine-grained modeling paradigm. Also introduces an Adaptive High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover lost high-frequency details.

Result: Extensive experiments show T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and expressiveness, achieving better performance than recent Transformer- or Mamba-based methods with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed T-PMambaSR framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing Mamba-based SR methods by enabling fine-grained multi-scale modeling while maintaining linear complexity, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

Motivation: To address the challenge of early stages providing both low-level fundamental features to deep stages and high-level discriminative features to early-stage predictors simultaneously in inference-efficient models.

Method: Introduces lightweight bypass module for functional decomposition, high-order statistics-based predictor for early stages, and two-phase decoupled optimization with weighted losses for multi-stage predictors.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and pre-trained backbones show DMPO clearly outperforms counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively decouples representative and discriminative abilities in early stages through both architecture design and model optimization, achieving better inference efficiency.

tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

*Nikolina Tomic Roshni Bhatnagar,Sarthak Jain,Connor Lau,Tien-Yu Liu,Laura Gambini,Rima Arnaout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative method for translating between ultrasound color flow doppler and greyscale videos that produces realistic synthetic data indistinguishable from real videos in clinical evaluation and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data imbalance and missingness in ultrasound studies where different sub-modalities like greyscale and color flow doppler are often imbalanced, limiting deep learning applications in medical imaging.

Method: Used pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual losses with two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and another for denoising to achieve realistic ultrasound imaging, trained on 54,975 videos.

Result: Synthetic videos achieved SSIM of 0.91±0.04 with ground truth, performed indistinguishably from real videos in classification (F1: 0.9 real vs 0.89 synthetic) and segmentation (Dice: 0.97), with clinicians only 54±6% accurate at distinguishing real vs synthetic.

Conclusion: The method successfully generates realistic synthetic ultrasound videos that expand utility of retrospective imaging data and augment dataset design for medical imaging, demonstrating foundational capabilities across clinical domains despite being trained only on heart videos.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models like U-Net variants struggle with efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning under practical computational constraints.

Method: Hybrid architecture using U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation, combining Mamba-based state-space modules for long-range reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators in bottleneck layers to simulate frequency-domain thermal diffusion.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Blending state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion provides a scalable and interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning
architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to
achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning
under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose
a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation.
Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range
reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers,
simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic
abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending
state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

*Bingyang Guo,Hongjie Li,Ruiyun Yu,Hanzhe Liang,Jinbao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IEC3D-AD, a high-fidelity industrial equipment component anomaly detection dataset, and proposes GMANet, a novel 3D anomaly detection method using geometric morphological analysis and spatial discrepancy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D anomaly detection datasets lack the complexity and subtle defects found in real industrial environments, limiting precise anomaly detection research for industrial equipment components like bearings, rings, and bolts.

Method: Developed IEC3D-AD dataset collected from actual production lines, and proposed GMANet - a 3D-AD paradigm that generates synthetic point cloud samples via geometric morphological analysis and optimizes spatial discrepancy to reduce margin between normal and abnormal features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets, with improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity.

Conclusion: The IEC3D-AD dataset and GMANet method address limitations of existing 3D-AD approaches by providing more realistic industrial data and an effective detection paradigm for industrial equipment components.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting using text-to-video diffusion models with LoRA fine-tuning and temporal co-denoising to generate arbitrarily long videos without seams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of generating long videos and achieving high controllability in video inpainting and outpainting tasks simultaneously.

Method: Extends text-to-video diffusion models using LoRA for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models, employs overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising strategy with high-order solvers for consistency across long sequences.

Result: Enables arbitrarily long video generation and editing without noticeable seams or drift, outperforms baseline methods (Wan 2.1, VACE) in quality metrics (PSNR/SSIM) and perceptual realism (LPIPS).

Conclusion: Achieves practical long-range video editing with minimal overhead, balancing parameter efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Tianyu Cui,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-SDPO introduces a safeguarded update rule for diffusion-based DPO that prevents degradation of preferred outputs by adaptively scaling loser gradients, improving alignment with human preferences in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Diffusion-DPO has a pathology where enlarging preference margins can increase reconstruction errors for both winner and loser branches, degrading generation quality despite preference learning.

Method: Proposes Diffusion-SDPO with safeguarded update rule that preserves winner quality by adaptively scaling loser gradient based on its alignment with winner gradient, using closed-form scaling coefficient from first-order analysis.

Result: Outperforms preference-learning baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics across standard text-to-image benchmarks with only marginal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO is a simple, model-agnostic solution that effectively addresses DPO pathology in diffusion models, delivering consistent improvements in human preference alignment for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

TL;DR: SurgViVQA is a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes using temporal cues, outperforming existing methods on colonoscopic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VideoQA approaches are limited to static image features and lack temporal annotations, ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation.

Method: Uses a Masked Video-Text Encoder to fuse video and question features capturing temporal cues, with a fine-tuned LLM to decode answers. Also introduces REAL-Colon-VQA dataset with motion-related questions.

Result: Outperforms existing image-based VQA models, improving over PitVQA by +11% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9% on EndoVis18-VQA. Shows improved robustness to question phrasing variations.

Conclusion: SurgViVQA provides a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAVGen is a unified framework for joint audio-video generation that addresses lip synchronization and semantic consistency issues through dual-branch diffusion transformers with cross-modal interaction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source audio-video generation methods suffer from poor lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency due to ineffective cross-modal modeling.

Method: Uses dual-branch Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism for bidirectional cross-attention, Face-Aware Modulation for prioritizing salient regions, and Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance for enhanced cross-modal correlation.

Result: With only 1.3M training samples (vs 30.1M in other methods), UniAVGen achieves superior performance in audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency.

Conclusion: UniAVGen provides a robust joint synthesis framework that unifies multiple audio-video tasks in a single model while delivering better cross-modal consistency with significantly fewer training samples.

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAPL introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantics, improving prompt learning for zero-shot learning tasks across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods like CoOp and CoCoOp struggle with generalization to unseen categories and lack explicit guidance for learning semantically meaningful visual features, while image-based augmentation potential remains unexplored.

Method: AAPL uses adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantic representations, enabling prompts to focus on visually discriminative features aligned with target categories.

Result: AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across 11 benchmark datasets in few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

Conclusion: Image-level augmentations with attribute-specific variations can significantly enhance prompt learning, and AAPL's adversarial approach effectively improves generalization by focusing on semantically meaningful visual features.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: Automated method for standardizing embryo alignment in 3D ultrasound images using PCA and multiple selection strategies, achieving high accuracy for prenatal growth monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized alignment facilitates standard plane detection, improves landmark visualization, and accentuates differences between scans for better prenatal growth monitoring.

Method: Apply PCA to embryo segmentation mask to extract principal axes, generate four candidate orientations, then select standard orientation using Pearson correlation heuristic, atlas-based image matching, or Random Forest classifier.

Result: PCA correctly extracted principal axes in 99.0% of 2166 images. Selection accuracy: Pearson Heuristic 97.4%, Atlas-based 95.8%, Random Forest 98.4%. Majority Vote achieved 98.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: High-accuracy pipeline enables consistent embryonic alignment in first trimester, supporting scalable analysis in clinical and research settings. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends Shape-from-Template (SfT) to handle topological changes like tears and cuts by iteratively adapting the template through domain partitioning to minimize an energy functional combining physical plausibility and reprojection consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SfT methods fail when objects undergo topological changes during deformation, limiting their practical applicability for real-world scenarios involving tears, cuts, or other structural modifications.

Method: Initialize with classical SfT solution, then iteratively partition the template's spatial domain to minimize an energy functional that jointly considers physical plausibility and reprojection consistency.

Result: Method robustly captures various topological events on bounded 2D surfaces, outperforming baseline methods on both synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: Establishes the first general framework for topological-change-aware SfT, enabling reconstruction of deformable objects even when topological changes occur.

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: Anny is a scan-free, differentiable human body model based on anthropometric knowledge that provides interpretable shape control across diverse demographics and supports various 3D human modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric body models rely on costly 3D scans and proprietary shape spaces that are demographically narrow, limiting accessibility and diversity in human-centric tasks.

Method: Anny defines a continuous, interpretable shape space using anthropometric knowledge from MakeHuman, controlled by phenotype parameters (gender, age, height, weight) calibrated with WHO population statistics.

Result: Anny enables millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled synthetic data generation, and HMR training. Anny-One dataset of 800k photorealistic humans shows HMR models trained with Anny match scan-based model performance while being interpretable and representative.

Conclusion: Anny provides an accessible, open-source foundation for human-centric 3D modeling with realistic demographic variation, released under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for
human-centric 3D modeling.

*Vittal L. Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation that scales coordinate channels by local signal intensity, improving localization tasks in biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization tasks in biomedical data require learning spatial/temporal relationships from signals with complex intensity distributions. Current methods like CoordConv use pure coordinate channels, but these don't capture intensity-position relationships.

Method: Replace pure coordinate channels with channels scaled by local signal intensity, creating an intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation. This provides a modality-agnostic inductive bias.

Result: Evaluated on ECG signal transition timing prediction and nuclear center coordinate regression. The proposed method showed faster convergence and higher generalization performance compared to conventional coordinate-channel approaches.

Conclusion: The signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation is effective across both 1D and 2D biomedical signals, providing better performance than traditional coordinate-based methods.

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

TL;DR: Lightweight 3DCNN for privacy-preserving human activity recognition using event cameras, achieving 94.17% accuracy with compact design for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in human monitoring by using event cameras that only capture pixel intensity changes instead of identifiable personal information like conventional cameras.

Method: Proposed lightweight 3DCNN with focal loss and class reweighting for class imbalance, plus targeted data augmentation. Trained on composite dataset from Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.9415 and overall accuracy of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures (C3D, ResNet3D, MC3_18) by up to 3%.

Conclusion: Event-based deep learning enables accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human action recognition suitable for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human
action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

### [87] [Part-Aware Bottom-Up Group Reasoning for Fine-Grained Social Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03666)
*Dongkeun Kim,Minsu Cho,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A part-aware bottom-up framework for fine-grained social interaction detection that uses body part features and interpersonal relations to infer social groups, outperforming prior methods on the NVI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook subtle social cues like facial expressions and gestures, relying instead on holistic representations and directly detecting groups without modeling underlying interactions, which limits their ability to capture localized social signals.

Method: Detects individuals and enhances features using part-aware cues, then infers group configuration through similarity-based reasoning that considers both spatial relations and subtle social cues signaling interactions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NVI dataset, demonstrating superior group inference accuracy compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed part-aware bottom-up framework effectively captures fine-grained social interactions by modeling interpersonal relations through body part features, leading to more accurate social group detection.

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

*Jongseo Lee,Wooil Lee,Gyeong-Moon Park,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCE is a video action recognition framework that disentangles motion dynamics from spatial context using concept-based explanations, improving interpretability while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video explanation methods produce entangled explanations that don't clearly separate motion from spatial context, and language-based approaches struggle to explain tacit motions that are hard to verbalize.

Method: Uses disentangled concept types: motion dynamics (human pose sequences), objects, and scenes. Employs large language models to extract object/scene concepts automatically and uses ante-hoc concept bottleneck design to enforce prediction through these concepts.

Result: Demonstrated on four datasets (KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, UCF-101) with significantly improved explanation clarity and competitive performance. User study validated superior interpretability, and framework proved beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

Conclusion: DANCE successfully addresses the disentanglement challenge in video action recognition explanations, providing clearer insights into model predictions while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

### [89] [Seeing What You Say: Expressive Image Generation from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03423)
*Jiyoung Lee,Song Park,Sanghyuk Chun,Soo-Whan Chung*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: VoxStudio is the first end-to-end speech-to-image model that generates expressive images directly from speech, using a speech information bottleneck to preserve prosody and emotion without needing speech-to-text conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-to-image systems rely on speech-to-text conversion which loses important paralinguistic information like tone and emotion, limiting their ability to generate expressive images.

Method: Uses a speech information bottleneck (SIB) module to compress raw speech into compact semantic tokens that preserve prosody and emotional nuance, enabling direct speech-to-image generation without intermediate text conversion.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on SpokenCOCO, Flickr8kAudio, and VoxEmoset benchmarks demonstrate the method's feasibility and highlight challenges like emotional consistency and linguistic ambiguity.

Conclusion: VoxStudio paves the way for future research in speech-to-image generation by addressing key challenges and introducing a unified end-to-end approach that preserves emotional and prosodic information.

Abstract: This paper proposes VoxStudio, the first unified and end-to-end
speech-to-image model that generates expressive images directly from spoken
descriptions by jointly aligning linguistic and paralinguistic information. At
its core is a speech information bottleneck (SIB) module, which compresses raw
speech into compact semantic tokens, preserving prosody and emotional nuance.
By operating directly on these tokens, VoxStudio eliminates the need for an
additional speech-to-text system, which often ignores the hidden details beyond
text, e.g., tone or emotion. We also release VoxEmoset, a large-scale paired
emotional speech-image dataset built via an advanced TTS engine to affordably
generate richly expressive utterances. Comprehensive experiments on the
SpokenCOCO, Flickr8kAudio, and VoxEmoset benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility
of our method and highlight key challenges, including emotional consistency and
linguistic ambiguity, paving the way for future research.

### [90] [From Measurement to Expertise: Empathetic Expert Adapters for Context-Based Empathy in Conversational AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03143)
*Erfan Shayegani,Jina Suh,Andy Wilson,Nagu Rangan,Javier Hernandez*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A framework for developing context-specific empathetic LLMs that reduces the empathy gap between user expectations and AI responses by 72.66% using specialized expert adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI models display generic empathy rather than context-specific empathy tailored to different tasks and situations, creating a gap between expected and experienced empathy.

Method: Analyzed real-world conversations across 8 tasks, developed synthetic multi-turn conversation generation pipeline, and trained empathetic expert adapters that specialize in varying empathy levels based on recognized task context.

Result: Achieved 72.66% reduction in empathy gap between perceived and desired empathy, with empathy scores increasing by average factor of 2.43. Expert adapters outperformed system prompts in preserving empathy patterns throughout longer conversations.

Conclusion: Context-specific empathetic expert adapters are more effective than generic approaches at maintaining appropriate empathy levels across different conversational tasks and throughout multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Empathy is a critical factor in fostering positive user experiences in
conversational AI. While models can display empathy, it is often generic rather
than tailored to specific tasks and contexts. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for developing and evaluating context-specific empathetic large
language models (LLMs). We first analyze a real-world conversational dataset
consisting of 672 multi-turn conversations across 8 tasks, revealing
significant differences in terms of expected and experienced empathy before and
after the conversations, respectively. To help minimize this gap, we develop a
synthetic multi-turn conversational generation pipeline and steer responses
toward our defined empathy patterns based on the context that more closely
matches users' expectations. We then train empathetic expert adapters for
context-specific empathy that specialize in varying empathy levels based on the
recognized task. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant gap reduction
of 72.66% between perceived and desired empathy with scores increasing by an
average factor of 2.43 as measured by our metrics and reward models.
Additionally, our trained empathetic expert adapters demonstrate superior
effectiveness in preserving empathy patterns throughout conversation turns,
outperforming system prompts, which tend to dramatically diminish in impact as
conversations lengthen.

*Yangliu Fan,Kilian Buehling,Volker Stocker*

TL;DR: This study measures social science knowledge diffusion from research to journalism and policy domains using text analysis of 72,703 documents, finding varying diffusion patterns and semantic shifts across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of measuring social science knowledge diffusion beyond direct references and understand how research ideas spread across different domains like journalism and policy-making.

Method: Used text-based approach with 72,703 documents (2000-2019) from research, journalism, and policy domains; counted idea mentions, estimated domain-specific contexts using embedding regression, and tracked differences across domains and time.

Result: Diffusion patterns vary significantly between ideas; semantic distances between research and policy are larger than between research and journalism; ideas shift roles across domains (theory → sense-making → applied use); semantic convergence occurs mainly for practically oriented ideas over time.

Conclusion: The study successfully characterizes cross-domain diffusion patterns of social science knowledge at the idea level, demonstrating the value of text-based approaches for measuring knowledge diffusion beyond traditional citation analysis.

Abstract: Despite the importance of social science knowledge for various stakeholders,
measuring its diffusion into different domains remains a challenge. This study
uses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social
science knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making
domains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the
measurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories
as key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703
documents (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and
policy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas
in each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare
differences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion
patterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas
diffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding
regression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find
that the distances between research and policy are typically larger than
between research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles
across domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making
in news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe
semantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our
results characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social
science knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for
measuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using Llama 3.1-405B LLM to automatically generate structured data use case labels for genomic dataset citations in scientific literature, achieving F1 score of .674 in zero-shot classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale the description of data use cases in scientific literature automatically, avoiding expensive manual labeling and training dataset development for traditional ML systems.

Method: Applied open-source LLM (Llama 3.1-405B) to generate structured data use case labels for publications using genomic datasets, with a novel evaluation framework for assessing method efficacy.

Result: The stock model achieved F1 score of .674 on zero-shot data citation classification without predefined categories, showing promising performance but with limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for automating data use case labeling, but challenges remain including data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure requirements, and evaluation costs.

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between
specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing
that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to
explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with
pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential
means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published
literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of
training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we
apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case
labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also
introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our
methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score
of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously
defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers
related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,
and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

### [93] [The Curved Spacetime of Transformer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03060)
*Riccardo Di Sipio,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Luis Serrano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a geometric framework that analogizes Transformer language models to General Relativity, treating attention as a discrete connection that transports value vectors through a curved representation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a geometric understanding of Transformer-based language models by drawing explicit analogies to concepts from General Relativity, particularly focusing on how attention mechanisms create curvature in representation space.

Method: The authors design experiments to test their geometric framework: (i) visualizing curvature landscapes across tokens and layers, (ii) analyzing turning angles and length-to-chord ratios through simulations, and (iii) probing deflection under controlled context edits inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment.

Result: Experimental results confirm the presence of attention-induced curvature: local turning angles vary across tokens and layers, excess counts of sharp/flat angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality or chance, and context edits cause measurable, meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories.

Conclusion: The geometric analogy to General Relativity holds - token embeddings do not traverse straight paths but instead bend and reorient due to attention-induced curvature in the representation space, providing a novel framework for understanding Transformer dynamics.

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language
models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys
induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a
discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across
tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token
representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the
role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in
parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not
traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps
should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.
To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence
and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a
full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and
layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat
angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality
or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe
deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,
meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm
attention-induced curvature.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two LLM-driven frameworks for generating adaptive adversarial examples to assess LLM robustness against subtle, natural-looking attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong zero-shot performance, their robustness against adversarial inputs in sensitive tasks needs systematic assessment to ensure reliability and security.

Method: Developed automated LLM-driven pipeline using StaDec and DyDec frameworks to generate semantically similar but deceptive adversarial examples without external heuristics.

Result: The attacks produce subtle, natural-looking adversarial inputs that effectively deceive target LLMs and demonstrate strong transferability across unknown models.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic approach for self-assessment of LLM robustness, with evolving attacks that adapt to LLM advancements.

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a
simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However,
when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly
assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce
Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack
frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial
examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and
natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the
original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an
automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external
heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate
strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this
work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's
robustness. We release our code and data at

TL;DR: Vision Transformer (ViT) applied to options data can predict 30-day realized volatility from implied volatility surfaces, showing ability to learn seasonal patterns and nonlinear features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have shown promise in financial forecasting but remain unexplored for options data. Deep learning's complexity advantage in learning nonlinear relationships motivates applying transformer architectures to options volatility prediction.

Method: Used Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically for image recognition, to predict 30-day realized volatility from implied volatility surfaces augmented with date information.

Result: ViT successfully learned seasonal patterns and nonlinear features from the implied volatility surface, demonstrating promising performance for options data modeling.

Conclusion: Transformer models, particularly ViT, show potential for options data analysis and represent a promising direction for future model development in financial machine learning.

Abstract: Recent work in financial machine learning has shown the virtue of complexity:
the phenomenon by which deep learning methods capable of learning highly
nonlinear relationships outperform simpler approaches in financial forecasting.
While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial
time series forecasting, the application of transformer models for options data
remains largely unexplored. We conduct preliminary studies towards the
development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and
classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the
next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date
information) for a single day. We show that the ViT can learn seasonal patterns
and nonlinear features from the IV surface, suggesting a promising direction
for model development.

TL;DR: AQR is a test-time adaptation method that recalibrates pre-activation distributions using quantile alignment, enabling unsupervised domain adaptation without model retraining across various normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are limited to specific normalization layers, making them impractical for dynamic real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Quantile Recalibration (AQR) that aligns quantiles on a channel-wise basis for pre-activation distributions, with robust tail calibration to handle varying batch sizes.

Result: AQR outperforms existing test-time adaptation baselines on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures, demonstrating robust adaptation across diverse settings.

Conclusion: AQR shows strong potential for real-world deployment in dynamic environments with unpredictable data distributions, offering a practical solution for domain adaptation without retraining.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a key strategy for enhancing the generalizability of
deep learning models in real-world scenarios, where test distributions often
diverge significantly from the training domain. However, conventional
approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require
model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or
resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on
batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but
they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained
to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration
(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation
distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the
full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures
employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of
estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a
robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our
method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling
unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,
CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR
achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing
test-time adaptation baselines. These results highlight AQR's potential for
deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data
distributions.

TL;DR: The paper adapts the probabilistic U-Net for statistical downscaling of climate model outputs, evaluating four training objectives to bridge the gap between coarse climate model outputs and fine-scale requirements for impact studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate models produce outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, but climate change impact studies require finer scales. Statistical downscaling is needed to bridge this resolution gap.

Method: Adapted probabilistic U-Net with deterministic U-Net backbone and variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. Evaluated four training objectives: afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for downscaling precipitation and temperature from 16x coarser resolution.

Result: WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain settings, while afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

Conclusion: Different training objectives have complementary strengths - WMSE-MS-SSIM is better for extremes and afCRPS for spatial variability, suggesting the need for careful objective selection based on application requirements.

Abstract: Climate models are limited by heavy computational costs, often producing
outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, while many climate change impact studies
require finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this gap, and we adapt
the probabilistic U-Net for this task, combining a deterministic U-Net backbone
with a variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. We evaluate
four training objectives, afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for
downscaling precipitation and temperature from $16\times$ coarser resolution.
Our main finding is that WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain
settings, whereas afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

TL;DR: FCDC is a closed-loop control paradigm for data collection that uses online probabilistic modeling and feedback signals to dynamically regulate sample retention, balancing exploration/exploitation and preventing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are constrained by data quality and diversity rather than model capacity, and most datasets are collected in open-loop manner without feedback, leading to inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization.

Method: Formulates data collection as closed-loop control problem using online probabilistic model to approximate collected data distribution state, with adaptive sample retention based on feedback signals like likelihood and Mahalanobis distance.

Result: On real data streams, FCDC produces 25.9% more balanced datasets while reducing data storage by 39.8%, demonstrating controllability on synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Data collection can be actively controlled, transforming it from a passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the core of data-centric AI.

Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by
the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on
data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which
accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This
results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To
address this, this paper introduces \ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data
collection as a closed-loop control problem. \ac{FCDC} continuously
approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online
probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on
feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this
feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and
exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from
accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \ac{FCDC} on
a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \ac{FCDC}
produces more balanced datasets by $\SI{25.9}{\percent}$ while reducing data
storage by $\SI{39.8}{\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data
collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a
passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the
core of data-centric AI.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of classical Entropy Minimization (EM) and proposes AdaDEM, which decouples EM into cluster aggregation and gradient mitigation components to address reward collapse and easy-class bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the internal mechanism of Entropy Minimization and address its limitations in reducing class overlap and bridging domain gaps, particularly the coupled formulation problems of reward collapse and easy-class bias.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM) that normalizes the cluster aggregation driving factor reward and replaces gradient mitigation calibrator with marginal entropy calibrator.

Result: AdaDEM outperforms DEM* (an upper-bound variant of classical EM) and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Decoupling Entropy Minimization into separate components with proper calibration effectively addresses the limitations of classical EM and improves performance in challenging learning scenarios.

Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging
domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,
yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we
reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:
cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts
a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)
penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.
Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled
formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty
samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment
between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we
propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the
reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to
replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,
and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised
learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

*Haotian Yin,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Scheduling strategies for Off-Diagonal Weingarten loss in neural SDFs improve CAD reconstruction by dynamically adjusting regularization strength during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed ODW weights in FlatCAD are suboptimal - strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail recovery in later stages.

Method: Proposed time-varying schedules for ODW loss with constant, linear, quintic, step interpolation, and increasing warm-up variants that decay regularization strength over training.

Result: Time-varying schedules consistently outperform fixed weights, achieving up to 35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over FlatCAD baseline on ABC CAD dataset.

Conclusion: Scheduling is a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for robust CAD reconstruction.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation
for geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both
gradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and
preserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten
(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating
full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,
FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:
strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail
recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss
that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively
decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear,
quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up
variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying
schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a

### [101] [LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03628)
*Haofei Yu,Fenghai Li,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: LiveTradeBench is a live trading environment that evaluates LLM agents in realistic markets with real-time data streaming, portfolio management, and multi-market testing, revealing gaps between static benchmarks and real-world decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks occur in static settings without real dynamics and uncertainty, failing to evaluate decision-making under uncertainty in evolving environments.

Method: Created LiveTradeBench with three design principles: live data streaming of market prices and news, portfolio-management abstraction for multi-asset allocation, and multi-market evaluation across U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets.

Result: 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs showed that high LMArena scores don't guarantee superior trading outcomes, models exhibit distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite, and some LLMs effectively adapt to live signals.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across
benchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but
these tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.
Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than
decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce
LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in
realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:
(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on
offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing
real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends
control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk
management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across
structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction
markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each
step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs
percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we
run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)
high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display
distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and
(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These
findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,
motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency
under live uncertainty.

### [102] [Comprehensive Assessment of LiDAR Evaluation Metrics: A Comparative Study Using Simulated and Real Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02994)
*Syed Mostaquim Ali,Taufiq Rahman,Ghazal Farhani,Mohamed H. Zaki,Benoit Anctil,Dominique Charlebois*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores evaluation metrics for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans in autonomous driving virtual testing environments, finding Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) to be the most effective metric across various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive physical testing of Autonomous Driving Systems is impractical due to cost and safety concerns, so Virtual Testing Environments (VTEs) are needed as alternatives. Comparing VTE-generated sensor outputs with real-world data can validate VTE accuracy.

Method: The research used a comprehensive experimental approach to evaluate metrics for comparing real and simulated LiDAR scans, testing sensitivity and accuracy with different noise, density, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. A VTE was generated using real LiDAR scan data collected in a controlled environment with static objects.

Result: Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) performed best across all test cases. Simulated and real LiDAR scans showed similar semantic segmentation output (mIoU of 21% with corrected intensity) and average DCD of 0.63, indicating slight geometric differences but significant model output differences. DCD was most correlated with perception methods.

Conclusion: Density Aware Chamfer Distance is the most suitable metric for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans in virtual testing environments for autonomous driving systems, showing strong correlation with perception methods and consistent performance across various conditions.

Abstract: For developing safe Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), rigorous testing is
required before they are deemed safe for road deployments. Since comprehensive
conventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,
Virtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing
VTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong
indication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this
work explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation
metrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The
metrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,
density, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing
the metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best
across all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing
Environment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in
a controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle
equipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from
the VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans
were compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and
simulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU
of 21\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance
(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties
of simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model
outputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be
the most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.

### [103] [OneOcc: Semantic Occupancy Prediction for Legged Robots with a Single Panoramic Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03571)
*Hao Shi,Ze Wang,Shangwei Guo,Mengfei Duan,Song Wang,Teng Chen,Kailun Yang,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OneOcc is a vision-only panoramic semantic scene completion framework for legged/humanoid robots that addresses gait-induced body jitter and 360° continuity through dual-projection fusion, bi-grid voxelization, hierarchical decoding, and gait displacement compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most semantic scene completion systems target wheeled platforms with forward-facing sensors, but legged/humanoid robots need robust 3D semantic occupancy that can handle gait-introduced body jitter and provide 360° continuous perception.

Method: Combines four key components: (1) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) using annular panorama and equirectangular unfolding; (2) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces; (3) lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for multi-scale fusion; (4) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) for feature-level motion correction.

Result: Sets new SOTA on two panoramic occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped) and Human360Occ (H3O). On QuadOcc, beats vision baselines and popular LiDAR methods. On H3O, gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city). Modules are lightweight and deployable.

Conclusion: OneOcc enables robust full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots through panoramic semantic scene completion, addressing key challenges of gait-induced jitter and 360° continuity with lightweight, deployable modules.

Abstract: Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most
semantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with
forward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC
framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity.
OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular
panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and
grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and
cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening
free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D
for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and
(iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level
motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic
occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and
Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic
occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new
state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and
popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08
(cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround
perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly
available at https://github.com/MasterHow/OneOcc.

Abstract: This paper presents the innovative design and successful deployment of a
pioneering autonomous unmanned aerial system developed for executing the
world's largest mural painted by a drone. Addressing the dual challenges of
maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse
outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a

and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying
mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent
airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's
critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and
consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for
autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications
of robotics in creative fields.

### [105] [Benchmarking ResNet for Short-Term Hypoglycemia Classification with DiaData](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02849)
*Beyza Cinar,Maria Maleshkova*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study improves data quality for Type 1 Diabetes analysis by cleaning DiaData (15 datasets, 2510 subjects), using outlier detection, gap imputation, and demonstrating improved hypoglycemia classification performance with quality-refined data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individualized therapy for Type 1 Diabetes requires reliable data analysis, but current datasets suffer from outliers, noise, small volumes, and missing values that limit analysis reliability.

Method: 1) Outlier identification with IQR and replacement with missing values; 2) Gap imputation: small gaps (≤25 min) with linear interpolation, larger gaps (30-120 min) with Stineman interpolation; 3) Correlation analysis between glucose and heart rate; 4) Hypoglycemia classification benchmark using ResNet model.

Result: Stineman interpolation provides more realistic glucose estimates than linear interpolation for larger gaps. Moderate correlation found between glucose and heart rate 15-60 minutes before hypoglycemia. Quality-refined data yields 2-3% performance gain in hypoglycemia classification, and more data improves performance by 7%.

Conclusion: Data quality improvement methods significantly enhance Type 1 Diabetes analysis reliability, with quality-refined data providing measurable performance gains in hypoglycemia prediction tasks.

Abstract: Individualized therapy is driven forward by medical data analysis, which
provides insight into the patient's context. In particular, for Type 1 Diabetes
(T1D), which is an autoimmune disease, relationships between demographics,
sensor data, and context can be analyzed. However, outliers, noisy data, and
small data volumes cannot provide a reliable analysis. Hence, the research
domain requires large volumes of high-quality data. Moreover, missing values
can lead to information loss. To address this limitation, this study improves
the data quality of DiaData, an integration of 15 separate datasets containing
glucose values from 2510 subjects with T1D. Notably, we make the following
contributions: 1) Outliers are identified with the interquartile range (IQR)
approach and treated by replacing them with missing values. 2) Small gaps
($\le$ 25 min) are imputed with linear interpolation and larger gaps ($\ge$ 30
and $<$ 120 min) with Stineman interpolation. Based on a visual comparison,
Stineman interpolation provides more realistic glucose estimates than linear
interpolation for larger gaps. 3) After data cleaning, the correlation between
glucose and heart rate is analyzed, yielding a moderate relation between 15 and
60 minutes before hypoglycemia ($\le$ 70 mg/dL). 4) Finally, a benchmark for
hypoglycemia classification is provided with a state-of-the-art ResNet model.
The model is trained with the Maindatabase and Subdatabase II of DiaData to
classify hypoglycemia onset up to 2 hours in advance. Training with more data
improves performance by 7% while using quality-refined data yields a 2-3% gain
compared to raw data.

### [106] [NEF-NET+: Adapting Electrocardio panorama in the wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02880)
*Zehui Zhan,Yaojun Hu,Jiajing Zhan,Wanchen Lian,Wanqing Wu,Jintai Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: NEF-NET+ is an enhanced framework for panoramic ECG synthesis that reconstructs continuous electrocardiac fields, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from arbitrary viewpoints while addressing real-world challenges like long-duration modeling, device artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-lead ECG systems have fixed anatomical viewpoints, which may miss diagnostically critical patterns for certain cardiac conditions like Brugada syndrome that require non-standard viewpoints. Previous Nef-Net had limitations in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses a newly designed model architecture with direct view transformation, incorporating offline pretraining, device calibration tuning, and on-the-fly patient-specific adaptation steps. Constructed Panobench benchmark with 5367 recordings and 48-view per subject.

Result: NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, achieving around 6 dB increase in PSNR in real-world settings, and supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view with cross-device generalization.

Conclusion: The enhanced framework successfully addresses real-world challenges in panoramic ECG synthesis, enabling more robust and flexible cardiac signal observation from arbitrary viewpoints for improved diagnosis of cardiac conditions.

Abstract: Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac
signals from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement.
However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require
additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns
that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this
limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous
electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from
arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net
operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as
long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and
suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an
enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports
arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG
devices, and compensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode
placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model
architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow
comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an
on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously
evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama
benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per
subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity.
Experimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over
Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The
code and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.

*Yize Liu,Yunyun Hou,Aina Sui*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for efficient multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs, achieving high success rates with significantly reduced query overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red teaming approaches for LLM security evaluation lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories and overlook the high overhead of attack processes.

Method: Introduced a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology to abstract multi-turn attacks as path planning, and developed ABC algorithm with collaborative search mechanism using employed, onlooker, and scout bees.

Result: Achieved attack success rates above 90% across five language models (peak 98% on GPT-3.5-Turbo), with only 26 queries on average, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The ABC algorithm effectively improves attack efficiency while substantially reducing red teaming overhead, demonstrating superior performance in identifying LLM vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various
applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised
increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations,
utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.
However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue
trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the
considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these
limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on
dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process
as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an
enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a
collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This
algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search
while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical
evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates
above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success
with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead
and highlighting its superior efficiency.

### [108] [Watermarking Large Language Models in Europe: Interpreting the AI Act in Light of Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03641)
*Thomas Souverain*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how to evaluate LLM watermarks against EU AI Act requirements (reliable, interoperable, effective, robust), proposing a taxonomy, evaluation framework, and comparison showing no current method meets all standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The EU AI Act requires watermarking for general-purpose AI models, but there's no clear framework to evaluate if watermarks meet the four standards: reliable, interoperable, effective, and robust.

Method: Proposes taxonomy of watermarking methods by LLM lifecycle stage, maps EU criteria to state-of-the-art evaluations, defines interoperability dimensions, and compares current methods against operationalized standards.

Result: Comparison shows no current watermarking approach satisfies all four EU standards, with interoperability being particularly underdeveloped in current research.

Conclusion: Recommends further research into watermarking embedded within LLM architecture and calls for more work to meet EU requirements, especially on interoperability.

Abstract: To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,
the AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their
general-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods
that are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,
the rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large
Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards
can be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses
this challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the
multiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct
concepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking
Categorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods
according to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,
during, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)
Watermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping
each criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and
detectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since
interoperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we
propose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking
Comparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the
operationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all
four standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further
research into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture
of LLMs.

*Chukwuemeka Arua Kalu,Adaobi Chiazor Emegoakor,Fortune Okafor,Augustine Okoh Uchenna,Chijioke Kelvin Ukpai,Godsent Erere Onyeugbo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Medical image segmentation study using BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset shows that nnU-Net trained on original 60 MRI cases outperformed models trained on augmented datasets, achieving 0.84 Dice score for whole tumor segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate medical image segmentation models for under-represented regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on glioma segmentation from multimodal MRI data.

Method: Used BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset with 60 multimodal MRI cases, compared nnU-Net performance on original dataset vs. offline-augmented dataset (360 cases), leveraging nnU-Net's online augmentation procedures.

Result: nnU-Net trained on original 60 cases achieved better performance (Dice score 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation) than models trained on offline-augmented dataset, suggesting offline augmentations introduced artificial variances that reduced generalization.

Conclusion: Data quality and proper augmentation approaches are crucial for building accurate, generalizable medical image segmentation models, especially for under-represented populations.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical achievement in modern medical
science, developed over decades of research. It allows for the exact
delineation of anatomical and pathological features in two- or
three-dimensional pictures by utilizing notions like pixel intensity, texture,
and anatomical context. With the advent of automated segmentation, physicians
and radiologists may now concentrate on diagnosis and treatment planning while
intelligent computers perform routine image processing tasks.
  This study used the BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset, a selected subset of
the BraTS dataset that included 60 multimodal MRI cases from patients with
glioma. Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances
performed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of
360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial
anatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In
contrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online
augmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better
results. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation.
These findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper
augmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture
segmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.

Conclusion: Radiomics-guided domain adaptation is valuable for robust glioma segmentation in resource-limited settings with heterogeneous imaging protocols.

Abstract: Glioma segmentation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
remains challenging in Sub-Saharan Africa due to limited MRI infrastructure and

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning pipeline combining ResNet-50 CNN and Vision Transformer achieves 84.2% accuracy in ovarian cancer subtype classification and can infer gene mutations (TP53, BRCA1, ARID1A) directly from H&E histopathological images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ovarian cancer has high mortality due to late diagnosis and heterogeneity. Current diagnostic methods lack ability to reveal genomic variations needed for precision oncology.

Method: Developed a fusion model combining ResNet-50 CNN encoder and Vision Transformer using ~45,000 H&E image patches from TCGA and public datasets to capture both local morphological texture and global tissue context.

Result: Achieved 84.2% subtype classification accuracy (Macro AUC 0.87±0.03) and gene mutation inference: TP53 AUC 0.82±0.02, BRCA1 AUC 0.76±0.04, ARID1A AUC 0.73±0.05. Nuclear solidity and eccentricity were key predictors for TP53 mutation.

Conclusion: Quantifiable histological phenotypes encode measurable genomic signals, enabling cost-effective precision histopathology for ovarian cancer diagnosis and triage.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies,
largely due to late diagnosis and extensive heterogeneity across subtypes.
Current diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to reveal underlying
genomic variations essential for precision oncology. This study introduces a
novel hybrid deep learning pipeline that integrates quantitative nuclear
morphometry with deep convolutional image features to perform ovarian cancer
subtype classification and gene mutation inference directly from Hematoxylin
and Eosin (H&E) histopathological images. Using $\sim45,000$ image patches
sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and public datasets, a fusion model
combining a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) was developed. This model successfully captured both local
morphological texture and global tissue context. The pipeline achieved a robust
overall subtype classification accuracy of $84.2\%$ (Macro AUC of $0.87 \pm
0.03$). Crucially, the model demonstrated the capacity for gene mutation
inference with moderate-to-high accuracy: $AUC_{TP53} = 0.82 \pm 0.02$,
$AUC_{BRCA1} = 0.76 \pm 0.04$, and $AUC_{ARID1A} = 0.73 \pm 0.05$. Feature
importance analysis established direct quantitative links, revealing that
nuclear solidity and eccentricity were the dominant predictors for TP53
mutation. These findings validate that quantifiable histological phenotypes
encode measurable genomic signals, paving the way for cost-effective, precision
histopathology in ovarian cancer triage and diagnosis.
