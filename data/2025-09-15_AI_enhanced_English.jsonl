This paper\npresents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on\nmicro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature\ndetection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and\nquantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips\n(SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline\nreduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion\nscenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an\nultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy\nafter quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods,\nwas implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the\ngap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on\ncomputationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for\nmicrocontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates\nan average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline\npipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational\ncomplexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par\ntracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24\npixels/frame.", "AI": {"tldr": "An optimized Visual Inertial Odometry pipeline for micro/nano-UAVs using quantized feature tracking methods on RISC-V SoCs, achieving 3.65x RMSE reduction with real-time performance.", "motivation": "Bridge the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines requiring powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for microcontrollers on resource-constrained UAV platforms.", "method": "Developed VIO pipeline with optimized/quantized feature detection (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB) for RISC-V SoCs, incorporating rigid body motion model to reduce estimation errors in planar motion.", "result": "Achieved 3.65x average RMSE reduction over baseline using ORB tracker on GAP9 SoC; PX4FLOW matched ORB accuracy at lower runtime for speeds <24 pixels/frame.", "conclusion": "The pipeline successfully enables high-accuracy VIO on ultra-low-power systems, making it suitable for real-time applications on micro- and nano-UAVs with constrained computational resources."}}

The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early\ndetection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,\nenvironmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved\ndetection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all\ngrowth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy\nand 95.37 percent recall. These results demonstrate the strong potential of\ntemporal multispectral analysis and LSTM networks for early broomrape\ndetection. While further real-world data collection is needed for practical\ndeployment, this study shows that UAV-based multispectral sensing coupled with\ndeep learning could provide a powerful precision agriculture tool to reduce\nlosses and improve sustainability in tomato production.", "AI": {"tldr": "Combined drone multispectral imagery with LSTM deep learning and SMOTE to detect parasitic broomrape in tomatoes, achieving 88.37% accuracy and 95.37% recall by integrating multiple growth stages.", "motivation": "Branched broomrape poses a serious threat to California's tomato industry (90% of US processing tomatoes), with difficult early detection due to its underground lifecycle and ineffective conventional chemical controls.", "method": "Used drone-based multispectral imagery with LSTM networks and SMOTE for class imbalance, conducted on infested tomato farm across five growth stages determined by growing degree days, processed images to isolate tomato canopy reflectance.", "result": "At 897 GDD, achieved 79.09% accuracy and 70.36% recall without later stages.

Specifically, we\nconstruct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial\nrelationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed\ninto a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges,\nwhich are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph\nconstraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint\nsolver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's\nnavigation path and final goal.
