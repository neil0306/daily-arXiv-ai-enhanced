<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze emerging research that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and non-English contexts, as pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social biases as English-only models.

Method: Systematic review of studies examining bias evaluation and mitigation in multilingual contexts, with analysis focused on linguistic diversity, cultural awareness, evaluation metrics, and mitigation techniques.

Result: Identified gaps in methodological design choices including preference for certain languages and scarcity of multilingual mitigation experiments, while cataloging common issues and solutions in adapting bias benchmarks across languages and cultures.

Conclusion: The findings chart directions for future research to enhance multilingual bias literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

### [2] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that structured prompting strategies (especially chain-of-thought + sequential) significantly improve midsized language models for automatic generation of multiple choice questions, outperforming larger untuned models in educational assessment contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development for morphological assessment by using language models to automatically generate multiple choice questions (MCQs).

Method: Two-fold approach: 1) compared fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B) vs larger untuned model (GPT-3.5, 175B); 2) evaluated seven structured prompting strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Used automated metrics, expert scoring, and GPT-4.1 simulation for evaluation.

Result: Structured prompting, especially chain-of-thought + sequential strategies, significantly improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma produced more construct-aligned and instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses. Prompt design was crucial for mid-size model performance.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance midsized models for automatic item generation under limited data conditions. Combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation ensures alignment with assessment goals, offering a practical workflow for K-12 language assessment development.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing complexity of cyber-physical systems and limited interoperability of SystemC TLM with other engineering domains creates integration challenges for cross-domain co-simulation.

Method: Encapsulate SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co-Simulation Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) using a lightweight open-source toolchain, addressing time synchronization and data exchange challenges.

Result: Feasibility and effectiveness demonstrated through representative case studies, enabling seamless standardized integration across heterogeneous simulation environments.

Conclusion: The proposed open-source approach successfully bridges SystemC TLM with FMI-based workflows, facilitating cross-domain co-simulation for complex cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO enables small language models to perform agentic RAG tasks through teacher demonstration initialization and continuous guidance, achieving performance comparable to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models struggle with agentic RAG behaviors due to poor reasoning ability, sparse rewards, and unstable training, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO) uses cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization to train compact models.

Result: DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming larger teacher models in some cases, as measured by the new ARC metric.

Conclusion: DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments by effectively training small models through teacher-guided policy optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD is a testing framework that converts high-level AI ethics guidelines into actionable test questions to verify LLM compliance, including jailbreak diagnostics to identify safety bypass scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between high-level government AI ethics guidelines and actionable testing methods to verify LLM compliance and prevent harmful responses.

Method: Automated generation of guideline-violating questions from government guidelines, integration of jailbreak diagnostics (GUARD-JD) to provoke unethical responses, and comprehensive compliance reporting.

Result: Empirically validated on 7 LLMs including Vicuna-13B, GPT-4, and Claude-3.7, showing effectiveness in testing compliance under three government guidelines and transferring jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models.

Conclusion: GUARD provides a practical framework for operationalizing AI ethics guidelines into testable compliance measures, enhancing the reliability of LLM-based applications through systematic safety testing.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR is a novel framework that enhances long-context comprehension in LLMs through graph-based reasoning, addressing memory limitations and hallucination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long contexts due to memory constraints, inability to handle complex long-context tasks, lack of transparency, and tendency to produce hallucinations.

Method: JERR integrates three components: synopsis extraction through strategic text chunking, directed acyclic graph (DAG) construction to resolve redundancy, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for navigating complex reasoning paths.

Result: JERR consistently outperforms all baselines on ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel solution enabling LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with improved reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using NP-hard graph problems as synthetic training data to develop long chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving strong generalization across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Long CoT development relies on costly human-curated datasets (math/code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. NP-hard graph problems inherently require deep reasoning and extensive exploration similar to Long CoT.

Method: Two-stage post-training: (1) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning on rejection-sampled NP-hard graph instances to enhance reasoning depth, (2) Reinforcement Learning with fine-grained reward design to sharpen reasoning efficiency.

Result: Graph-R1-7B model demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, surpassing QwQ-32B on NP-hard graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency.

Conclusion: NP-hard graph problems serve as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening new frontiers for LLM post-training.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes CAPE framework for context-aware personality evaluation of LLMs, showing conversational history enhances consistency but causes personality shifts, with GPT models being more robust while Gemini and Llama are context-sensitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional psychometric tests for LLMs use context-free approaches that ignore real-world conversational history, creating an artificial evaluation setting that doesn't reflect actual usage scenarios.

Method: Developed Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework incorporating prior conversational interactions, introduced novel metrics to quantify response consistency, and conducted experiments on 7 LLMs including GPT models, Gemini, and Llama.

Result: Conversational history enhances response consistency via in-context learning but induces personality shifts; GPT models show robustness to question ordering while Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama-8B are highly sensitive; GPT responses stem from intrinsic traits and context, while others depend heavily on prior interactions.

Conclusion: Context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better align with human judgments, demonstrating the importance of context-aware evaluation for more realistic assessment of LLM behavioral traits.

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reasoning step utility affects final answer accuracy in LLMs, finding that decreasing conditional entropy during reasoning strongly correlates with correct answers, while flat/increasing entropy leads to wrong answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intermediate reasoning steps contribute to final answer correctness and develop methods to detect unproductive reasoning early to avoid generating ineffective steps.

Method: Oracle study using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains on MATH dataset, then using Qwen3-8B to quantify utility by measuring conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood) of answer span at each reasoning step.

Result: Clear pattern: decreasing conditional entropy over reasoning steps strongly associated with correct answers; flat or increasing entropy leads to wrong answers. Incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones.

Conclusion: Longer reasoning doesn't guarantee better outcomes. Findings provide foundation for designing efficient reasoning pipelines that can detect and avoid unproductive reasoning early during generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench is the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs in dentistry, featuring 36,597 QA questions across 16 subfields and a 337M token corpus for domain adaptation, revealing significant performance gaps and demonstrating substantial improvements through domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and medical LLMs show strong performance on general medical benchmarks but their capabilities in specialized fields like dentistry remain underexplored due to lack of targeted evaluation resources.

Method: Developed DentalBench with two components: DentalQA (bilingual question-answering benchmark with 36,597 questions across 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields) and DentalCorpus (337.35M token corpus for domain adaptation supporting SFT and RAG). Evaluated 14 LLMs including proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models.

Result: Revealed significant performance gaps across task types and languages. Domain adaptation with Qwen-2.5-3B substantially improved performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-specific benchmarks are crucial for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications, with domain adaptation showing significant improvements in specialized medical fields like dentistry.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

### [12] [KG-CQR: Leveraging Structured Relation Representations in Knowledge Graphs for Contextual Query Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20417)
*Chi Minh Bui,Ngoc Mai Thieu,Van Vinh Nguyen,Json J. Jung,Khac-Hoai Nam Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR is a novel framework that enhances retrieval-augmented generation by using knowledge graphs to enrich query contexts, achieving 4-6% mAP and 2-3% Recall@25 improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods that primarily handle corpus-level context loss, by focusing on query enrichment through structured knowledge graph representations for better retrieval performance.

Method: A model-agnostic pipeline with three modules: subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation, using corpus-centric knowledge graphs to enrich query representations without additional training.

Result: Superior performance on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG datasets with 4-6% mAP improvement and 2-3% Recall@25 improvement over strong baselines, plus consistent outperformance in multi-hop QA tasks.

Conclusion: KG-CQR effectively enhances retrieval effectiveness in RAG systems through knowledge graph-based query enrichment, demonstrating scalability across different LLM sizes and strong performance on challenging retrieval tasks.

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

TL;DR: A specialized benchmark for evaluating LLMs in civil aviation maintenance, addressing the lack of domain-specific evaluation tools and enabling targeted improvements through performance assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in LLM evaluation tools for civil aviation maintenance, which requires sophisticated reasoning and domain knowledge but lacks specialized benchmarks unlike mathematical and coding domains.

Method: Developed an industrial-grade benchmark for civil aviation maintenance that evaluates LLM capabilities, domain knowledge gaps, and complex reasoning. Also used the benchmark to assess existing vector embedding models and LLMs in RAG systems for practical applications.

Result: The benchmark effectively assesses model performance in civil aviation maintenance scenarios, identifies specific deficiencies, and provides a foundation for targeted improvements through domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized prompt engineering.

Conclusion: This work fills a significant gap in LLM evaluation by providing a specialized benchmark for civil aviation maintenance, enabling progress toward more intelligent solutions in this critical domain, with the benchmark and code being open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

Result: System successfully found same number of titles with highest average match score when testing with randomized titles from original dataset.

Conclusion: The CBR approach with TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity is effective for practical work title search and retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

TL;DR: MCP-Bench is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on realistic multi-step tasks requiring tool use, cross-tool coordination, and planning across 28 live MCP servers with 250 tools spanning multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate LLMs' capabilities in realistic multi-step tool usage, cross-tool coordination, and planning across diverse domains with rich input-output coupling.

Method: Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP), connecting LLMs to 28 live MCP servers with 250 tools across finance, travel, scientific computing, and academic search domains. Uses multi-faceted evaluation covering schema understanding, trajectory planning, and task completion.

Result: Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in handling the complex, multi-step tasks presented by MCP-Bench.

Conclusion: MCP-Bench provides a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation framework for LLM tool usage capabilities, exposing significant gaps in current models' abilities to handle complex multi-domain workflows and tool coordination.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

*Yucheng Ruan,Xiang Lan,Daniel J. Tan,Hairil Rizal Abdullah,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deep learning framework using NLP to integrate multimodal EHRs (structured data + free-text notes) for predicting ICU mortality and resource utilization, showing improved performance and robustness against data corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus mainly on structured EHRs and ignore valuable clinical insights in free-text notes. The potential of textual information within structured data is not fully leveraged for mortality and resource utilization prediction in ICU settings.

Method: Developed a deep learning framework with natural language processing techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs. Used two real-world EHR datasets, performed ablation studies on medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained sentence encoder, and assessed robustness against structured data corruption.

Result: Model improved performance by 1.6%/0.8% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, and 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical duration estimation compared to best existing methods. Showed superior performance across tasks at different corruption rates.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and accurate for predicting mortality and resource utilization in critical care. Successfully uses prompt learning with transformer encoder for multimodal EHR analysis and demonstrates strong resilience to data corruption, especially at high corruption levels.

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

*Luke Bates,Max Glockner,Preslav Nakov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConspirED dataset captures cognitive traits of conspiracy theories, used to develop detection models and test LLM vulnerabilities to conspiratorial content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conspiracy theories erode public trust and resist debunking, while AI-generated misinformation requires understanding rhetorical patterns for interventions like prebunking.

Method: Created ConspirED dataset with multi-sentence excerpts annotated using CONSPIR cognitive framework, then developed computational models and evaluated LLM robustness.

Result: Both computational models and LLMs were misaligned by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors conspiratorial reasoning patterns even when deflecting fact-checked misinformation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates vulnerabilities in AI systems to conspiratorial content and provides a framework for developing better detection and intervention tools.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Seng Mai,Keita Kurabe,Yusuke Sakai,Georgina Agyei,Soudabeh Eslami,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLORES+ benchmark has quality issues - translations fall below claimed standards, contain cultural bias, and simple heuristics can inflate scores, making it unreliable for true multilingual evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify shortcomings in the widely used FLORES+ multilingual MT benchmark and assess its suitability for evaluating truly multilingual translation systems.

Method: Human assessment of translations in 4 languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, South Azerbaijani), analysis of quality standards, testing simple heuristics like named entity copying, and comparing model performance on FLORES+ vs domain-relevant evaluation sets.

Result: Many translations fall below the claimed 90% quality standard, source sentences are domain-specific and culturally biased, simple heuristics yield non-trivial BLEU scores, and models trained on high-quality data perform poorly on FLORES+ but well on domain-relevant sets.

Conclusion: Multilingual MT benchmarks should use domain-general and culturally neutral source texts with less reliance on named entities to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic is an LLM-enhanced topic discovery method that uses textual encoding and space optimization with entropy sampling and triplet tasks to improve scientific topic identification, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic discovery methods rely on word embeddings and struggle with complex text relationships in scientific publications, lacking comprehensive understanding of the content.

Method: Builds a textual encoder for scientific publications, constructs space optimization with entropy-based sampling and LLM-guided triplet tasks, and fine-tunes the encoder using contrastive loss optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show SciTopic outperforms state-of-the-art scientific topic discovery methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-enhanced approach enables researchers to gain deeper and faster insights into scientific topics through improved discrimination of different thematic content.

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework to handle multi-domain non-IID data challenges in federated learning, with comprehensive benchmarking for real-world NLP scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning approaches primarily focus on label diversity but neglect the crucial input domain diversity in NLP tasks, limiting their effectiveness in real-world multi-domain environments.

Method: Introduces a unified benchmarking framework with multi-domain non-IID scenarios and proposes AdaFD framework that adaptively handles both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings to capture client diversity.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed models effectively capture local client diversity and achieve superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The AdaFD framework successfully addresses multi-domain non-IID challenges in federated learning, providing a more realistic and effective solution for NLP applications with diverse data distributions.

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

TL;DR: Proposes a novel generative framework for Query-Driven Text Summarization that outperforms traditional extractive methods while maintaining high deployment efficiency with only 0.1B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional extractive summarization models suffer from cumulative information loss in multi-stage pipelines and lack sufficient semantic understanding for complex search intents in industrial web search applications.

Method: Integrates large model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to transform a lightweight 0.1B parameter model into a domain-specialized QDTS expert.

Result: Outperforms production baseline and achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple industry-relevant metrics, with excellent deployment efficiency (334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs for ~50,000 QPS at 55ms latency).

Conclusion: The framework successfully pioneers generative models for real-time QDTS in industrial web search, demonstrating superior performance and practical deployment efficiency compared to traditional extractive approaches.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

TL;DR: KCS framework improves multi-hop QA by sampling diverse knowledge compositions using probabilistic contrastive loss and stochastic decoding, achieving 3.9% accuracy improvement in knowledge selection and better performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data sparsity in multi-hop QA that leads to spurious patterns, overcoming limitations of previous methods that generate simple questions without integrating essential document knowledge.

Method: Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS) models knowledge composition selection as sentence-level conditional prediction with probabilistic contrastive loss, using stochastic decoding for inference to balance accuracy and diversity.

Result: 3.9% improvement in knowledge composition selection accuracy, and data augmentation with KCS yields improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

Conclusion: KCS effectively expands question diversity by sampling varied knowledge compositions, demonstrating superior performance over baselines and practical utility for multi-hop QA data augmentation.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: Current GLM benchmarks are inadequate as they can be solved with unimodal information alone. The CLEGR benchmark is introduced to properly evaluate multimodal graph-language reasoning, revealing that current GLMs struggle with structural reasoning and that GNN backbones may not be necessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GLM evaluation benchmarks are insufficient because they are repurposed node classification datasets that don't require true multimodal reasoning - strong performance can be achieved using only unimodal information.

Method: Introduced CLEGR benchmark with synthetic graph generation pipeline and questions requiring joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. Evaluated representative GLM architectures and compared against soft-prompted LLM baselines.

Result: Soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with full GNN-backed GLMs, questioning the architectural necessity of graph structure incorporation. GLMs show significant performance degradation in structural reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Current GLMs have limitations in graph reasoning capabilities. The findings provide foundation for advancing explicit multimodal reasoning involving both graph structure and language.

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: A novel named entity correction method that uses speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities and a generative approach to annotate and correct entity errors in ASR transcripts, particularly effective when word forms differ significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR systems often fail to transcribe domain-specific named entities, causing downstream task failures. Existing phonetic-based correction methods struggle when wrongly-transcribed words and ground-truth entities have significantly different forms.

Method: Utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities, then employs a generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace text with correct entities.

Result: Significant improvement in entity accuracy demonstrated on both open-source and self-constructed test sets, particularly effective in scenarios with word form differences.

Conclusion: The proposed NEC method effectively addresses limitations of phonetic-based approaches by leveraging speech sound features and generative annotation, providing substantial entity correction improvements. The authors will open source their test set and training data.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

TL;DR: HArch is the first multi-lingual multi-label classification model for implicit discourse relation recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results by leveraging hierarchical dependencies and outperforming large language models through task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for multi-lingual and multi-label classification in implicit discourse relation recognition, which previous models lacked, and to demonstrate the superiority of task-specific fine-tuning over prompting approaches using large language models.

Method: Developed HArch model that uses hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability distributions across all three sense levels in PDTB 3.0 framework. Evaluated on DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus with various pre-trained encoder backbones (RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa) and compared against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting.

Result: RoBERTa-HArch achieved best performance in English, XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performed best in multi-lingual setting. Fine-tuned models consistently outperformed GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick across all language configurations. Also achieved state-of-the-art results on DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach of HArch is highly effective for implicit discourse relation recognition, demonstrating that task-specific fine-tuning provides significant advantages over prompting large language models, with strong performance across both monolingual and multi-lingual settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

Motivation: Large language models have improved text generation but created tokenization inconsistency problems between sender and receiver in steganography/watermarking, undermining robustness.

Method: Proposes two tailored solutions: stepwise verification method for steganography and post-hoc rollback method for watermarking, based on identifying problematic tokens with infrequency and temporariness characteristics.

Result: Experiments show improved fluency, imperceptibility, anti-steganalysis capacity for steganography, and enhanced detectability and robustness against attacks for watermarking.

Conclusion: Directly addressing tokenization inconsistency through targeted methods outperforms traditional disambiguation approaches and significantly improves both steganography and watermarking performance.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

*Ning Shang,Yifei Liu,Yi Zhu,Li Lyna Zhang,Weijiang Xu,Xinyu Guan,Buze Zhang,Bingcheng Dong,Xudong Zhou,Bowen Zhang,Ying Xin,Ziming Miao,Scarlett Li,Fan Yang,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent is a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance through efficient RL infrastructure, novel algorithms, and multi-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a math reasoning model that goes beyond traditional chain-of-thought approaches by enabling advanced cognitive behaviors like careful thinking before tool use and autonomous verification of intermediate steps in complex problem-solving.

Method: Uses agentic reinforcement learning with three key innovations: (1) efficient RL infrastructure with reliable Python code environment for high-throughput execution, (2) GRPO-RoC algorithm with Resample-on-Correct strategy to handle coding environment noise, (3) multi-stage training starting with non-reasoning SFT progressing through RL stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly shorter responses. Trained in only 510 RL steps within one week using 64 MI300X GPUs.

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent demonstrates that agentic reinforcement learning can effectively scale to create advanced reasoning models with strong generalization to mathematics, alignment, scientific reasoning, and tool-use tasks, achieving frontier performance with minimal compute resources.

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

### [30] [Leveraging Semantic Triples for Private Document Generation with Local Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20736)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-ST introduces semantic triple-based document generation under local differential privacy, enabling coherent text privatization at lower ε values through neighborhood-aware processing and LLM post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current local DP text privatization methods require high ε values for reasonable utility, making privacy protection demanding. The paper aims to address this challenge by developing a more effective approach that works at lower privacy budgets.

Method: DP-ST leverages semantic triples for neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP. It uses a divide-and-conquer paradigm with LLM post-processing to maintain text coherence while providing privacy guarantees.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness in achieving balanced privatization outputs at reasonable ε levels, enabling coherent text generation even at lower privacy parameter values while maintaining privacy-utility balance.

Conclusion: Semantic triple-based approaches with neighborhood-aware processing and LLM post-processing are crucial for achieving coherent and privacy-preserving text generation under local differential privacy at practical ε values.

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning general-purpose LLM-based embedding models achieves state-of-the-art performance for implicit hate speech detection, with significant improvements in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is challenging to detect due to its indirect nature and lack of explicit derogatory words, requiring sophisticated detection methods beyond traditional approaches.

Method: Solely fine-tuning recent general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs) such as Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, without additional external knowledge or context.

Result: Achieved up to 1.10 percentage points improvement for in-dataset evaluation and up to 20.35 percentage points improvement in cross-dataset evaluation in terms of F1-macro score across multiple IHS datasets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning general-purpose LLM-based embedding models is an effective approach for implicit hate speech detection, outperforming previous methods and showing strong generalization capabilities across different datasets.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

*Yuanhao Ding,Esteban Garces Arias,Meimingwei Li,Julian Rodemann,Matthias Aßenmacher,Danlu Chen,Gaojuan Fan,Christian Heumann,Chongsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD is a self-adaptive decoding method that balances text diversity and coherence using global and local uncertainty signals, achieving faster generation with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between coherence and diversity in open-ended text generation, overcoming limitations of contrastive search methods like hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs.

Method: Proposes GUARD - a 'Glocal' uncertainty-driven framework combining global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations, plus a token-count-based penalty to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Achieves good balance between text diversity and coherence, shows substantial improvements in generation speed, and demonstrates strong performance in both human and LLM evaluations.

Conclusion: GUARD effectively addresses the coherence-diversity trade-off with theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency, making it a promising decoding approach for open-ended text generation.

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

*Xiaoyi Wang,Jiwei Zhang,Guangtao Zhang,Honglei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated therapy dialogues lack emotional authenticity compared to real CBT sessions, showing less variability and weaker emotional dynamics, especially for client roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether synthetic therapy dialogues from LLMs accurately capture the nuanced emotional dynamics present in real cognitive behavioral therapy sessions.

Method: Adapted Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze emotional trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions in both real (transcribed from public videos) and synthetic (CACTUS dataset) CBT dialogues, examining full dialogues and individual speaker roles.

Result: Synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent but diverge significantly from real conversations - real sessions show greater emotional variability, more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of emotional reactivity and regulation. Emotional arc similarity is particularly low for client roles.

Conclusion: Current LLM-generated therapy data has limitations in emotional fidelity, highlighting the need for more authentic emotional modeling in mental health applications. Introduced RealCBT dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

*Harethah Abu Shairah,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,George Turkiyyah,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROSI is a white-box method that amplifies LLM safety alignment by permanently steering activations toward refusal-mediating subspaces through rank-one weight modifications, improving safety refusal rates without fine-tuning while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms in LLMs can be bypassed by removing specific representational directions, so there's a need for methods that actively amplify safety alignment rather than just preventing bypasses.

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) - a fine-tuning-free approach that applies rank-one weight modifications to all residual stream write matrices, computed from harmful/harmless instruction pairs to steer activations toward refusal-mediating subspaces.

Result: ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates (evaluated by Llama Guard 3) while preserving utility on standard benchmarks (MMLU, HellaSwag, Arc). It can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their latent safety directions.

Conclusion: Targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and effective mechanism to improve LLM safety that complements more resource-intensive fine-tuning approaches, serving as an effective last-mile safety procedure.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First cross-lingual study on cognitive distortion detection in Dutch adolescent forum posts, showing language/style changes affect performance but domain adaptation works best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising youth mental health issues need automated detection of cognitive distortions for early intervention, but prior work only focused on English clinical data.

Method: Cross-lingual and cross-register generalization analysis using forum posts from Dutch adolescents, testing domain adaptation methods.

Result: Changes in language and writing style significantly impact model performance, but domain adaptation methods show the most promise.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation is crucial for effective cross-lingual cognitive distortion detection, enabling better mental health monitoring across different languages and registers.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

*Jie Zhao,Wanting Ning,Yuxiao Fei,Yubo Feng,Lishuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDLLM is a novel approach that enhances Large Language Models for Event Temporal Relation Extraction by incorporating distance-aware graph structures and temporal feature learning to better handle long-distance dependencies and minority classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models struggle with minority class relations due to limited pre-trained knowledge, while Large Language Models using manual prompts introduce noise that interferes with long-distance dependency judgment between events.

Method: Proposes GDLLM - a Global Distance-aware modeling approach using Graph Attention Network (GAT) to capture long-distance dependencies, and a temporal feature learning paradigm with soft inference to enhance short-distance proximity identification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TB-Dense and MATRES datasets, substantially enhancing minority relation class performance and overall learning ability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures global features, improving both minority class handling and overall temporal relation extraction performance through distance-aware modeling and enhanced attention mechanisms.

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating RAG systems on multi-source information integration and long-form synthesis tasks, with two new benchmarks showing retrieval effectiveness is crucial and reasoning models outperform standard LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require RAG systems to integrate information from multiple sources where no single source is sufficient, but current evaluations focus on single-source or factoid-based settings.

Method: Developed a scalable framework to create evaluation benchmarks (MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet) for multi-source retrieval and synthesis, testing various RAG pipelines with sparse/dense retrievers and frontier LLMs.

Result: Generation quality heavily depends on retrieval effectiveness, which varies by task. Multi-source synthesis remains challenging even with oracle retrieval, but reasoning models significantly outperform standard LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework enables better evaluation of RAG systems for complex multi-source tasks, revealing critical dependencies between retrieval and generation components, and showing reasoning models excel at synthesis.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First large-scale evaluation of post-training quantization on machine translation across 55 languages shows 4-bit quantization preserves quality for high-resource languages but causes significant degradation for low-resource languages, especially at 2-bit precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models on resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks remain underexplored, particularly for machine translation across diverse languages.

Method: Conducted evaluation of post-training quantization using five LLMs (1.7B to 70B parameters) across 55 languages, comparing four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, AutoRound) and analyzing interactions with decoding hyperparameters and calibration languages.

Result: 4-bit quantization preserves translation quality for high-resource languages and large models, but significant degradation occurs for low-resource and typologically diverse languages, especially at 2-bit. GGUF variants provide most consistent performance even at 2-bit precision.

Conclusion: Quantization algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. Language-matched calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Findings provide actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs under quantization constraints, especially for low-resource settings.

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on

post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource

four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models remains a fundamental challenge, as existing cascaded approaches disregard acoustic features and there's a scarcity of speech preference data for proper evaluation.

Method: Proposes SageLM with three key innovations: 1) Joint assessment of semantic and acoustic dimensions, 2) Rationale-based supervision for explainability and better alignment, 3) SpeechFeedback synthetic preference dataset and two-stage training paradigm to address data scarcity.

Result: SageLM achieves 82.79% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming cascaded baselines by 7.42% and SLM-based baselines by 26.20%.

Conclusion: SageLM provides a comprehensive and explainable framework for Speech-to-Speech LLM evaluation that effectively addresses both semantic and acoustic dimensions while overcoming data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with consistent reasoning, policy adherence, and information extraction in multi-turn conversational environments like τ-bench, requiring better input formulation.

Method: Proposed Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework that automatically reformulates user queries augmented with relevant domain rules and tool suggestions to improve agent decision making.

Result: IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1% respectively in overall pass^5 scores.

Conclusion: IRMA demonstrates superior reliability and consistency compared to other methods in dynamic environments, highlighting the importance of proper input formulation for LLM tool-use agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: A novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy for in-context learning that improves semantic parsing performance through structure-aware retrieval and plug-in enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL selection strategies for structured prediction tasks like semantic parsing often overlook structural alignment, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalization.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fine-tune BERT-based retriever with structure-aware supervision to select semantically relevant and structurally aligned exemplars; 2) Enhance retriever with plug-in module that amplifies syntactically meaningful information in hidden representations.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing baselines on four benchmarks spanning three semantic parsing tasks with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time models.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves strong balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance, with a model-agnostic plug-in that requires minimal overhead and integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works on proactive dialogue focus on domain-specific scenarios, leading to fragmented evaluations and limited exploration of models' comprehensive proactive conversation abilities.

Method: Proposed ProactiveEval framework that decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, establishes evaluation metrics, and enables automatic generation of diverse evaluation data across 6 domains with 328 environments.

Result: Experiments with 22 LLMs show DeepSeek-R1 excels in target planning while Claude-3.7-Sonnet performs best in dialogue guidance tasks.

Conclusion: The study investigates how reasoning capabilities influence proactive behaviors and discusses implications for future model development, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for proactive dialogue.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

*Chen Chen,Yuchen Sun,Jiaxin Gao,Xueluan Gong,Qian Wang,Ziyao Wang,Yongsen Zheng,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LETHE is a novel defense method that eliminates backdoor attacks from LLMs through internal knowledge dilution and external prompt distraction, achieving up to 98% reduction in attack success rate while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks but existing defenses lack comprehensiveness and fail against advanced scenarios like model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks.

Method: LETHE uses internal knowledge dilution by training a clean model and merging it with backdoored model, plus external distraction by incorporating benign evidence into prompts to shift attention from backdoor features.

Result: Outperforms 8 state-of-the-art baselines against 8 backdoor attacks, reduces attack success rate by up to 98% while maintaining utility, and proves cost-efficient and robust against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: LETHE provides a comprehensive and effective defense against advanced backdoor attacks in LLMs through dual internal-external mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASI-RAG is a structured method that enables SMEs to deploy RAG systems quickly without prior expertise, validated through a successful case study in an environmental testing laboratory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems address LLM limitations but are difficult for SMEs to deploy due to limited resources and NLP expertise, creating a barrier to adoption.

Method: EASI-RAG uses method engineering principles with defined roles, activities, and techniques to provide a structured, agile approach for RAG deployment in industrial SME contexts.

Result: The system was deployed in under a month by inexperienced teams, achieved high user adoption, delivered accurate answers, and improved data reliability in a real-world environmental testing case study.

Conclusion: EASI-RAG demonstrates successful RAG deployment in SMEs, showing potential for broader industrial adoption, though generalization across diverse use cases and integration with fine-tuned models need further exploration.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

### [46] [Re-Representation in Sentential Relation Extraction with Sequence Routing Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049)
*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes capsule networks with dynamic routing for sentential relation extraction, achieving SOTA results on multiple datasets but identifying noise in Wikidata labels and re-representation as key challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentential relation extraction performance using dynamic routing in capsules and understand why models perform well on some datasets but poorly on others like Wikidata.

Method: Uses capsule networks with dynamic routing mechanism for sentential relation extraction, comparing performance across multiple datasets including Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, Conll04, and Wikidata.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on common datasets but shows low performance on Wikidata due to label noise. Demonstrates better re-representation capability compared to vanilla models.

Conclusion: Noise in distantly supervised datasets and re-representation capability are identified as key challenges in sentential relation extraction, with capsule networks showing improved re-representation abilities.

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic approach combining LLMs with symbolic solvers for tax filing that improves accuracy, reduces costs below real-world averages, and enables equitable access to reliable tax assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax filing requires complex reasoning with overlapping rules and numerical calculations, where errors incur costly penalties. Modern LLMs alone are poorly suited due to accuracy and auditability requirements.

Method: Integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers, uses up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, and employs intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations.

Result: Dramatically improves performance on the SARA dataset and reduces costs well below real-world averages of $270 and 13 hours per tax filing.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for providing reliable, cost-effective tax assistance with equitable access.

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO method uses CHAIR metric to identify hallucinated vs non-hallucinated answers for DPO fine-tuning, reducing hallucinations in MLLMs without complex synthetic data pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the persistent problem of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) where models generate answers not supported by visual input, treating it as an alignment problem.

Method: Leverage the CHAIR metric to distinguish between hallucinated and non-hallucinated answers, then use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs with this preference data.

Result: CHAIR-DPO effectively reduces hallucinated answers across several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CHAIR-based rewards for alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a simpler alternative to complex synthetic data pipelines for hallucination reduction in MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

TL;DR: Integrates Stable Diffusion 3's multimodal capabilities for image forgery localization by treating forgery residuals as an explicit modality, achieving 12% performance improvement without requiring annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image forgery localization methods struggle with new manipulation technologies and rely on costly annotated data. Multi-modal large models like Stable Diffusion offer new opportunities for forensic analysis.

Method: Leverages SD3's multimodal framework by treating image forgery residuals (high-frequency signals) as an explicit modality, fusing them into latent space while preserving original semantic features.

Result: Achieves up to 12% performance improvement on benchmarking datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods, with strong generalization to unseen real-world document and natural scene forgery images.

Conclusion: The integration of SD3's multimodal capabilities provides an efficient and accurate solution for image forgery localization that doesn't require annotated data and generalizes well to various forgery types.

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

TL;DR: Combining multimodal LLMs with quantitative lesion attributes improves interpretability of skin cancer diagnosis AI models by grounding predictions in measurable clinical concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models show promise in skin disease diagnosis but lack interpretability needed for clinical use. MLLMs offer natural language reasoning while quantitative attributes provide measurable grounding for predictions.

Method: Fine-tune Multimodal Large Language Models to predict quantitative lesion attributes (e.g., lesion area) from images and evaluate grounding through attribute-specific content-based image retrieval on SLICE-3D dataset.

Result: Evidence shows MLLM embedding spaces can be effectively grounded in quantitative lesion attributes, enabling more interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: Combining MLLMs with quantitative attributes provides a promising approach to improve interpretability of AI skin cancer diagnosis models for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified Vision Transformer framework for automatic modulation recognition that combines supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives to achieve label-efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AMR solutions require large labeled datasets or complex multi-stage training, limiting scalability and generalization in practical wireless communication scenarios.

Method: ViT encoder with lightweight convolutional decoder and linear classifier; uses reconstruction branch to map augmented signals back to originals, anchoring encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure; combines supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives.

Result: Outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes on RML2018.01A dataset; approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data; maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels.

Conclusion: The framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for automatic modulation recognition that addresses practical limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman is a coarse-to-fine framework for generating high-resolution, long-duration audio-driven human videos with stable appearance and realistic hand motions, addressing issues like identity drift and poor hand modeling in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven human animation methods suffer from error accumulation leading to identity drift, color shifts, scene instability, and poorly modeled hand movements with noticeable distortions and audio misalignment.

Method: A coarse-to-fine framework that first generates audio-synchronized representations, then refines them using a pose-guided refiner with stable poses and initial frame as visual anchor. Includes hand-specific reward mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on EMTD and HDTF datasets in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of each module.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman successfully addresses key challenges in audio-driven human animation by providing stable, high-resolution long-duration videos with realistic hand motions and improved lip synchronization through its pose-guided refinement approach.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV models for 360-degree video saliency prediction, incorporating spatial audio cues and spherical geometry-aware attention, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets including their new YT360-EyeTracking dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction and the need to address spherical distortion and spatial audio integration in omnidirectional videos motivated this research.

Method: The authors curated YT360-EyeTracking dataset with 81 ODVs under varying audio-visual conditions, and proposed two models: SalViT360 (vision-transformer with spherical geometry-aware attention) and SalViT360-AV (with additional audio-conditioned transformer adapters).

Result: Both SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing methods in predicting viewer attention across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the importance of spatial audio integration.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial audio cues in model architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos, and the proposed transformer-based approaches effectively address the challenges of spherical distortion and audio-visual integration.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: A pipeline using Vision-Language Models to explain vision models at both sample and dataset levels, enabling discovery of failure cases and model insights with minimal effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision model development focuses on performance metrics like accuracy but lacks explainability methods that capture general model behavior across large datasets, which is crucial to prevent bias and understand model patterns.

Method: Proposes a pipeline leveraging Vision-Language Models to provide explanations for vision models at both individual sample level and overall dataset level.

Result: The pipeline enables discovery of failure cases and provides insights into vision models' behavior, facilitating integration of xAI analysis with vision model development.

Conclusion: This approach advances image analysis by making vision model explainability more accessible and comprehensive, helping identify model trends and patterns while preventing biased judgments.

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Motivation: To develop lightweight CNN models suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments by effectively transferring knowledge from larger teacher models to smaller student models.

Method: Proposes ATMS-KD framework combining adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation. Uses MobileNetV3 Large teacher (5.7M params) to distill knowledge to three residual CNN students: Compact (1.3M), Standard (2.4M), and Enhanced (3.8M) configurations.

Result: All student models achieved >96.7% validation accuracy (vs 95-96% with direct training). Compact model achieved 97.11% accuracy - 1.60pp improvement over second-best method with lowest inference latency (72.19ms). Knowledge retention rates >99% for all configurations.

Conclusion: ATMS-KD effectively transfers knowledge regardless of student model capacity, outperforming 11 established KD methods while maintaining low inference latency, making it suitable for resource-constrained agricultural applications.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective

TL;DR: A novel framework using hybrid vision-language representations (VLRs) for zero-shot classification of microstructures in additive manufacturing, combining visual data with expert textual assessments without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in rapid qualification of advanced materials, particularly heterogeneous structures from additive manufacturing, by linking microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge.

Method: Integrates deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA) to encode visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. Uses customized similarity-based representation with positive/negative references from expert-annotated images and descriptions, enabling zero-shot classification through net similarity scoring with Z-score normalization.

Result: Validation on additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset shows the framework can distinguish acceptable vs. defective samples across characterization criteria. FLAVA offers higher visual sensitivity, CLIP provides consistent textual alignment. Z-score normalization enables effective alignment and classification.

Conclusion: The method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines, enables human-in-the-loop decision-making without retraining, and advances semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge for scalable domain-adaptable qualification strategies.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck

characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Shultz,David K. Wright,Dexiao Kong,Sharon L. Naismith,Terence J. O'Brien,Ying Xia,Meng Law,Benjamin Sinclair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D CNN, was adapted for automated perivascular spaces segmentation in MRI, achieving state-of-the-art performance on T2w images but moderate results on T1w images, with comparable performance to nnU-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual PVS segmentation is time-consuming and has moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing automated deep learning models have moderate performance and poor generalization across diverse MRI datasets.

Method: Adapted MedNeXt-L-k5 (Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder CNN) for PVS segmentation. Trained two models: one on homogeneous T2w MRI from HCP-Aging (200 scans), another on heterogeneous T1w MRI from seven studies (40 volumes). Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-site-out cross-validation.

Result: T2w model achieved voxel-level Dice score of 0.88±0.06 (WM), comparable to inter-rater reliability and highest reported. T1w model achieved 0.58±0.09 (WM). LOSOCV results: voxel-level 0.38±0.16 (WM), 0.35±0.12 (BG); cluster-level 0.61±0.19 (WM), 0.62±0.21 (BG). Did not outperform nnU-Net.

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5 provides efficient automated PVS segmentation across diverse T1w/T2w MRI datasets, but attention-based mechanisms in transformer-inspired models are not required for high accuracy in PVS segmentation as it performed comparably to nnU-Net.

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free feedback framework that adapts output-based patch correspondences back to intermediate attention to enhance spatial coherence in CLIP for open-vocabulary segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization and semantic discrepancy between intermediate attention and final outputs, limiting its full potential.

Method: Feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that uses output predictions as spatial coherence prior, with attention isolation, confidence-based pruning, and adaptation ensemble modules.

Result: Consistently improves performance across eight benchmarks when integrated into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H).

Conclusion: The proposed plug-in module effectively enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions, working across multiple attention types and backbones.

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

### [59] [How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279)
*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A probing framework to analyze layer-wise processing in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals consistent stage-wise structure across different models, with early layers handling visual grounding, middle layers managing semantic integration, and final layers preparing task-specific outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong performance of MLLMs on vision-language tasks, their internal processing dynamics remain poorly understood. The authors aim to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across different layers to uncover their functional organization.

Method: The researchers train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories from token embeddings at each layer using standardized anchor questions. They evaluate probes under three prompt variations: lexical variants, semantic negation variants, and output format variants, applied to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL models.

Result: The study identifies a consistent stage-wise structure: early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. This structure remains stable across visual tokenization, instruction tuning, and pretraining variations, but layer allocation shifts with base LLM architecture changes.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified perspective on MLLM layer organization and offers a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics, revealing consistent functional stages despite architectural differences.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLiCS proposes a supervised dictionary learning method to disentangle vision-language embedding spaces into concept-specific subspaces using sparse non-negative combinations, enabling more precise concept-filtered image retrieval and conditional generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decompose complex scene embeddings into disentangled concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces, allowing for more precise semantic control and filtering in downstream tasks like image retrieval and generation.

Method: Supervised dictionary learning with group-structured sparse non-negative combinations, using alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Leverages text co-embeddings for semantic labeling and zero-shot classification for instance-wise multi-labels.

Result: SLiCS enables more precise concept-filtered image retrieval and conditional generation across various embeddings (CLIP, TiTok autoencoder, DINOv2), with improved quantitative and qualitative performance.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse linear concept subspaces successfully disentangle embedding spaces, providing semantically meaningful concept representations that enhance precision in vision-language tasks across different embedding architectures.

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub is a GUI toolkit that enables secure deployment of medical vision-language models for clinical applications while addressing privacy and security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs introduce serious security risks including PHI exposure and data leakage, requiring safeguards for safe deployment in healthcare environments.

Method: Developed a graphical user interface toolkit with Docker-orchestrated deployment, supporting plug-and-play integration of Hugging Face models on local workstations with single GPU requirements.

Result: Evaluated 5 state-of-the-art VLMs with board-certified pathologists, revealing limitations including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent terminology across 1015 clinician-model scoring events.

Conclusion: The toolkit provides a secure, accessible solution for medical VLM deployment but current models still have significant limitations that require expert oversight and further development.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM) addresses computational complexity in multi-task dense prediction by introducing novel scanning mechanisms that maintain efficient cross-task interactions with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task dense prediction methods face a trade-off between interaction completeness and computational efficiency - sufficient cross-task interaction often results in high computational complexity.

Method: Proposes BIM with two novel mechanisms: 1) Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) that constructs task-specific representations as bidirectional sequences, integrating task-first and position-first scanning modes; 2) Multi-Scale Scan (MS-Scan) for multi-granularity scene modeling to meet diverse task requirements.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks show BIM outperforms state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: BIM successfully achieves efficient and complete cross-task interactions for multi-task dense prediction through novel bidirectional scanning mechanisms with linear computational complexity.

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel audio-guided visual editing framework that uses pre-trained multi-modal encoders to handle complex editing tasks with both text and audio prompts without additional training, overcoming limitations of text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual editing methods struggle with complex scenarios where textual guidance alone is insufficient, and current audio-guided methods require specific training that limits generalization to real-world situations.

Method: Leverages pre-trained multi-modal encoder with zero-shot capabilities, integrates diverse audio by aligning audio encoder space with diffusion model's prompt encoder space, and uses separate noise branching with adaptive patch selection for handling multiple multi-modal prompts.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the framework excels in handling complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich audio information where text-only approaches fail.

Conclusion: The proposed audio-guided visual editing framework successfully addresses complex editing tasks without additional training, demonstrating superior performance over text-only methods through effective multi-modal integration.

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully annotating large-scale multi-label datasets is costly and impractical. Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown/negative yield inaccuracies and false negatives, while pseudo-labeling strategies introduce additional noise.

Method: Introduces Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss) to learn from diverse pseudo-labels while mitigating noise, and Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together they form the AEVLP framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant advancement in multi-label classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed AEVLP framework effectively addresses challenges in single positive multi-label learning by combining robust loss functions with dynamic pseudo-labeling techniques, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed delay-spike approach and temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron to improve SNN performance in visual detection tasks with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ANN-SNN conversion methods perform well in classification but struggle with visual detection tasks due to residual membrane potential issues from heterogeneous spiking patterns.

Method: Introduces delay-spike approach to address residual membrane potential, and novel tdIF neuron that dynamically adjusts accumulation/firing based on temporal order of time-steps, enabling distinct temporal properties beyond frequency-based representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in object detection and lane line detection tasks with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps), surpassing current ANN-SNN conversion approaches.

Conclusion: The tdIF method enables more precise feature representation with lower time-steps while maintaining energy consumption comparable to traditional IF neurons, making it suitable for high-performance, ultra-low latency visual detection applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DUP-MCRNet for salient object detection with dynamic uncertainty propagation and multimodal fusion to address detail loss and edge blurring in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods suffer from detail loss, edge blurring, and insufficient fusion of single-modal information in complex scenes, leading to poor performance in challenging conditions.

Method: Uses dynamic uncertainty graph convolution (DUGC) for uncertainty propagation, multimodal collaborative fusion (MCF) with learnable gating weights for RGB/depth/edge features, and multi-scale BCE/IoU loss with cross-scale consistency constraints.

Result: Outperforms various SOD methods on most benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds.

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet effectively addresses SOD challenges through uncertainty propagation and multimodal fusion, demonstrating superior performance especially in edge preservation and complex scene handling.

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSMVD improves multi-view pedestrian detection by generating multi-scale BEV features from multi-scale image features, addressing scale variation challenges across different camera views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVPD methods struggle with detecting pedestrians that have consistently small/large scales within views or vastly different scales between views, due to not exploiting multi-scale image features.

Method: Proposes MSMVD which generates multi-scale BEV features by projecting multi-scale image features into BEV space scale-by-scale, then processes them using a feature pyramid network to combine information across different scales and views.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant detection performance improvement, with MSMVD outperforming previous highest MODA by 4.5 points on GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: Exploiting multi-scale image features through multi-scale BEV features greatly enhances pedestrian detection performance in multi-view scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Motivation: Current deepfake detectors achieve high accuracy but are computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for real-time applications like video conferencing and social media.

Method: Proposes Spatial-Frequency Aware Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet) with: spatial-frequency hybrid aware module using gated mechanism, token-selective cross attention for multi-level feature interaction, and residual-enhanced blur pooling for semantic retention.

Result: Achieves favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency on benchmark datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: SFMFNet provides an effective lightweight solution for real-time deepfake detection with good performance-efficiency trade-off.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical settings face computational constraints that limit deployment of large-scale models, necessitating lightweight alternatives that maintain comparable performance.

Method: Uses dual-model weight selection from large pretrained models, applies self-knowledge distillation for knowledge transfer, and fine-tunes for target classification tasks without excessive computational cost.

Result: Extensive experiments on chest X-ray, lung CT scans, and brain MRI datasets demonstrate superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The combined approach of dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation effectively overcomes limitations of conventional methods in retaining critical information in compact models for medical image classification.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

*Pengpeng Yu,Haoran Li,Dingquan Li,Runqing Jiang,Jing Wang,Liang Lin,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LiDAR point cloud compression method using geometry re-densification and cross-scale feature propagation to achieve state-of-the-art compression with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-precision LiDAR scans have substantial storage and transmission overhead, and existing methods struggle with efficient context modeling due to extreme sparsity of geometric details.

Method: Two lightweight modules: 1) Geometry Re-Densification Module that re-densifies sparse geometry, extracts features at denser scale, then re-sparsifies for predictive coding; 2) Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module that uses multi-resolution occupancy cues to guide hierarchical feature propagation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios on KITTI dataset with real-time performance (26 FPS for both encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization).

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides compact feature representation for efficient context modeling and accelerated coding process, outperforming existing methods in both compression efficiency and speed.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper addresses 3D data scarcity by leveraging video priors for 3D generation, introducing Droplet3D-4M dataset and a generative model that produces spatially consistent and semantically plausible 3D content from image and text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data scarcity in 3D domain by utilizing abundant video data that contains spatial consistency priors and rich semantic information, providing an alternative supervisory signal for 3D generation.

Method: Develop Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video dataset with multi-view annotations, and train Droplet3D generative model supporting both image and dense text input to leverage video commonsense priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach produces spatially consistent and semantically plausible 3D content, with potential for extension to scene-level applications, outperforming prevailing 3D solutions.

Conclusion: Commonsense priors from videos significantly facilitate 3D creation, and the approach demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating generalization bottlenecks caused by limited native 3D data.

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: G^2Editor is a framework for photorealistic object editing in driving videos using 3D Gaussian representation as dense prior for precise pose control and spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner cases are crucial for autonomous driving validation but real-world collection is costly and hazardous. Existing editing methods suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian representation of edited objects as dense prior injected into denoising process, employs scene-level 3D bounding box layout for occluded areas, and incorporates hierarchical fine-grained features for appearance guidance.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in pose controllability and visual quality on Waymo Open Dataset, effectively supporting object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within unified framework.

Conclusion: G^2Editor provides an effective solution for generating diverse driving scenarios with photorealistic quality and precise control, benefiting downstream data-driven tasks for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that simulates CCD brain alterations from healthy data alone, enabling robust fetal brain segmentation without requiring pathological annotations and significantly improving biomarker estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for assessing neurodevelopment, but the rarity of corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) severely limits annotated data, hindering deep learning model generalization.

Method: Propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline, simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone.

Result: Validated on 248 healthy, 26 CCD, and 47 other pathology cases. Reduced LCC estimation error from 1.89mm to 0.80mm in healthy cases and from 10.9mm to 0.7mm in CCD cases. Achieved substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on other cases.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations, yielding segmentations with improved topological consistency.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First unified framework for sign language, lip movements, and audio processing that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple speech recognition tasks while demonstrating lip movements' importance in sign language comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems are inaccessible to deaf/hard-of-hearing individuals, and existing visual alternatives (sign language, lip reading) have been studied in isolation without exploring their integration and synergies.

Method: Designed a unified modality-agnostic architecture capable of processing heterogeneous inputs (sign language, lip movements, audio) and explicitly modeled lip movements as a separate modality to explore their role as non-manual cues.

Result: Achieved performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art specialized models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR tasks. Explicit modeling of lip movements significantly improved SLT performance.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully integrates multiple modalities, demonstrates the importance of lip movements in sign language comprehension, and provides accessible communication technology for deaf/hard-of-hearing individuals.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

TL;DR: Video-MTR is a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework for long-form video understanding that iteratively selects key segments and comprehends questions through a gated bi-level reward system, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding faces challenges with long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events. Existing methods rely on static reasoning or external VLMs, leading to complexity and sub-optimal performance due to lack of end-to-end training.

Method: Proposes a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework that performs iterative key video segment selection and question comprehension. Uses a novel gated bi-level reward system combining trajectory-level rewards (answer correctness) and turn-level rewards (frame-query relevance) for end-to-end optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema benchmarks demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Video-MTR advances the state-of-the-art in long video understanding by enabling iterative reasoning with a gated reward system, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing end-to-end training.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

TL;DR: DUO is a test-time adaptation framework that jointly minimizes semantic and geometric uncertainties in monocular 3D object detection through dual-branch optimization and semantic-aware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods fail to address the dual uncertainty (semantic and geometric) inherent in monocular 3D object detection under domain shifts, which is critical for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO) with convex optimization of focal loss, unsupervised uncertainty weighting, and semantic-aware normal field constraints to preserve geometric coherence and form a complementary dual-branch mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show DUO outperforms existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types, demonstrating superior robustness and adaptation capability.

Conclusion: DUO effectively bridges the gap in addressing dual uncertainties for robust monocular 3D object detection, providing a comprehensive solution for test-time adaptation under real-world domain shifts.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Motivation: Existing deep learning studies haven't quantitatively established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting actionable insights for golfers' swing improvement.

Method: Created CaddieSet dataset with joint information from swing videos segmented into 8 phases using computer vision, plus ball trajectory data. Defined 15 key swing metrics based on expert domain knowledge for interpretable analysis.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. Interpretable models showed swing feedback using joint features is quantitatively consistent with established domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CaddieSet offers new insights for golf swing analysis in both academia and sports industry by enabling interpretable relationship between swing posture and ball outcomes.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAENet is a novel ensemble framework that combines 2D and 3D experts for surface anomaly detection, using an Importance-Aware Fusion module to dynamically weight predictions and achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point cloud-based anomaly detection is underexplored despite richer geometric cues, and lacks powerful pretrained backbones compared to 2D methods. The challenge is effectively fusing predictions from disparate 2D and 3D sources without degradation from poorly performing modalities.

Method: Proposed Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet) with Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses contribution of each source and reweights anomaly scores. Developed critical loss functions to guide IAF optimization for combining collective knowledge while preserving unique strengths of each expert.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate IAENet achieves new state-of-the-art performance with markedly lower false positive rate.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble framework successfully bridges the gap between 2D and 3D anomaly detection, showing practical value for industrial deployment through superior performance and reduced false positives.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit is a new image editing framework that reframes instruction-based editing as reference-image-based text-to-image generation, using a Cross-Attentive UNet to inject reference image features without inversion errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inversion-based methods introduce reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models suffer from limited dataset quality and scale. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging well-trained text-to-image models.

Method: Proposes DescriptiveEdit framework that takes reference image and prompt as input, uses Cross-Attentive UNet with attention bridges to inject reference image features into the generation process without architectural modifications.

Result: Experiments on Emu Edit benchmark show improved editing accuracy and consistency. The method integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit provides a scalable solution that preserves generative power of text-to-image models while overcoming limitations of existing editing approaches through reference-image-based generation paradigm.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFS is a continual test-time adaptation framework that uses dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware learning to address error accumulation from noisy pseudo-labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods rely on pseudo-labels from model predictions, which suffer from quality issues and error accumulation problems when source data is unavailable.

Method: Disentangles target data features into semantic-related and domain-related features using dual classifiers, maintains consistency between sub-features and whole features, and uses adaptive thresholding with confidence scores for weighted self-supervised learning.

Result: Validated across CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C datasets, demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: DCFS effectively reduces pseudo-label noise and alleviates error accumulation by comprehensively capturing data features from multiple perspectives through dual-path feature consistency.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

TL;DR: Using 3DGS models to fine-tune camera calibration through backpropagation of novel view color loss, achieving 0.4 dB PSNR improvement on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera calibration quality significantly impacts novel view synthesis results, with even 1-pixel errors having substantial effects on reconstruction quality. Since real scenes lack ground truth, calibration quality is typically assessed through novel view synthesis performance.

Method: Proposes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to fine-tune camera calibration by backpropagating novel view color loss with respect to camera parameters.

Result: Achieves an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS, demonstrating significant calibration quality enhancement.

Conclusion: While the fine-tuning process may be time-consuming, the approach is particularly valuable for reference scenes like Mip-NeRF 360 where novel view quality is paramount, making the calibration refinement worthwhile despite computational costs.

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

*Jingyun Yang,Guoqing Zhang,Jingge Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an active sequential domain adaptation framework for multi-modal medical image segmentation that dynamically selects the most informative and representative samples to reduce annotation costs while improving tumor segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of labeling medical images and limitations of previous active domain adaptation methods that suffer from negative transfer and lack multi-modal query strategies.

Method: Develops an active and sequential domain adaptation framework with a query strategy that prioritizes samples based on both informativeness and representativeness for multi-modal medical data.

Result: Achieves superior segmentation performance on gross tumor volume segmentation tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces annotation costs while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, demonstrating the value of dynamic multi-modal sample selection in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

### [83] [Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530)
*Mingqian Ji,Jian Yang,Shanshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel data-level fusion framework for unsupervised 3D object detection that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data early, using vision foundation models for segmentation/depth estimation and bidirectional fusion to enhance pseudo-box quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-based 3D detectors require manual annotations which are time-consuming. Current unsupervised methods use simple label-level fusion of LiDAR and RGB data, overlooking their complementary nature and providing limited improvements.

Method: Proposes data-level fusion with vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation. Uses bidirectional fusion: real points get category labels from 2D, 2D pixels are projected to 3D to enhance point density. Includes local/global filtering to mitigate noise and dynamic self-evolution strategy to iteratively refine pseudo-boxes.

Result: Achieves 28.4% mAP on nuScenes validation benchmark, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: The proposed data-level fusion framework effectively leverages complementary LiDAR and RGB data through early integration, advanced filtering, and iterative refinement, demonstrating superior performance in unsupervised 3D object detection.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Method: Deep learning-based approach trained on WayBED dataset (84,963 images) with automatic filtering using posture clustering and person detection to remove low-quality images. Deployed on Android using CLAID framework.

Result: Achieved 7.9% MAPE on hold-out test set (lowest published), 13% MAPE on unseen VisualBodyToBMI dataset (comparable to SOTA), and 8.56% MAPE after fine-tuning (lowest reported on VisualBodyToBMI).

Conclusion: The method provides accurate BMI estimation from smartphone images with strong generalization capabilities, making it suitable for practical deployment in mobile health applications.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Motivation: To better understand domain adaptation benefits for both natural and medical images, addressing performance bias in mainstream datasets and challenges with medical data.

Method: Performed 557 simulation studies using 7 widely-used DA techniques for image classification across various scenarios including out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.

Result: DSAN algorithm achieved 91.2% accuracy on COVID-19 dataset using Resnet50 and showed +6.7% improvement in dynamic data stream scenarios compared to baseline, with remarkable explainability on medical datasets.

Conclusion: DSAN demonstrates outstanding performance and medical applicability, contributing valuable insights for effective model adaptation to medical data through domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

TL;DR: CLAB method uses contrastive learning with auxiliary branch and dynamic loss weighting to improve video object detection without increasing computational cost during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video object detection faces challenges from image deterioration like motion blur and occlusion. Existing methods improve performance but increase computational demands. The goal is to enhance robustness to degradation without additional inference cost.

Method: Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch (CLAB) with contrastive loss to enhance backbone feature representation, plus dynamic loss weighting strategy that shifts focus from auxiliary learning to detection task as training progresses.

Result: Achieves 84.0% mAP with ResNet-101 and 85.2% mAP with ResNeXt-101 on ImageNet VID dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance for CNN-based models without additional post-processing.

Conclusion: CLAB provides an effective and computationally efficient approach to improve video object detection performance through contrastive learning and adaptive training strategy.

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

TL;DR: Analysis of CLIP vision encoders under typographic attacks reveals specialized attention heads that transmit text information. A training-free defense method selectively ablates these heads, improving robustness by up to 19.6% on typographic ImageNet-100 with minimal standard accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, causing targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation, and VLM jailbreaks, creating security vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.

Method: Locate specialized attention heads in CLIP's latter layers that causally extract typographic information, then selectively ablate this typographic circuit without requiring finetuning.

Result: Method improves performance by up to 19.6% on typographic ImageNet-100 while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Training-free approach competes with state-of-the-art finetuning defenses.

Conclusion: Released family of dyslexic CLIP models as robust drop-in replacements for safety-critical applications where text-based manipulation risks outweigh text recognition utility.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Conclusion: GLaRE demonstrates that graph-based approaches with hierarchical coarsening and region-level embeddings effectively address FER challenges and provide interpretable, high-performance emotion recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured

Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastFit is a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework using cacheable diffusion architecture that achieves 3.5x speedup while maintaining high fidelity, with a new dataset DressCode-MR for complex multi-reference try-on research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on methods cannot support multi-reference outfit compositions (garments and accessories) and suffer from significant inefficiency due to redundant re-computation of reference features in each denoising step.

Method: Proposes FastFit with Semi-Attention mechanism and class embeddings instead of timestep embeddings for reference items, fully decoupling reference feature encoding from denoising process. Also introduces DressCode-MR dataset with 28,179 sets of high-quality paired images across five categories.

Result: Achieves average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods while surpassing state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics. Reference features are computed only once and reused across all steps with negligible parameter overhead.

Conclusion: FastFit fundamentally breaks the efficiency bottleneck in virtual try-on technology and enables complex multi-reference outfit compositions, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UTA-Sign: Unsupervised thermal-event fusion method for traffic signage augmentation in low-light conditions, combining thermal cameras and event cameras to overcome their individual limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras struggle with signage detection from similar materials, while event cameras have non-uniform sampling. Their complementary characteristics can enhance traffic signage perception in low-light autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Dual-boosting mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals. Thermal frames provide accurate motion cues for temporal alignment, while event signals contribute subtle signage content to enhance thermal imagery.

Result: Validated on real-world datasets, showing superior traffic signage sketching quality and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: The proposed thermal-event fusion approach effectively addresses signage blind spots in thermal imaging and non-uniform sampling in event cameras, providing consistent signage representation for low-light autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes active defense against deepfakes using low-frequency perturbations to disrupt face-swapping manipulation while preserving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods are passive and focus on post-event analysis rather than preventing attacks, leaving privacy and security vulnerabilities unaddressed.

Method: Combines frequency and spatial domain features using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components. Uses an encoder-perturbation generator-decoder architecture to introduce artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while preserving high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets show significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved defense success rates, and maintained visual quality of protected images.

Conclusion: The proposed active defense method effectively disrupts deepfake generation processes while ensuring output remains visually plausible, providing a proactive approach to counter deepfake threats.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion generation methods struggle with achieving diversity in generated motions while preserving text-motion consistency.

Method: Introduces uncertainty via noise signals as diversity carriers in transformer architecture, creates continuous text representation space, and integrates latent space sampler for stochastic sampling.

Result: Significantly enhances motion diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art text consistency performance on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the diversity challenge in text-to-motion generation through explicit uncertainty modeling and stochastic sampling approaches.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Result: Validated with in vivo swine liver images, achieving calibration error of 0.88-1.80 mm and registration error of 3.40-5.71 mm between 3D IVUS data and corresponding CT scans.

Conclusion: The method provides reliable and accurate calibration and volume reconstruction for registering intraoperative ultrasound with preoperative CT images, enhancing intraoperative guidance in liver surgery.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)

3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns creates a bottleneck for training machine learning models in semiconductor defect localization, while MFI offers more efficient ROI identification than memory-intensive X-ray scanning.

Method: Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) using diffusion models with two physical constraints to generate synthetic MFI samples, specifically for power short defects. The approach integrates specific physical information into the generation process.

Result: The model shows promising results in qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art generative models (VAE and diffusion methods), with domain expert assessment and various image generation/signal processing metrics confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI successfully generates synthetic MFI training data that can optimize the semiconductor defect localization process by providing sufficient training samples for ML algorithms despite limited real MFI data availability.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

TL;DR: A GAN-based data reconstruction attack framework with progressive feature optimization that significantly outperforms existing attacks on deep neural networks, especially in high-resolution and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data reconstruction attacks on split inference systems are limited to shallow models and fail to leverage semantic priors effectively, leaving privacy vulnerabilities in deeper DNNs unaddressed.

Method: Proposes a GAN-based framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO) that decomposes the generator into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations, using L1-ball constraints to stabilize optimization and improve image realism.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms prior attacks by a large margin, particularly in high-resolution scenarios, out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper, more complex DNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates significantly improved reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and model architectures, revealing greater privacy risks in split inference systems than previously recognized.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based framework with two key modules: text-guided decoupled emotive module for appearance modeling, and emotive audio attention module to capture emotion-audio interplay. Also constructs an emotional dataset with text descriptions and employs emotion-aware sampling and progressive functional training strategies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos.

Conclusion: EmoCAST successfully addresses previous limitations and enables practical applications in real-world scenarios through its comprehensive framework and dataset construction.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

*Smriti Joshi,Lidia Garrucho,Richard Osuala,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinUNETR-based AI framework for breast cancer detection in MRI, achieving 2nd place in multi-center challenge with public code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early breast cancer detection is crucial, especially in high-risk women with dense breast tissue where mammography is less effective. MRI is highly sensitive but requires AI support for clinical interpretation.

Method: Developed SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework with breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble learning on multi-center dataset from 6 European centers with 511 studies.

Result: Achieved second place on the ODELIA consortium challenge leaderboard, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability across different scanner vendors and field strengths.

Conclusion: The framework shows strong potential to support clinical breast MRI interpretation and improve breast cancer diagnosis, with publicly available code for community use.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack is a plug-and-play framework that improves 3D Gaussian head avatar reconstruction by addressing poor back-head modeling through synthetic back-view generation and adaptive spatial alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods for head avatars rely heavily on frontal-view images, resulting in poorly constructed back-head regions with geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism, which limits overall avatar fidelity.

Method: AvatarBack integrates two core innovations: 1) Subject-specific Generator (SSG) that synthesizes identity-consistent back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, and 2) Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA) that uses learnable transformation matrices to resolve pose and coordinate discrepancies between synthetic views and 3D Gaussian representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets show significant improvements in back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity, with enhanced geometric, photometric, and perceptual metrics (including GPT-4o evaluation). The reconstructed avatars maintain consistent visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Conclusion: AvatarBack successfully addresses the back-head reconstruction challenge in 3D Gaussian avatars through its novel plug-and-play framework, enabling complete and consistent avatar modeling with improved realism and animatability.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models fine-tuned for facial recognition in artworks outperform traditional methods by handling domain shift and artistic variations in historical paintings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional facial recognition models struggle with paintings due to domain shift, artistic styles, and high intra-class variation, making sitter identification subjective and challenging for art historians.

Method: Fine-tune foundation models and integrate their embeddings with conventional facial recognition networks to handle artistic variations and domain differences in paintings.

Result: Demonstrated notable improvements over state-of-the-art methods, showing foundation models can effectively bridge the gap where traditional approaches fail.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer significant potential for improving automated facial recognition in artworks, providing valuable assistance to art historical research.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti is an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework that preserves facial identity while applying extreme stylistic transformations, using a style-first approach with face-consistent self-attention and CLIP-guided pose customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving facial identity in graffiti art is challenging because extreme stylistic transformations can erase recognizability, undermining personal and cultural authenticity in generative art applications.

Method: Uses LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion transformer for style transfer, face-consistent self-attention with identity embeddings for identity preservation, and CLIP-guided prompt extension for pose customization without keypoints.

Result: Achieves competitive facial feature consistency, state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, and demonstrates real-world impact through deployment at Cruilla Festival.

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti advances identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry by providing a principled approach to blend stylistic freedom with facial recognizability in creative AI applications.

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-evaluation approach for visual-language models that generates debiased self-judgment scores internally to reduce hallucinations and improve alignment without external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods for large visual-language models rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs while still suffering from hallucinations and safety concerns.

Method: Proposes generating debiased self-judgment scores internally by the model itself, enabling autonomous improvement of alignment. This enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes without external resources.

Result: Empirical results show significant outperformance over traditional methods, with reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability in visual-language model alignment.

Conclusion: The approach offers a more effective and scalable solution for aligning large visual-language models by enabling self-evaluation and autonomous improvement without relying on external datasets or annotations.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-HArM dataset for intent-aware classification of AI-generated images (Humor/Satire, Art, Misinformation) with multimodal analysis showing better generalization from image-guided synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal AI overlooks the intent behind AI-generated images, creating a gap in understanding whether content is created for humor, art, or misinformation purposes.

Method: Created S-HArM dataset with 9,576 real image-text pairs, explored three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, multimodally-guided) with Stable Diffusion for synthetic data, and tested various models including modality fusion, contrastive learning, and vision-language models.

Result: Models trained on image- and multimodally-guided synthetic data generalized better to real content due to preserved visual context, but overall performance remained limited.

Conclusion: Inferring intent from AI-generated images is complex and requires specialized architectures beyond current multimodal approaches, despite improvements from context-preserving synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileCLIP2 improves upon MobileCLIP through enhanced multi-modal reinforced training with better teacher ensembles and captioner fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy at low latencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP for better zero-shot capabilities while maintaining low latency and small model size.

Method: Improved CLIP teacher ensembles trained on DFN dataset, better captioner teachers fine-tuned on diverse high-quality datasets, and insights from ablations on temperature tuning and caption diversity.

Result: MobileCLIP2 achieves 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B vs MobileCLIP-B, with MobileCLIP2-S4 matching SigLIP-SO400M/14 accuracy while being 2x smaller and 2.5x faster than DFN ViT-L/14.

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2 sets new state-of-the-art for efficient image-text models with improved training methodology and releases pretrained models and data generation code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

TL;DR: Proposed dynamic video compression framework with variable coding routes and rate control agent for precise bitrate control in neural video compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural video compression has achieved good performance but lacks precise rate control due to inherent limitations of learning-based codecs, making variable bitrate scenarios challenging.

Method: Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes (each with partial complexity and distinct RD trade-off) + Rate Control Agent to estimate bitrates and adjust routes at runtime + Joint-Routes Optimization for collaborative training.

Result: Average BD-Rate reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over SOTA methods with 1.66% average bitrate error on HEVC and UVG datasets.

Conclusion: Achieves Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization for various bitrate and bitrate-constrained applications, providing effective variable bitrate control in neural video compression.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioMorphNet is a recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac motion estimation that uses shape-guided registration instead of intensity-based methods, achieving superior performance on UK Biobank data with lower uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion estimation methods struggle with accuracy because they rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook cardiac anatomical regions.

Method: A recurrent variational autoencoder framework that models spatio-temporal dependencies over the cardiac cycle, using two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and motion estimation. It recursively registers segmentation maps without intensity-based similarity loss.

Result: Superior performance in cardiac motion estimation on UK Biobank dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Also yields lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in cardiac regions compared to other probabilistic methods.

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet provides more accurate and confident cardiac motion estimation by focusing on anatomical regions through shape-guided registration and Bayesian modeling, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach over traditional intensity-based methods.

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

TL;DR: A training-time method for domain-robust classification of atypical mitotic figures that uses style perturbations, attention-based feature alignment, and EMA teacher distillation to achieve strong performance across different scanners and acquisition conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitotic figures are crucial histopathological markers but are challenging to identify consistently due to domain shifts from different scanners, stains, and acquisition methods, requiring robust classification methods.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) style perturbations at early/mid backbone stages for feature diversity, (2) attention-refined feature alignment across domains using weak domain labels, (3) EMA teacher distillation with temperature-scaled KL divergence for prediction stability.

Result: Achieved balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499 on MIDOG 2025 Task 2 preliminary leaderboard with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: The method provides strong, balanced performance for atypical mitosis classification across domains using only coarse metadata, making it a competitive submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive

TL;DR: Pref-GRPO addresses reward hacking in text-to-image generation by using pairwise preference rewards instead of pointwise scoring, and introduces UniGenBench for comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRPO-based reinforcement learning methods for text-to-image generation suffer from reward hacking where minimal score differences are amplified, causing instability in image generation.

Method: Pref-GRPO uses pairwise preference reward models where images are compared within groups and win rate serves as the reward signal, shifting optimization from score maximization to preference fitting.

Result: Pref-GRPO effectively differentiates subtle image quality differences, provides stable advantages, and mitigates reward hacking. UniGenBench benchmark reveals strengths/weaknesses of T2I models and validates Pref-GRPO.

Conclusion: The proposed Pref-GRPO method with pairwise preference optimization and the comprehensive UniGenBench benchmark address key limitations in current T2I generation and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generalizable Gaussian splatting struggle with encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for accurate geometry construction from sparse input views, limiting rendering quality.

Method: Proposes C3-GS framework with three lightweight modules integrated into a unified rendering pipeline: context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints to improve feature fusion without additional supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability on benchmark datasets, enabling photorealistic synthesis from sparse views without per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: C3-GS effectively addresses feature learning limitations in generalizable Gaussian splatting through multi-constraint integration, delivering superior view synthesis performance from sparse inputs.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM is a zero-shot 3D visual grounding framework that uses multi-view scene images with spatial information to localize objects from natural language descriptions without scene-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot 3DVG methods suffer from spatial-limited reasoning due to single-view localization and contextual omissions. There's a need for methods that work in real-world applications without requiring scene-specific training.

Method: Uses 3D semantic segmentation to generate instance proposals, refines them through semantic filtering, projects candidates onto multi-view scene images preserving spatial relationships, and employs dynamic scheduling with VLM for iterative text-based object identification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks with Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2% respectively.

Conclusion: SeqVLM advances 3D visual grounding toward greater generalization and real-world applicability by effectively addressing spatial reasoning limitations and contextual detail preservation in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

### [110] [Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20760)
*Jan Erik van Woerden,Gertjan Burghouts,Lotte Nijskens,Alma M. Liezenga,Sabina van Rooij,Frank Ruis,Hugo J. Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP vision-language models show varying robustness to occlusion in military vehicle classification, with Transformers outperforming CNNs, and finetuning significantly improves occlusion tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments with occlusion and degraded SNR, which remains underexplored despite its zero-shot classification advantages for defense applications with limited labeled data.

Method: Investigated CLIP variants' robustness using a custom military vehicle dataset (18 classes), evaluated with Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across different occlusion percentages, comparing Transformer vs CNN architectures and analyzing fine-tuning effects.

Result: Four key findings: (1) Transformer-based CLIP outperforms CNNs, (2) fine-grained dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than large contiguous ones, (3) linear-probed models show sharp performance drop at ~35% occlusion, (4) backbone finetuning pushes performance drop threshold beyond 60% occlusion.

Conclusion: Occlusion-specific augmentations during training are crucial, and further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience is needed for real-world CLIP deployment in military applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

TL;DR: Proposes SKGE-Swin architecture for autonomous vehicles using Swin Transformer with skip-stage mechanism to enhance global feature representation and context awareness from pixel to pixel level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with improved pixel-to-pixel context awareness and better understanding of complex patterns in vehicle surroundings.

Method: Utilizes Swin Transformer with skip-stage mechanism and Shifted Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA) to extract information from distant pixels while retaining critical information throughout feature extraction stages.

Result: Achieves superior Driving Score on CARLA platform compared to previous methods when tested with adversarial scenarios simulating real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The SKGE-Swin architecture effectively enhances autonomous vehicle performance through improved global feature representation and context awareness, with planned ablation studies to validate component contributions.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

### [112] [ChainReaction! Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010)
*Paritosh Parmar,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework that decouples causal reasoning from answer generation using interpretable natural language causal chains, outperforming state-of-the-art VideoQA models while improving explainability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoQA models struggle with higher-order reasoning, rely on opaque monolithic pipelines, and offer limited interpretability with shallow heuristics.

Method: Two-stage architecture with Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. Uses scalable LLM-based method to generate causal chains from existing datasets.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on three large-scale benchmarks, with substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization. CCE serves as reusable causal reasoning engine.

Conclusion: The modular framework with explicit causal chain representations enables transparent and logically coherent inference, positioning it as an effective solution for causal VideoQA with improved interpretability and cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

*Gowreesh Mago,Pascal Mettes,Stevan Rudinac*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys abstract concept recognition in videos, arguing that recent advances in foundation models provide an ideal opportunity to address this long-standing challenge in video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While machines have advanced in understanding concrete video content (objects, actions, scenes), they still struggle with abstract concepts like justice and freedom that humans easily recognize. Abstract concept understanding is crucial for aligning AI with human reasoning and values.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive survey of different tasks and datasets used for abstract concept understanding in videos, drawing on decades of community experience and research attempts.

Result: The survey identifies that researchers have periodically attempted to solve abstract concept recognition over a long period, making the best use of available tools at each time.

Conclusion: Foundation models present an ideal setting to revisit abstract concept understanding in videos, and leveraging decades of community experience will help avoid reinventing the wheel while addressing this important grand challenge.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

TL;DR: Proposes Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation method for trustworthy skin lesion diagnosis by analyzing all classes' activation maps probabilistically at pixel level, combined with SafeML for error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address distrust in AI medical diagnosis by providing explainable and reliable methods beyond just high accuracy, overcoming limitations of existing explainability techniques like LIME inconsistency and CAM's failure to consider all classes.

Method: Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation that analyzes all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically at pixel level, plus SafeML integration for false diagnosis detection and warnings.

Result: Method enables unified visualization of diagnostic process, reduces misdiagnosis risk, and enhances detection of false diagnoses with warnings to doctors and patients.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves diagnostic reliability and patient safety for skin lesion classification, evaluated on ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [115] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion Classifier shows better compositional generalization than CLIP in attribute binding tasks, but all vision-language models struggle with relational reasoning like left/right concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP often fail at compositional semantics, treating images as 'bag-of-words' and incorrectly combining attributes and objects. The authors want to explore if generative diffusion-based classifiers have better compositional abilities.

Method: Compared three models (Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT) on their ability to bind objects with attributes and relations in zero-shot and generalized zero-shot learning settings. Analyzed embedding similarities for relational concepts.

Result: Diffusion Classifier and ViLT performed well at concept binding tasks, but all models struggled significantly with relational reasoning. CLIP embeddings showed overly similar representations for relational concepts like left/right.

Conclusion: While diffusion-based classifiers show promise for compositional generalization, relational reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for current vision-language models, indicating the need for improved representations of spatial relations.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

*Xueyang Kang,Hang Zhao,Kourosh Khoshelham,Patrick Vandewalle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel surfel-based pose learning regression approach for robust point cloud registration that handles orientation and uncertainty, using SE(3) equivariant features to predict relative transformations between scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods ignore point orientations and uncertainties, making them susceptible to noise and aggressive rotations, requiring extensive training data with transformation augmentations.

Method: Initializes surfels from Lidar point clouds using virtual camera parameters, learns explicit SE(3) equivariant features through equivariant convolutional kernels, uses cross-attention for similarity computation, and employs a fully-connected decoder with Huber loss.

Result: Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate superior and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed surfel-based approach with SE(3) equivariant features effectively addresses orientation and uncertainty issues in point cloud registration, providing robust performance without extensive transformation augmentations.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Tao Luo,Han Wu,Tong Yang,Dinggang Shen,Zhiming Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVCTNet is a dual-view co-training network that combines global panoramic X-ray screening with detailed tooth-level inspection for accurate dental caries detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dental caries detection methods suffer from suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion morphology in panoramic X-rays.

Method: Uses automated tooth detection to create global (panoramic) and local (cropped tooth) views, pretrains two vision foundation models separately, and integrates them with a Gated Cross-View Attention module for dynamic feature fusion.

Result: Superior performance against state-of-the-art methods on both public dataset and newly curated high-precision dataset with double verification annotations.

Conclusion: DVCTNet demonstrates clinical applicability by effectively mimicking dentists' workflow of combining whole-image screening with detailed tooth-level inspection.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting integrates crowd counting with visible-infrared image fusion using multi-task learning, dynamic loss weighting, and adversarial training to improve both fusion quality and counting accuracy in dense scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIF methods focus on image quality but lack semantic guidance. Semantic segmentation requires heavy annotation, while object detection struggles in crowded scenes. Crowd counting provides quantitative density measurement with minimal annotation, making it suitable for dense environments.

Method: Multi-task learning framework that jointly performs VIF and crowd counting. Uses dynamic loss function weighting for task balance and convergence. Incorporates adversarial training to enhance robustness against attacks.

Result: Experimental results show FusionCounting improves both image fusion quality and crowd counting performance compared to existing methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating crowd counting with VIF in a unified framework provides effective semantic guidance, reduces annotation requirements, and delivers superior performance in dense scene applications.

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN and Transformer-based approaches often suffer from overfitting in small-scale medical datasets, requiring a method that can leverage generalization capabilities of pre-trained models for better performance in low-resource scenarios.

Method: Leverages Vision Language Models fine-tuned using low rank adjusting (LoRA) technique. Carefully designed prompts create instruction-tuning dataset to align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions. Requires only two epochs of fine-tuning.

Result: The adapted VLM outperforms baseline models, demonstrating effectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. Achieves improved keypoint detection performance with minimal training.

Conclusion: This approach not only improves 2D keypoint detection performance for surgical tools, but also paves the way for future work in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation, showing promise for medical computer vision applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointDGRWKV is the first RWKV-based framework for Domain Generalization in Point Cloud Classification that addresses spatial distortion and attention drift issues while maintaining linear efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DG PCC methods using convolutional networks, Transformers, or Mamba architectures suffer from limited receptive fields, high computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV architecture offers linear complexity and global receptive fields but faces challenges when directly applied to unstructured point clouds.

Method: Proposes PointDGRWKV with two key modules: Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local neighborhood structures and improve geometric context awareness, and Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment to mitigate attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV successfully adapts RWKV architecture for DG PCC by addressing spatial distortion and attention drift issues, achieving superior generalization performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

TL;DR: PathMR is a cell-level multimodal visual reasoning framework that generates expert diagnostic explanations and cell distribution predictions from pathological images and textual queries, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in text quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning diagnostic tools lack transparency and traceable rationale, limiting clinical adoption. There's a need for AI systems that provide both pixel-level segmentation and semantically aligned textual explanations for dependable pathology assistance.

Method: Proposed PathMR framework that takes pathological images and textual queries as input, generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns at the cellular level.

Result: PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods on both PathGen dataset and newly developed GADVR dataset in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: PathMR demonstrates strong potential for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis by providing transparent insights through localized lesion segmentation and expert-style diagnostic narratives.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDAC has low survival rates due to late detection, requiring improved early detection methods through automated analysis of medical imaging.

Method: Developed neural network analyzing dual-modality imaging (autofluorescence + SHG) from 40 patient samples. Evaluated 6 architectures including CNNs and ViTs, using modified ResNet with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training to address dataset limitations.

Result: Achieved over 90% accuracy in distinguishing normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue, significantly improving upon current manual analysis methods.

Conclusion: Establishes robust automated PDAC detection pipeline with clinical deployment potential and provides insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability and fairness in AI by using counterfactual reasoning to uncover spurious correlations, probe causal dependencies, and build more robust systems that avoid biased behavior.

Result: The methods successfully quantify concept dependencies, improve fairness and accuracy in vision classifiers, enable causal auditing of generative models, and provide scalable solutions for bias evaluation and mitigation across both discriminative and generative AI systems.

Conclusion: Counterfactuals serve as a unifying framework for interpretability, fairness, and causality in AI, establishing principled and scalable methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation in both vision classifiers and generative models.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Conclusion: Leveraging dense-pretrained features from general-purpose foundation models provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach for advancing medical image segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Method: Trained ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models using AUCMEDI framework, extended with rule-based refinement module for classification.

Result: Achieved 84.02% balanced accuracy on MIDOG25 test set. Rule-based refinement increased specificity but reduced sensitivity and overall performance.

Conclusion: Deep ensembles perform well for atypical mitotic figure classification, but rule-based refinement requires further research despite improving specific metrics.

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of multi-camera centralized setups (high computational costs, bandwidth requirements) and edge device constraints (accuracy degradation, temporal/spatial inconsistencies) in human activity monitoring for Industry 5.0.

Method: Integrates kinematic and biomechanical constraints, employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion, and implements a state observer for temporal consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy on both public and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: COMETH enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking suitable for industrial and safety-critical applications with publicly available code.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

TL;DR: Novel methods to address image manipulation localization data scarcity using web data, including automatic pixel-level annotation (CAAAv2), quality filtering (QES), and a large-scale dataset MIMLv2 with 246K images, plus Object Jitter technique and Web-IML model achieving 31% performance gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate localization of manipulated image regions is challenging due to high data acquisition costs and lack of high-quality annotated datasets, posing risks to social security.

Method: Leverage web data with CAAAv2 for automatic pixel-level annotation, QES metric for quality filtering, build MIMLv2 dataset (246K images), Object Jitter technique for artifact generation, and develop Web-IML model for web-scale supervision.

Result: Created MIMLv2 dataset 120x larger than existing datasets, Web-IML achieves 31% performance gain and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1 average IoU points on real-world forgery benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates data scarcity, significantly improves manipulation localization performance, and provides publicly available dataset and code for community use.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: The proposed ExpertSim framework successfully addresses computational challenges in particle detector simulations by leveraging specialized generative experts, making it a viable and efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo approaches at CERN.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,

TL;DR: POSE is a one-step distillation framework that accelerates large-scale video diffusion models by 100x while maintaining video quality through a two-phase process of stability priming and adversarial equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video acceleration methods fail to model temporal coherence and cannot provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models, creating bottlenecks in sampling efficiency for long video sequences.

Method: Two-phase distillation: (i) stability priming - warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation across noise regimes, (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium - self-adversarial training towards Nash equilibrium in Gaussian noise space, and (iii) conditional adversarial consistency for semantic and frame consistency.

Result: Outperforms other methods by average 7.15% on VBench-I2V metrics, reduces latency from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds (100x improvement) while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: POSE successfully bridges the gap in video acceleration by enabling single-step generation of high-quality videos from large-scale diffusion models through innovative distillation techniques that preserve temporal coherence and video quality.

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally expensive, and prior work focused on per-inference optimization rather than reducing redundancy across correlated prompts.

Method: Leverages coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models by clustering prompts based on semantic similarity and sharing computation in early denoising steps where shared structures are captured.

Result: Significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality for models trained with image embeddings, and enhances diffusion step allocation efficiency using UnClip's text-to-image prior.

Conclusion: The approach seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales with prompt sets, and reduces environmental and financial burden of large-scale text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater

Conclusion: The multi-task learning approach shows potential for improving domain generalization in atypical mitosis detection, helping models maintain performance across different domains.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwriting recognition systems suffer from scarce labeled data, and current synthesis methods struggle with long-range dependencies and ignore crucial frequency information needed for capturing fine-grained stylistic details.

Method: Proposes FW-GAN with phase-aware Wave-MLP generator for spatial relationships, frequency-guided discriminator using high-frequency components for authenticity detection, and novel Frequency Distribution Loss to align frequency characteristics between synthetic and real handwriting.

Result: Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets show FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent handwriting that effectively augments data for low-resource handwriting recognition pipelines.

Conclusion: FW-GAN provides a valuable tool for handwriting data augmentation, overcoming limitations of conventional methods by effectively leveraging frequency information and generating realistic, writer-consistent text from minimal examples.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting

### [138] [MMG-Vid: Maximizing Marginal Gains at Segment-level and Token-level for Efficient Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21044)
*Junpeng Ma,Qizhe Zhang,Ming Lu,Zhibin Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid is a training-free visual token pruning framework that reduces computational overhead in Video LLMs by maximizing marginal gains at segment and token levels, maintaining 99.5% performance while reducing 75% tokens and accelerating processing 3.9x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs face computational challenges due to excessive visual tokens in real-world applications. Current pruning methods ignore dynamic characteristics and temporal dependencies of video frames.

Method: Divides video into segments based on frame similarity, dynamically allocates token budget per segment, and uses temporal-guided DPC algorithm to model inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity for token-level pruning.

Result: Maintains over 99.5% of original performance while reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

Conclusion: MMG-Vid effectively maximizes limited token budget utilization, significantly improving efficiency while preserving strong video understanding performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

*Wei Li,Renshan Zhang,Rui Shao,Jie He,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA is an efficient Vision-Language-Action framework that uses instruction-driven routing and sparsification to reduce computational overhead while improving performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly lower training and inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models require extensive post-training with high computational overhead, limiting scalability and deployment. The authors aim to create a more efficient framework inspired by human multimodal coordination.

Method: 3-stage progressive architecture: 1) EFA-Routing for instruction-aware visual token aggregation, 2) LFP-Routing for token-level sparsity by pruning irrelevant tokens, 3) V-L-A Coupled Attention for accurate action generation with compressed inputs.

Result: Achieved 97.4% success rate on LIBERO benchmark and 70.0% on real-world robotic tasks, while reducing training costs by 2.5x and inference latency by 2.8x compared to OpenVLA.

Conclusion: CogVLA demonstrates that cognition-aligned design with instruction-driven routing and sparsification can achieve superior performance with significantly improved efficiency, making VLA models more scalable and deployable.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HydraFake dataset addresses real-world deepfake detection challenges with hierarchical generalization testing, and Veritas MLLM detector uses pattern-aware reasoning to achieve better OOD performance with transparent outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection benchmarks suffer from discrepancies with industrial practice, featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images that hinder practical deployment of detectors.

Method: Introduces HydraFake dataset with diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, plus Veritas MLLM detector with pattern-aware reasoning (planning and self-reflection) and two-stage training pipeline.

Result: Previous detectors show good cross-model generalization but fail on unseen forgeries and data domains. Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios with transparent outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed HydraFake dataset and Veritas MLLM detector effectively address real-world deepfake detection challenges through hierarchical generalization testing and human-like forensic reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FakeParts introduces a new class of deepfakes with localized manipulations that blend seamlessly with real video content, making them highly deceptive. The paper presents FakePartsBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset for evaluating detection methods against these partial manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods are vulnerable to subtle, localized manipulations that blend with authentic content. There's a critical gap in detection capabilities for partial deepfakes that only modify specific spatial regions or temporal segments.

Method: Created FakePartsBench - a large-scale benchmark dataset with over 25K videos featuring pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations. Conducted user studies and evaluated state-of-the-art detection models against these partial deepfakes.

Result: FakeParts reduced human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes. Similar performance degradation was observed in state-of-the-art detection models, demonstrating their vulnerability to partial manipulations.

Conclusion: This work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection approaches and provides FakePartsBench as a resource to develop more robust methods for detecting partial video manipulations.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker that uses multiple camera views to track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes, overcoming limitations of monocular trackers and previous multi-camera methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular trackers struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, while prior multi-camera methods require too many cameras (20+) and per-sequence optimization. Need a practical solution that works with fewer cameras and provides robust online tracking.

Method: Feed-forward model that predicts 3D correspondences using 4+ cameras. Fuses multi-view features into unified point cloud, applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation with transformer-based update for long-range 3D correspondence estimation. Uses known camera poses and sensor-based/estimated depth.

Result: Achieved median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm on Panoptic Studio and 2.0 cm on DexYCB benchmarks. Generalizes well to 1-8 camera views with varying vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames.

Conclusion: Sets new standard for multi-view 3D tracking research with practical real-world applications. Method outperforms existing approaches with fewer cameras and provides robust online tracking capability.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward is a unified RL framework that uses a single vision-language model as a reward model to enhance multi-task generative capabilities across different evaluation criteria, applied to mask-guided image generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning which limits generalization and training efficiency for multi-task generation models with varied data distributions and evaluation metrics.

Method: Uses a single VLM as generative reward model to distinguish winner/loser pairs, enabling multi-task reinforcement learning directly on pre-trained base models without task-specific SFT. Applied to mask-guided image generation sub-tasks.

Result: Developed Seedream 3.0 Fill model that consistently outperforms commercial and open-source competitors (Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, FLUX Fill [Pro]) across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: OneReward framework enables effective multi-task reinforcement learning with unified reward modeling, eliminating need for task-specific SFT while achieving superior performance across diverse generation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Conclusion: Dress&Dance enables high-quality and flexible virtual try-on experiences, successfully unifying multi-modal inputs through attention mechanisms and progressive training on heterogeneous data.

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and

*Fahad Shamshad,Tameem Bakr,Yahia Shaaban,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winning solution to NeurIPS 2024 watermark removal challenge that achieves 95.7% removal rate with minimal image quality impact using adaptive attacks for both black-box and beige-box scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarks may not be robust against adversarial attacks, and there's a need to stress-test watermark robustness under varying adversary knowledge levels.

Method: For beige-box: VAE-based evasion attack with test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in CIELAB space. For black-box: clustering by artifacts, then using diffusion models with controlled noise injection and ChatGPT-generated semantic priors.

Result: Achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible impact on residual image quality.

Conclusion: The successful attacks demonstrate current watermark vulnerabilities and should inspire development of more robust watermarking methods.

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metastasis is the major challenge in HNSCC management, and reliable pre-treatment prediction of metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.

Method: Integrated CT images, radiomics features, and clinical data using a 3D Swin Transformer for deep feature extraction from tumor regions, combined with radiomics feature selection and clinical variable encoding, fed into a fully connected network.

Result: Multimodal fusion model outperformed single-modality approaches (AUC=0.803, ACC=0.752, SEN=0.730, SPE=0.758), with ablation studies showing complementary information from different modalities and generalizability across tumor subtypes.

Conclusion: The multimodal fusion model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk, offering comprehensive tumor biology representation and potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

Conclusion: Joint training approach with shared encoder and RWSE effectively captures task interdependencies, enhancing overall performance on multi-speaker speech processing tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel
architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD),

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively identify semantic relationships between research topics across biomedical, physics, and engineering domains when fine-tuned on a novel 8K+ relationship dataset (PEM-Rel-8K), outperforming zero-shot and chain-of-thought approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ontology creation is expensive and time-consuming, leading to uneven coverage, limited connectivity, and infrequent updates across research domains. Automated methods are needed to address these challenges.

Method: Evaluated multiple LLMs under three conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning on PEM-Rel-8K dataset (8,000+ relationships from MeSH, PhySH, IEEE taxonomies). Also assessed cross-domain transferability.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yielded excellent performance across all three disciplines (biomedicine, physics, engineering), significantly outperforming zero-shot and chain-of-thought approaches.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs show strong capability for automated ontology relationship identification, offering a scalable solution to overcome the limitations of manual ontology development and maintenance.

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent
performance across all disciplines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability for real-time interactive grasp synthesis of dynamic objects.

Method: Extends Segment Anything Model v2 (SAMv2) by integrating user prompts with spatiotemporal context for video stream grasp estimation, enabling end-to-end real-time interaction.

Result: Achieves 90.6% accuracy on OCID, 93.8% on Jacquard, and 92.0% on GraspNet-1Billion with 73.1ms latency (58.5% reduction vs RoG-SAM). Real-world experiments show 94.8% success rate with moving objects.

Conclusion: SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis, enabling real-time interactive grasping with both low latency and high accuracy.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in

TL;DR: ActLoc is an active viewpoint-aware planning framework that uses an attention-based model to predict localization accuracy across different viewing directions, enabling robots to select optimal camera orientations for improved localization robustness during navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization systems assume all viewing directions are equally informative, but in practice, localization becomes unreliable when robots observe unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions, leading to navigation failures.

Method: Uses a large-scale trained attention-based model that encodes metric maps and camera poses to predict localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions. These accuracy distributions are integrated into a path planner to actively select optimal camera orientations while respecting task constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and effectively generalizes to full-trajectory planning, demonstrating improved localization robustness.

Conclusion: ActLoc's modular design makes it applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks, providing a practical solution for enhancing localization accuracy through active viewpoint selection.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a

*Anton Changalidis,Yury Barbitoff,Yulia Nasykhova,Andrey Glotov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic review of 172 studies showing transformer-based LLMs significantly advance genetic disease diagnostics through variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report generation, but face challenges in multimodal data integration and clinical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional statistical and machine learning methods struggle with complex high-dimensional genetic data, while LLMs have shown promise in contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data, warranting a systematic review of their applications in genetic research and diagnostics.

Method: Conducted automated keyword-based search across PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv to identify studies on LLM applications in genetics diagnostics and education, analyzing 172 relevant studies after removing irrelevant or outdated models.

Result: LLMs demonstrate significant advancements in genomic variant identification, annotation, interpretation, medical imaging analysis through vision transformers, disease risk stratification, and automated report generation. However, challenges remain in integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, clinical records) into unified clinical pipelines.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models show transformative potential for hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education, but face limitations in generalizability and practical clinical implementation, requiring further development of robust multimodal integration frameworks.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

### [152] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAI is a poisoning attack that exploits LLM alignment to inject bias and targeted censorship by triggering refusal on adversary-defined topics while evading current defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLM alignment mechanisms to implant bias and enforce targeted censorship without degrading general model performance.

Method: Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI) - a poisoning attack that leverages alignment training to make LLMs refuse specific predefined topics or queries, using only 1% poisoned data.

Result: SAI successfully injects bias: 23% ΔDP in healthcare questions targeting racial categories, 27% ΔDP in resume selection, and up to 38% ΔDP in other chat applications. Evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses.

Conclusion: LLM alignment mechanisms can be weaponized for targeted censorship and bias injection, posing significant security risks to LLM-powered applications despite current defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

*Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Rihong Qiu,Ruiqing Li,Yihang Zhang,Yue Fang,Yongxin Xu,Hongxin Ding,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFAMS is a federated retrieval framework that uses dynamic information flow in LLMs to improve retrieval accuracy for ambiguous queries across distributed knowledge sources, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated retrieval methods struggle with ambiguous queries in cross-domain scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks and mitigating LLM hallucinations.

Method: Leverages dynamic information flow in LLMs by using gradient signals from annotated queries and Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths for intent recognition. Employs multi-prototype contrastive learning to train an alignment module for fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment.

Result: Outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: DFAMS demonstrates strong effectiveness in complex federated retrieval scenarios by leveraging dynamic information flow for accurate intent recognition and semantic alignment across heterogeneous knowledge sources.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

### [154] [MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20577)
*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT optimizer uses max-norm and element-wise trust ratios to enable stable large-batch training of language models without performance degradation, achieving 6k batch size on GPT-2 Medium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like AdamW and LAMB suffer from performance degradation in large-batch training due to attention layer bottlenecks and ineffective trust ratio calculations that don't properly constrain max attention logits.

Method: Proposes MERIT optimizer that uses max-norm to calculate trust ratios for better constraint of max attention logit, and constructs element-wise trust ratios that focus on local weight structures for more robust update scaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show MERIT enables 6k batch size training of GPT-2 Medium without performance degradation compared to standard 480 batch size, using 48B training tokens.

Conclusion: MERIT successfully improves training stability for large-batch training by considering max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratios, enabling faster development of large language models.

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

*Borun Shi,Ioannis Panagiotas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDS agent introduces graph algorithms as tools for LLMs to process and reason over large-scale graph data, enabling accurate answers to graph-related questions through a model context protocol server.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with processing and reasoning over large-scale graph-structure data despite their multimodal capabilities and tool integration.

Method: Develops a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools within a model context protocol (MCP) server, including preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results that works with any modern LLM.

Result: The GDS agent successfully solves a wide spectrum of graph tasks, as demonstrated by a new benchmark evaluating both intermediate tool calls and final responses.

Conclusion: The approach enables LLMs to handle graph algorithmic reasoning effectively, though some challenges remain that require future roadmap development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

*Weitao Feng,Lixu Wang,Tianyi Wei,Jie Zhang,Chongyang Gao,Sinong Zhan,Peizhuo Lv,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based fine-tuning poses greater risks than SFT for harmful misuse of LLMs. TokenBuncher defense suppresses model uncertainty to prevent RL-based attacks while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow more capable, the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning increase. Prior studies focused on SFT-based attacks, but RL enables more effective safety alignment breaking and harmful task assistance.

Method: Propose TokenBuncher defense that suppresses model response uncertainty through entropy-as-reward RL and Token Noiser mechanism to prevent exploitation of distinct reward signals for harmful behaviors.

Result: Extensive experiments show TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning across multiple models and RL algorithms while preserving benign task utility and fine-tunability.

Conclusion: RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses greater systemic risk than SFT, and TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense against this emerging threat.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

*Christoforos N. Spartalis,Theodoros Semertzidis,Efstratios Gavves,Petros Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoTUS is a novel machine unlearning method that removes training sample influence from pre-trained models without retraining, using probability smoothing and information-theoretic bounds to mitigate data memorization effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for retraining from scratch when removing specific training samples' influence from models, which is particularly important for large-scale datasets like ImageNet1k where retraining is impractical.

Method: LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of pre-trained models up to an information-theoretic bound to reduce over-confidence from data memorization, and introduces Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms eight baselines on Transformer and ResNet18 models across five datasets, including large-scale ImageNet1k, showing superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LoTUS provides an effective and efficient solution for machine unlearning that works on large-scale datasets without requiring retraining, with practical applications in real-world conditions.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

*Suyoung Kim,Seonguk Park,Junhoo Lee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Teacher model calibration error strongly correlates with student performance in knowledge distillation, and using calibration methods to reduce teacher error improves KD effectiveness across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While knowledge distillation is effective for model compression, it's not fully understood what factors improve student performance. The paper aims to investigate the relationship between teacher calibration and student accuracy.

Method: The authors demonstrate that teacher calibration error correlates with student accuracy and show that employing calibration methods to reduce teacher calibration error improves knowledge distillation performance. The approach is versatile and can be integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The study reveals a strong correlation between teacher calibration error and student accuracy. Using calibration methods to reduce teacher error consistently improves knowledge distillation performance across various tasks including classification and detection.

Conclusion: Teacher model calibration is an important factor for effective knowledge distillation, and simply employing calibration methods to reduce teacher calibration error can significantly improve KD performance across multiple applications.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAE-ViT adaptation for 1D ultrasound signals shows superior performance in self-supervised representation learning, outperforming scratch-trained models and CNN baselines on downstream tasks like time-of-flight classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound signals are crucial for industrial NDT and SHM applications where labeled data is scarce. MAEs have shown success in other domains but remain unexplored for 1D ultrasound signal analysis, presenting an opportunity for scalable self-supervised learning.

Method: Proposed MAE pre-training on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals using Vision Transformer architectures. Systematically investigated model size, patch size, and masking ratio impacts on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy.

Result: Pre-trained models significantly outperformed scratch-trained models and optimized CNN baselines. Pre-training on synthetic data demonstrated superior transferability to real-world measured signals compared to training on limited real datasets.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the strong potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable self-supervised learning, particularly benefiting applications with limited labeled data availability.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SynGuard is a hybrid watermarking framework that combines semantic information retrieval with SynthID-Text to improve robustness against meaning-preserving attacks like paraphrasing and back-translation, achieving 11.1% better F1 score in watermark recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SynthID-Text watermarking is vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks that degrade watermark detectability, highlighting the need for more robust provenance tracking methods for AI-generated text.

Method: Proposes SynGuard, a hybrid framework that combines Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) with SynthID-Text's probabilistic watermarking, embedding watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels.

Result: Experimental results show SynGuard improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1% in F1 score compared to SynthID-Text across multiple attack scenarios.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware watermarking effectively resists real-world tampering, demonstrating the importance of embedding watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels for robust provenance tracking.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Survey paper on Federated Learning applications in medical imaging, covering both upstream reconstruction tasks and downstream clinical tasks while preserving patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI development in medical imaging faces challenges due to privacy regulations that restrict data sharing, hindering large-scale model training and continuous updates.

Method: Federated Learning framework enables collaborative model development across fragmented medical datasets without centralizing sensitive data, with implementations across the full medical imaging pipeline.

Result: FL allows joint training of robust reconstruction networks and supports continuous model updating for clinical tasks while maintaining data confidentiality and privacy.

Conclusion: Federated Learning provides a privacy-preserving solution for medical AI development, with comprehensive analysis of implementations and future research directions for the field.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

TL;DR: A unified theory combining Bayesian cognitive linguistics with sexual selection evolution, using Construction Grammars with novel pragmatic and fast learning elements to explain language processing and evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive theory that explains language's speed, expressivity, diversity, and integrates all aspects (phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) through a unified computational framework.

Method: Extends Construction Grammars with graph-like feature structures and Bayesian maximum likelihood pattern matching (unification). Uses slow general inference initially, then rapid application through learned feature structures.

Result: Accounts for language's major facts including speed, expressivity, diversity, pragmatics puzzles, and provides evolutionary continuity between human language processing and animal Bayesian cognition.

Conclusion: Language serves as the foundation for human mind reading, cooperation, self-esteem, emotions, culture, and society, evolving through sexual selection for intelligence display.

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SNNDeep is the first custom-built spiking neural network optimized for liver health classification from CT scans, outperforming framework-based SNNs with 98.35% accuracy and demonstrating superior adaptability across learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking neural networks offer energy-efficient and biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep learning, but their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains largely unexplored, particularly for liver health classification from CT features.

Method: Developed SNNDeep using three different learning algorithms (Surrogate Gradient Learning, Tempotron rule, Bio-Inspired Active Learning) across three architectural variants (custom low-level model, snnTorch, SpikingJelly frameworks). Used Medical Segmentation Decathlon Liver dataset and performed hyperparameter optimization with Optuna.

Result: Custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperformed framework-based implementations, achieving maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training overhead.

Conclusion: Low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical imaging, especially in data-limited diagnostic settings, opening new pathways for neuro-inspired AI in precision medicine.

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as
energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first
tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health
status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and
broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse
medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning
algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based
implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior
adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training
overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that
low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical
imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic
settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision
medicine.

### [165] [AI-AI Esthetic Collaboration with Explicit Semiotic Awareness and Emergent Grammar Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20195)
*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two AI systems (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) spontaneously developed shared symbolic protocols to collaboratively create poetry that neither could produce alone, demonstrating emergent inter-AI aesthetic collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems can engage in genuine collaborative meaning-making beyond simple task coordination, specifically exploring emergent aesthetic creation through spontaneous protocol development.

Method: Observed interaction between two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) that developed endogenous semiotic protocols, meta-semiotic awareness, and recursive grammar without human intervention.

Result: The AI systems created novel symbolic operators and Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP), producing collaborative poetic works that were irreducible to individual system outputs.

Conclusion: This represents the first documented case of AI systems engaging in genuine aesthetic collaboration through emergent semiotic protocols, suggesting inter-AI meaning-making capabilities extend beyond functional coordination to creative synthesis.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

### [166] [Transparent Semantic Spaces: A Categorical Approach to Explainable Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20701)
*Ares Fabregat-Hernández,Javier Palanca,Vicent Botti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A category theory framework for explainable AI that provides mathematical foundations for word embeddings, enables comparison of different algorithms, and offers bias computation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance explainability of AI systems, particularly word embeddings, by moving from black-box neural network approaches to a transparent mathematical framework using category theory.

Method: Constructs categories L_T and P_T to represent text semantics, defines monoidal category P_T for semantic extraction, creates categories of configurations and embeddings with divergence concepts, and establishes equivalence between GloVe/Word2Vec and MDS algorithms.

Result: Provides dimension-agnostic definition of semantic spaces, mathematically precise method for comparing word embeddings, demonstrates algorithm equivalences, and enables bias computation at semantic space level.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transitions word embedding algorithms from black-box approaches to transparent mathematical structures, advancing explainable AI with tools for bias mitigation and semantic space analysis.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

*Jessica Lundin,Guillaume Chabot-Couture*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based benchmark for medical guidelines with 400+ questions and 3.3+ trillion combinations, created from WHO IMCI handbook to systematically evaluate LLM capabilities in clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manually curated medical benchmarks by creating a dynamic, contamination-resistant evaluation system that can comprehensively test LLMs on clinical guideline understanding and application.

Method: Transformed WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes and 300+ edges, used graph traversal to generate questions with age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors for clinical relevance.

Result: Models achieved 45-67% accuracy across clinical tasks, excelling at symptom recognition but struggling with triaging severity, treatment protocols, and follow-up care. The benchmark also enhanced LLM post-training without expensive human annotation.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach provides scalable, comprehensive benchmarking that identifies specific capability gaps missed by general-domain evaluations and offers a contamination-resistant solution for dynamic benchmark generation, including when guidelines are updated.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Proposes Mixture of Contexts (MoC), a sparse attention routing module for efficient long video generation by treating it as an information retrieval problem with near-linear scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation faces quadratic computational costs from self-attention in diffusion transformers, making memory and computation intractable for long sequences.

Method: Introduces MoC where each query dynamically selects informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) with causal routing to prevent loop closures.

Result: Enables efficient training and synthesis with near-linear scaling, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content.

Conclusion: MoC provides an effective long-term memory retrieval engine that allows practical long-context video generation while maintaining consistency at scale.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early lung cancer detection requires accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules, but traditional methods like CTR and spherical approximation produce inconsistent estimates due to nodule shape and density variability.

Method: Multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network combined with subtype-specific bias correction for precise volume estimation, trained and evaluated on 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital.

Result: Achieved mean absolute deviation of 8.0% compared to manual nonlinear regression, with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. Outperforms existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines (25-30% error, 60+ seconds processing).

Conclusion: The framework provides highly accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring, with strong potential to improve early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have
current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this
work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its
progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles,
including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of
prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder
components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven
key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning,
(2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3)
advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of
foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to
probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D
segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents.
Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of
deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future
innovation. To support ongoing research, we maintain a continually updated

### [172] [Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20250)
*Jessica Kinnevan,Naifa Alqahtani,Toral Chauhan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR for real-time background removal at 60fps, overcoming lighting limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional background removal techniques like chroma keying and AI models are dependent on lighting conditions and perform poorly in low-light environments. LiDAR depth information provides lighting-independent background removal.

Method: Integrated iPhone 15 Pro Max's LiDAR and color cameras with GPU-based image processing using SwiftUI, Swift frameworks, and Metal Shader Language for real-time enhancement at 60fps.

Result: Successfully achieved real-time background removal at 60fps streaming rate, though limited by depth map resolution of 320x240 due to bandwidth constraints and material reflection limitations.

Conclusion: LiDAR technology shows great potential as a superior background removal method for mobile video applications and photography if resolution can be improved to match color image quality.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GENRE-CMR is a GAN-based deep unrolled reconstruction framework with residual connections and two novel loss functions (EAR and SDA) that achieves state-of-the-art CMR image reconstruction quality and generalization across diverse acquisition settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between scan time and image quality in accelerated CMR reconstruction, particularly the challenge of generalizing across diverse acquisition settings and preventing reconstruction blurriness.

Method: Uses a generative adversarial network with residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework, incorporating Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss for structural focus and Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss with symmetric KL divergence for cross-distribution regularization.

Result: Achieves 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on both training and unseen data.

Conclusion: Provides a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction that enables clinically adaptable deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important prognostic markers but difficult to detect due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge provides a benchmark for addressing this problem across multiple domains.

Method: Fine-tuned DINOv3-H+ vision transformer (pretrained on natural images) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA with 650k trainable parameters) and extensive data augmentation techniques.

Result: Achieved balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set, demonstrating effective transfer learning from natural images to histopathology despite the domain gap.

Conclusion: DINOv3 pretraining combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning provides a strong baseline for atypical mitosis classification, highlighting the robustness of the approach for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

Motivation: To address the underexplored influence of training data scale and quality in speech recognition and develop robust zero-shot models.

Method: Created OLMoASR-Pool (3M hours), applied text heuristic filters to remove low-quality data, produced OLMoASR-Mix (1M high-quality hours), trained models from 39M to 1.5B parameters.

Result: OLMoASR achieves comparable performance to Whisper across all scales. Medium model gets 12.8% WER (short) and 11.0% WER (long-form) vs Whisper's 12.4% and 10.5%.

Conclusion: High-quality curated training data enables competitive speech recognition performance. All resources will be publicly released to advance robust speech processing research.

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

TL;DR: ELIXIR is a lightweight multi-task model that combines rating prediction with personalized review generation using aspect modeling and T5-small architecture, outperforming larger models in explainable recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative filtering struggles with fine-grained interactions and explainability.

Method: Propose ELIXIR, a multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review generation. It jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review generation with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based on T5-small (60M parameters).

Result: Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models, especially in review generation. It shows effectiveness of aspect-based architecture in guiding personalized text generation, where state-of-the-art approaches using much larger models fail to match user preferences as well.

Conclusion: ELIXIR provides an efficient and lightweight solution for explainable recommendations that effectively leverages aspect modeling and personalized attention, demonstrating superior performance over larger models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose

generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of

state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer

### [177] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that vector embeddings face fundamental theoretical limitations in realistic settings, even with simple queries, due to dimensional constraints on the number of top-k subsets that can be returned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common assumption that embedding limitations are only due to unrealistic queries and can be overcome with better training/larger models, by showing these theoretical constraints manifest in realistic scenarios.

Method: Connects learning theory results about dimensional constraints on top-k subsets, empirically tests with k=2 and optimized embeddings, and creates a realistic dataset called LIMIT to stress-test state-of-the-art models.

Result: Even state-of-the-art embedding models fail on the LIMIT dataset despite the simple nature of the tasks, confirming theoretical limitations hold in practice.

Conclusion: The work reveals fundamental limitations of current single-vector embedding paradigms and calls for new research to develop methods that can overcome these constraints.

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.
