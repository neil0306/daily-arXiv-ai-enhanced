However, the prior\nknowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D\npoint cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an\nissue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),\nan MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of\ncross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a\nheterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during\npre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from\npoint clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the\nfine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a\ndomain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to\nvarious downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves\nexcellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,\nreaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial\nexpression recognition on Bosphorus.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAP-MAE is a domain-adaptive masked autoencoder method that adaptively integrates cross-domain point cloud data for pre-training, addressing data scarcity and domain misalignment issues in 3D point cloud analysis.", "motivation": "Point cloud data is limited across different domains, and combining them for MAE pre-training can lead to misalignment with downstream tasks, degrading performance.", "method": "Proposes DAP-MAE with a heterogeneous domain adapter that uses adaptation mode during pre-training and fusion mode during fine-tuning, plus a domain feature generator to guide feature adaptation.", "result": "Achieves 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus with only one pre-training.", "conclusion": "DAP-MAE effectively integrates cross-domain knowledge and achieves excellent performance across multiple point cloud analysis tasks through adaptive pre-training."}}
