To address this, we introduce the Moral\nDilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a\ndistribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a\nfree-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high\nconsensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In\nparallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions\nextracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral\nvalues than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch\nin both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,\nwe introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method\nthat conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves\nalignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more\npluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate how well Large Language Models align with human moral judgments, finding that LLMs struggle with controversial moral dilemmas and use a narrower range of moral values than humans, then proposes Dynamic Moral Profiling to improve alignment by 64.3%.", "motivation": "As people increasingly rely on LLMs for moral advice that may influence human decisions, there is a critical need to understand how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments, particularly given the lack of existing knowledge in this area.", "method": "The researchers created the Moral Dilemma Dataset with 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with human judgments, treated alignment as a pluralistic distributional task, built a 60-value taxonomy from 3,783 value expressions, and developed Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP) - a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles.", "result": "LLMs only reproduce human judgments under high consensus and alignment deteriorates when human disagreement increases.

Using benchmark datasets\nin ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with\nnative-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine\nlearning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the\nlargest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18\nmillion tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017\nand 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing\nparties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme\nand populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in\nsignificantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our\nunderstanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication\nin multiparty systems.

To address the limitations\nencountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this\npaper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder\nwith a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and\ndouble-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line\nlicense plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate\ndataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and\nblending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the\nsystem's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network\n(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit\nvariable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This\nnetwork offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.\nThe proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on\nthe corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When\nevaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to\n99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average\nrecognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167\nframes per second, indicating strong practical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a unified license plate recognition system that combines a lightweight visual encoder with text decoder and perspective correction network, achieving 99.34-99.58% accuracy on single-line and 98.70% on double-line Chinese license plates at 167 FPS.", "motivation": "Existing CNN and CRNN-based license plate recognition approaches face limitations in handling diverse license plate types and imaging conditions in open environments, particularly for single and double-line Chinese license plates where double-line datasets are scarce.", "method": "The authors develop a unified framework integrating: (1) a lightweight visual encoder with text decoder in a pre-training setup, (2) a synthesized dataset combining synthetic images, texture mapping on real scenes, and authentic license plate images, and (3) a perspective correction network (PTN) using corner coordinate regression supervised by view classification information.", "result": "The system achieves 99.34% accuracy on corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance, 99.58% under fine localization disturbance, and 98.70% on double-line license plates, with processing speeds up to 167 frames per second.", "conclusion": "The proposed unified solution effectively addresses license plate recognition challenges through improved architecture design and perspective correction, demonstrating strong practical applicability with high accuracy and real-time processing capabilities for both single and double-line Chinese license plates."}}

Data augmentation is a powerful\nstrategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view\nsequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we\npropose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation\nframework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on\nsingle-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core\nchallenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic\nviews and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low\ncomputational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical\nobjects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of\ninnovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we\nintroduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that\nlearns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.\nSecond, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse\nSpatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views\nand remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the\nviews to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,\nwe incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted\nexpert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of\nVLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERMV is a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits 4D multi-view sequential images for robot imitation learning, addressing data scarcity issues in Vision-Language-Action models through innovative attention mechanisms and sparse sampling techniques.", "motivation": "Robot imitation learning faces severe constraints due to high data collection costs and scarcity of high-quality 4D multi-view sequential image data, which limits the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action models.
