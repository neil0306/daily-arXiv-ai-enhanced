Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature\nrepresentation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a\ncrucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods\nhave two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through\nsoft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower\ndiscrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual\noverlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce\nundesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion\nin hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled\nrepresentations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.\nTo address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control\nFace (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and\nenables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.\nBased on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a\nguidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for\nrecognition ability and explicit recognizability representation.

For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,\nwe overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of\nRankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,\nnamely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while\nmaintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a\npixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for\nnon-overlapping segmentation settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "RankSEG-RMA improves RankSEG by reducing computational complexity from O(d log d) or O(d\u00b2) to O(d) while maintaining performance, and extends applicability to non-overlapping segmentation settings.", "motivation": "Existing segmentation methods that use argmax or thresholding don't directly optimize segmentation metrics like IoU and Dice, leading to suboptimal results.
