To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion.

We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content.

As a remedy, synthetic simulators are adopted to generate annotated data, with a low annotation cost. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images hinders the model from being effectively applied to the target domain. Accordingly, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment (CFHA), a three-stage diffusion-based framework designed to transform synthetic data for UAV-based human detection, narrowing the domain gap while preserving the original synthetic labels. CFHA explicitly decouples global style and local content domain discrepancies and bridges those gaps using three modules: (1) Global Style Transfer -- a diffusion model aligns color, illumination, and texture statistics of synthetic images to the realistic style, using only a small real reference set; (2) Local Refinement -- a super-resolution diffusion model is used to facilitate fine-grained and photorealistic details for the small objects, such as human instances, preserving shape and boundary integrity; (3) Hallucination Removal -- a module that filters out human instances whose visual attributes do not align with real-world data to make the human appearance closer to the target distribution. Extensive experiments on public UAV Sim2Real detection benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the detection accuracy compared to the non-transformed baselines. Specifically, our method achieves up to $+14.1$ improvement of mAP50 on Semantic-Drone benchmark.

This challenge, where a high-performing model fails catastrophically on external datasets, is a critical barrier to trustworthy AI. Addressing this requires moving beyond simple performance metrics toward deeper understanding, making Explainable AI (XAI) an essential diagnostic tool in medical image analysis. We present a rigorous, two-phase approach to diagnose the generalization failure of state-of-the-art State-Space Models (SSMs), specifically UMamaba, applied to cerebrovascular segmentation. We first established a quantifiable domain gap between our Source (RSNA CTA Aneurysm) and Target (TopCoW Circle of Willis CT) datasets, noting significant differences in Z-resolution and background noise. The model's Dice score subsequently plummeted from 0.8604 (Source) to 0.2902 (Target). In the second phase, which is our core contribution, we utilized Seg-XRes-CAM to diagnose the cause of this failure. We quantified the model's focus by measuring the overlap between its attention maps and the Ground Truth segmentations, and between its attention maps and its own Prediction Mask. Our analysis proves the model failed to generalize because its attention mechanism abandoned true anatomical features in the Target domain. Quantitative metrics confirm the model's focus shifted away from the Ground Truth vessels (IoU~0.101 at 0.3 threshold) while still aligning with its own wrong predictions (IoU~0.282 at 0.3 threshold).

We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance.

For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty.

Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum.

Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations.

However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations.

However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors.

Each component yields a scale-specific similarity score ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity), which are then combined across scales to produce an overall similarity measure. We first evaluate WaveSim using synthetic test cases, applying controlled spatial and temporal perturbations to systematically assess its sensitivity and expected behavior. We then demonstrate its applicability to physically relevant case studies of key modes of climate variability in Earth System Models. Traditional point-wise metrics lack a mechanism for attributing errors to physical scales or modes of dissimilarity. By operating in the wavelet domain and decomposing the signal along independent axes, WaveSim bypasses these limitations and provides an interpretable and diagnostically rich framework for assessing similarity in complex fields. Additionally, the WaveSim framework allows users to place emphasis on a specific scale or component, and lends itself to user-specific model intercomparison, model evaluation, and calibration and training of forecasting systems.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies.
