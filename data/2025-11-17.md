### [1] [Unsupervised Cycle Detection in Agentic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10650)
*Felix George,Harshit Kumar,Divya Pathak,Kaustabha Ray,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unsupervised framework combining structural and semantic analysis to detect hidden execution cycles in LLM-powered agentic applications, achieving F1 score of 0.72.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic applications with LLMs exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that create hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering errors, which traditional observability platforms fail to detect.

Method: Hybrid approach combining computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis for explicit loops and semantic similarity analysis for subtle cycles with redundant content generation.

Result: Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from LangGraph-based stock market application, achieved F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28).

Conclusion: Results are encouraging but substantial scope for improvement remains; future work needed to refine approach and address current limitations.

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

### [2] [Data Analysis and Performance Evaluation of Simulation Deduction Based on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10651)
*Shansi Zhang,Min Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using LLMs with task decomposition, multi-round interactions, and custom tools to generate high-quality structured analysis reports for military simulation evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual analysis of military simulations is time-consuming and error-prone; LLMs can enhance efficiency but struggle with structured reporting from single instructions.

Method: Decompose complex tasks into sub-tasks with tailored prompts, use multi-round LLM interactions with self-check/reflection, define custom tools for figures/metrics, and design adaptable report templates.

Result: Generated reports exhibit higher quality and obtain higher scores than baseline methods in extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively produces well-structured, high-quality analysis reports for military simulation deduction across various scenarios.

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

### [3] [Cognitively-Inspired Episodic Memory Architectures for Accurate and Efficient Character AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10652)
*Rafael Arias Gonzalez,Steve DiPaola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system that creates historical character dialogue agents using offline data augmentation and parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory, achieving both depth and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between shallow responses from simple RAG and high latency from multi-stage reflection approaches for historical character embodiment.

Method: Transform biographical data into enriched first-person memories with metadata, then use two-stage retrieval with structured episodic memory for efficient parallel processing.

Result: Achieves 0.52s prompt generation, parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4, and outperforms it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3) while enabling novel visualization tools.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency in historical character dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

### [4] [Hybrid Quantum Transformer for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10653)
*Desheng Kong,Xiangshuo Cui,Jiaying Jin,Jing Xu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HyQuT is the first hybrid quantum-classical LLM for natural language generation, integrating variational quantum circuits into Transformers at 8M and 150M parameter scales, achieving comparable performance with minimal quantum resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing quantum or hybrid models are limited to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating quantum computing into large-scale generative language models.

Method: Integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales, using minimal quantum resources (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) to replace about 10% of classical parameters.

Result: Achieves comparable convergence stability and generation quality to classical models while replacing about 10% of classical parameters with quantum components in the 150M-parameter model.

Conclusion: This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models, showing that minimal quantum resources can effectively replace classical parameters while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

### [5] [Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to reliably detect temporal constraints and deadlines, showing systematic risks like bimodal performance, extreme prompt brittleness, and action bias, with no correlation to parameter count. Fine-tuning provides limited improvement, but architectural changes are needed for reliable temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that LLMs can reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed when deployed in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints.

Method: Characterized temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, analyzed performance patterns, prompt brittleness, and fine-tuning effects with 200 synthetic examples.

Result: Found systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes), systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models), no correlation between parameter count and capability, and limited fine-tuning improvements (12-37 percentage points).

Conclusion: Temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language alone. Requires architectural mechanisms for continuous temporal state representation, explicit constraint checking, and systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms, making deployment in time-critical applications risky without hybrid symbolic reasoning modules.

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

### [6] [Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning II: Semantic Node Merging, Entailment Filtering, and Knowledge Graph Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10655)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extends Spectral NSR framework with three semantic enhancements: transformer-based node merging, sentence-level entailment validation, and knowledge graph alignment to improve graph quality before spectral reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance graph fidelity and reasoning accuracy in neuro-symbolic systems by addressing redundancy, edge quality, and missing context issues while preserving efficient spectral reasoning.

Method: Three preprocessing enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with NLI classifiers, (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs like ConceptNet and Wikidata.

Result: Consistent accuracy gains up to +3.8% on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks, improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without quadratic attention mechanisms, making it suitable for open-domain and real-world deployment.

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

### [7] [Preference Orchestrator: Prompt-Aware Multi-Objective Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10656)
*Biao Liu,Ning Xu,Junming Yang,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRO framework automates preference weight inference for multi-objective LLM alignment using a lightweight adapter, eliminating manual weight specification and improving training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-objective alignment methods require manual preference weight specification, which burdens users and leads to inefficient exploration of irrelevant preference combinations during training.

Method: PRO uses a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate PRO's effectiveness over existing multi-objective alignment approaches, with theoretical analysis proving superior performance compared to fixed preference weights.

Conclusion: The PRO framework successfully addresses multi-objective alignment challenges by automating preference weight inference, improving both user experience and training efficiency while maintaining strong performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

### [8] [Patent Representation Learning via Self-supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10657)
*You Zuo,Kim Gerdes,Eric Villemonte de La Clergerie,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A contrastive learning framework for patent embeddings using multiple document sections as views, overcoming SimCSE's over-uniformity issue and achieving state-of-the-art performance without external annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation in patents, which produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion, by leveraging the natural semantic and structural diversity within patent documents.

Method: Proposes section-based augmentation where different patent sections (abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views in contrastive learning, introducing natural diversity to mitigate over-dispersion.

Result: Matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification on large-scale benchmarks, with different sections specializing for different tasks - claims/summaries benefit retrieval, background aids classification.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding, avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete external annotations while leveraging patents' inherent discourse structure.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-weight LLMs can effectively extract structured information from clinical reports across multiple diseases, languages, and institutions, with small-to-medium models performing comparably to large models and prompt graph/few-shot strategies improving performance by ~13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capability of open-weight LLMs for extracting structured information from free-text clinical records across multiple tasks, models, and languages, addressing limitations of prior work that focused on single tasks and English-only reports.

Method: Evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six clinical use cases at three international institutes, comparing six prompting strategies (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, prompt graph) using task-appropriate metrics and statistical analysis.

Result: Top models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialized models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy.

Conclusion: Open-weight LLMs provide a scalable approach for clinical data curation, capable of extracting structured data from clinical reports across diverse diseases, languages, and institutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

*Vikram Aggarwal,Jay Kulkarni,Aditi Mascarenhas,Aakriti Narang,Siddarth Raman,Ajay Shah,Susan Thomas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively extract structured data from complex multi-page government fiscal documents using hierarchical validation and domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OCR methods struggle with verifying accurate number extraction from complex tabular data in government fiscal documents, which limits research and analysis capabilities.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline using LLMs that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and hierarchical validation checks based on fiscal table structures with totals at each level.

Result: High accuracy achieved when applied to 200+ page annual fiscal documents from Karnataka, India, demonstrating LLMs can process document-specific structural hierarchies.

Conclusion: LLM-based techniques offer a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases, with promise for broader applications in developing country contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.

*Qihang Zhang,Muchen Li,Ziao Wang,Renjie Liao,Lele Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework combining universal compressors with neural language models via weighted Product of Experts to improve text compression without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional universal compressors are fast and broadly applicable but have worse compression rates than neural compressors, while neural compressors struggle with generalization to unseen data.

Method: Test-Time Steering via Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE) that adaptively combines universal compression model with pretrained neural language model at inference.

Result: Approach improves text compression performance without requiring fine-tuning and ensures compression rate is at least as good as the best individual model.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions that seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model.

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

### [12] [Bayesian Evaluation of Large Language Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10661)
*Rachel Longjohn,Shang Wu,Saatvik Kher,Catarina Belém,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Bayesian approach for quantifying statistical uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics for LLM-based text generation systems, addressing uncertainty from probabilistic text generation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation approaches neglect statistical uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for reliable assessment of system behavior like harmful output tendencies or sensitivity to adversarial inputs.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics, focusing on uncertainty induced by probabilistic text generation strategies in LLM-based systems.

Result: Applied to two case studies: refusal rates on adversarial inputs and pairwise LLM preferences on dialogue examples, demonstrating useful uncertainty quantification about LLM system behavior.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach provides valuable uncertainty quantification that enhances the reliability and interpretability of LLM evaluation metrics, particularly for assessing system behavior under probabilistic text generation.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

### [13] [Evaluating Modern Large Language Models on Low-Resource and Morphologically Rich Languages:A Cross-Lingual Benchmark Across Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10664)
*Chengxuan Xia,Qianye Wu,Hongbin Guan,Sixuan Tian,Yilun Hao,Xiaoyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of 7 LLMs on Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish across 4 tasks reveals proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude 3.5) lead but struggle with cultural nuances and morphological complexity, while smaller open-source models lag significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well in high-resource languages like English but their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored, requiring systematic evaluation across diverse linguistic contexts.

Method: Created cross-lingual benchmark covering Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish with 4 tasks (QA, summarization, translation, dialogue), combining human evaluations (fluency, factual accuracy, cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE).

Result: Proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude 3.5) generally lead but show significant gaps in cultural understanding and morphological generalization. All models struggle with language-specific challenges like Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models lag substantially in fluency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Significant resource disparity exists between proprietary and open-source models. Future LLM development needs to focus on better cultural awareness and linguistic generalization, especially for morphologically rich and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

*Cristina Pinneri,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework improves semantic robustness of LLM guard models by enforcing prediction consistency across paraphrases using skew-aware aggregation, reducing semantic variability by ~58% and improving calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guard models for LLM safety are vulnerable to superficial linguistic variations, showing large fluctuations in safety scores even for meaning-preserving paraphrases, revealing lack of semantic grounding.

Method: Practical self-supervised framework using paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency with novel skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation, avoiding degradation from standard methods like mean and median.

Result: Reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, generalizes to unseen stylistic variations, and improves model calibration by up to 40%.

Conclusion: Semantic consistency should be treated as a first-class training objective, revealing bidirectional relationship between calibration and consistency, providing scalable recipe for more reliable guard models.

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

TL;DR: STaDS framework evaluates LLM understanding through structured decision simulations, revealing that models often lack consistent accuracy across domains and show mismatches between stated rationales and actual decision factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs achieve high accuracy but may lack genuine understanding, which requires consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and domains using relevant decision factors.

Method: Introduces Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS) - expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs through question comprehension, knowledge-based prediction, and reliance on relevant decision factors across 15 diverse domains.

Result: Analysis of 9 frontier LLMs shows: (a) most struggle with consistent accuracy across domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful with frequent mismatches between stated rationales and actual decision factors.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' genuine understanding ability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

TL;DR: Deep transfer learning (DTL) with bilinear attention-based fusion outperforms traditional machine learning in predicting cochlear implant language outcomes using brain neuroanatomic features, achieving 92.39% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high variability in cochlear implant language outcomes that cannot be reliably predicted by traditional factors like age at implantation or residual hearing.

Method: Compared traditional ML vs DTL algorithms using brain neuroanatomic features from 278 implanted children across three centers, employing binary classification of high vs low language improvers with bilinear attention-based fusion strategy.

Result: DTL achieved 92.39% accuracy, 91.22% sensitivity, 93.56% specificity, and AUC of 0.977, significantly outperforming traditional ML models in all measures.

Conclusion: DTL enables direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information through representation learning, supporting feasibility of a single global prediction model for CI language outcomes.

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes enhancing LLMs with MoE speech projectors for code-switching speech translation, using multi-stage training with monolingual data and specialized losses to address data scarcity and semantic modeling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching speech translation faces challenges in semantic modeling complexity and data scarcity, with previous methods relying on implicit learning and costly manual annotations.

Method: Enhances LLMs with Mixture of Experts speech projectors where each expert specializes in a language's semantic subspace, plus multi-stage training using monolingual ASR/ST data with language-specific, load balancing, and transition losses.

Result: Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses code-switching speech translation challenges through specialized MoE architecture and multi-stage training paradigm.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GVF Finetuning systematically enhances MLLM visual factual consistency through data augmentation, instruction tuning, and consistency loss, significantly reducing hallucinations while maintaining general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models undermines reliability, and existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement in factual reasoning.

Method: Integrates explicit factual signals via Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, and Factual Consistency Loss function.

Result: Significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended and Yes/No Questions, while maintaining or slightly improving performance on general benchmarks like MME and POPE.

Conclusion: GVF effectively mitigates visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge when generating SQL queries from natural language, requiring a way to capture and reuse human expertise.

Method: Design multiple learning agent architectures that receive natural language feedback to refine queries and distill knowledge into structured memory for future reuse, with variations in how past experiences are captured and retrieved.

Result: Memory-augmented agents, especially the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction on the BIRD benchmark Dev set by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, enabling more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from human feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.

TL;DR: Proposes TopK + L2D, a two-stage demonstration selection method for in-context learning that considers both semantic similarity and label distribution alignment using a fine-tuned small language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demonstration selection methods for in-context learning focus mainly on semantic similarity but overlook label distribution alignment, which can significantly affect LLM performance.

Method: Two-stage selection: first uses TopK for semantic similarity, then applies Label Distribution Divergence (L2D) using a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model to generate and compare label distributions between test inputs and demonstrations.

Result: Outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies across seven text classification benchmarks, with performance positively correlated with the accuracy of the underlying small language models.

Conclusion: Considering both semantic similarity and label distribution alignment in demonstration selection leads to better in-context learning performance for text classification tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

*Shien Zhu,Samuel Bohl,Robin Oester,Gustavo Alonso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes pre-attention expert prediction for accurate and lightweight expert prefetching in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving ~15% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing expert prediction methods use activations from previous layers, resulting in low accuracy and inability to optimize the first layer. Complex prediction approaches introduce high computation overhead.

Method: Utilizes activations before attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss, leveraging ranking-preserving functions in LLMs for accurate expert prediction.

Result: Achieves 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing ~15% absolute accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Pre-attention expert prediction provides accurate and lightweight expert prefetching that works for all layers including the first layer, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

*Anupama Sitaraman,Bharathan Balaji,Yuvraj Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpiderGen is an LLM-based workflow that generates Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) process information for estimating environmental impact of consumer goods, achieving 62% F1-Score and significant cost/time savings compared to traditional LCA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change concerns require tools to estimate environmental impact of consumer products, particularly through Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) that track production, use, and disposal processes.

Method: SpiderGen integrates traditional LCA taxonomy and methodology with LLM reasoning capabilities to generate procedural information for LCA, evaluated against real-world LCA documents as ground-truth.

Result: SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information (fully correct or with minor errors) with 62% F1-Score, outperforms baseline techniques like chain-of-thought and one-shot prompting, and reduces costs from over $25,000 to under $1 USD while cutting time from 21-person days to under 10 minutes.

Conclusion: SpiderGen demonstrates strong potential to reduce human effort and costs for carbon impact estimation by automating LCA process generation using LLMs, though some errors occur due to differences in document detail and scope definitions.

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

TL;DR: Analysis of how LLM alignment methods (SFT, DPO, RLHF) affect vulnerability to prompt attacks, showing that small prompt variations significantly impact attack success rates and existing benchmarks may miss vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different LLM alignment methods affect models' responses to prompt attacks and evaluate the sensitivity of attack success rates to prompt variations.

Method: Selected open source models with different alignment methods (SFT, DPO, RLHF) and conducted systematic analysis using statistical methods to measure ASR sensitivity to prompt variations.

Result: Small prompt modifications significantly change Attack Success Rate (ASR), making models more or less susceptible to attacks. Existing attack benchmarks alone may not reveal all vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Systematic, statistically-based analysis of alignment methods is crucial for comprehensive model attack evaluation, as ASR is highly sensitive to prompt variations.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant robustness vulnerabilities when repeatedly prompted with simple follow-ups like "Think again", causing accuracy drops of 7.5-10% across multiple turns. Markov chain analysis reveals stationary accuracy is ~8% lower than initial accuracy, establishing it as a key robustness metric for interactive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in interactive applications, evaluating their robustness across multiple turns becomes essential for real-world reliability, especially in high-stakes settings where consistent reasoning matters.

Method: Used simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to test answer changes, modeled accuracy dynamics with Markov chains, and examined whether linear probes from hidden states can predict answer changes.

Result: Simple prompts like "Think again" caused ~10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over 9 turns; combined with reworded questions caused 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Markov chains effectively model accuracy dynamics, revealing stationary accuracy is ~8% lower than first-turn accuracy. Linear probes show predictive capability for answer changes.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant fragility under repeated questioning, making stationary accuracy a crucial robustness metric for interactive deployments. Addressing this instability is essential for high-stakes applications requiring consistent reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

TL;DR: Recursive prompting with LLMs for synthetic data generation shows gender bias equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification, with contrastive augmentation achieving significant downstream bias reduction despite higher embedding-based bias scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gender bias dynamics in recursive text generation with LLMs and evaluate bias mitigation strategies, addressing the risk of bias amplification in synthetic dataset generation.

Method: Used three generations of recursive text generation with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies, evaluated through rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance.

Result: Found equilibrium dynamics: low initial bias amplified toward model's inherent bias (+36%), high initial bias decayed toward it (-26%). Contrastive augmentation achieved 98.8% downstream bias reduction for low initial bias and 91% average reduction, despite higher embedding-based bias scores.

Conclusion: Semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the opaque hidden language of closed-source multimodal systems by leveraging their inherent preference bias during image compression and reconstruction processes.

Method: Uses multi-round "telephone game" framework to strategically leverage systems' preference bias, observing concept co-occurrence frequencies to quantitatively investigate concept connection strength. Introduces Telescope dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs.

Result: Enables construction of global concept connection maps, identification of training-inherited preference bias, assessment of generalization capability, discovery of stable concept pathways, and uncovering of unexpected concept relationships beyond textual/visual similarities.

Conclusion: Provides new perspective on multimodal systems' hidden language and lays foundation for future research on interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

TL;DR: Squid Game is a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework for LLMs that addresses data contamination issues in static benchmarks by testing models in resource-constrained, asymmetric information scenarios through interactive gameplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks struggle with data contamination (models may have seen test questions before) and don't evaluate LLM behavior under pressure or in adversarial settings. There's a need for trustworthy evaluation frameworks that test genuine problem-solving abilities.

Method: Created Squid Game - a dynamic adversarial environment with 6 elimination-style levels testing instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. Models compete against other LLM opponents in resource-constrained, asymmetric information settings.

Result: Evaluated 50+ LLMs, revealing generational performance transitions and evidence that some models use speculative shortcuts to win. Dynamic evaluation serves as complementary to static benchmarks, highlighting potential contamination in traditional evaluation paradigms.

Conclusion: Dynamic adversarial evaluation like Squid Game provides valuable complementary assessment to static benchmarks, revealing model behaviors under pressure and helping address data contamination issues in LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

*Eyal Rabin,Zohar Elyoseph,Rotem Israel-Fishelson,Adi Dali,Ravit Nussinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI text-to-speech systems implicitly learn to speak slower when prompted to be polite, replicating human social communication patterns without explicit programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems have internalized implicit human social cues like speech rate reduction for politeness, which are not explicitly programmed.

Method: Prompted 22 synthetic voices from AI Studio and OpenAI to read a fixed script under "polite and formal" vs "casual and informal" conditions, then measured speech duration.

Result: Polite prompts consistently produced slower speech than casual prompts across both platforms with very large effect sizes, statistically significant for all AI Studio voices and most OpenAI voices.

Conclusion: AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, demonstrating its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

*Aditya Pola,Vineeth N. Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies where instruction following begins in language models by measuring when interventions change predictions, finding an inflection point called 'onset' where early interventions become ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where in the layer stack instruction following begins - the transition point from reading to doing in language models.

Method: Used three simple datasets and activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs to measure layer-wise flip rates across Llama family models.

Result: Found an inflection point (onset) where interventions that change predictions before this point become ineffective afterward, with similar onset locations in multi-hop compositions.

Conclusion: Provides a replicable method to locate where instruction following begins and compare this location across tasks and model sizes.

Abstract: Following an instruction involves distinct sub-processes, such as reading content, reading the instruction, executing it, and producing an answer. We ask where, along the layer stack, instruction following begins, the point where reading gives way to doing. We introduce three simple datasets (Key-Value, Quote Attribution, Letter Selection) and two hop compositions of these tasks. Using activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs, we measure a layer-wise flip rate that indicates when substituting selected residual activations changes the predicted answer. Across models in the Llama family, we observe an inflection point, which we term onset, where interventions that change predictions before this point become largely ineffective afterward. Multi-hop compositions show a similar onset location. These results provide a simple, replicable way to locate where instruction following begins and to compare this location across tasks and model sizes.

*Jonghyeon Choi,Yeonjun Choi,Hyun-chul Kim,Beakcheol Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines nation-level biases in LLMs using UN Security Council data, develops a bias evaluation framework, and introduces a debiasing method combining RAG with Reflexion that reduces bias and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate nation-level biases in LLMs within International Relations, particularly focusing on the five permanent UNSC members, and address the need for bias assessment alongside performance in IR applications.

Method: Developed a bias evaluation framework with three tests using UNSC historical records, and introduced a debiasing framework combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques.

Result: LLMs show varying nation-level biases (favorable to western nations, unfavorable to Russia) that change across models and contexts. Models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit reduced bias. The debiasing framework effectively reduces bias and improves performance, especially in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

Conclusion: LLM biases are multidimensional and vary across models and tasks. Assessing nation-level bias alongside performance is crucial when applying LLMs in International Relations, and the proposed debiasing framework offers an effective solution.

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ΠAttention is a periodic sparse Transformer that achieves linear complexity while providing better long-range modeling than RingAttention through deterministic periodic skips and adaptive fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic complexity with sequence length, and existing sparse attention methods like RingAttention have limited receptive fields and lack adaptability.

Method: Factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic π-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate to maintain linear complexity while improving receptive field coverage.

Result: Achieves 8.3% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50% fewer GPUs, with proven O(kL + πlogL) receptive field growth compared to O(kL) for RingAttention.

Conclusion: Periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination are crucial for efficient long-context modeling, matching or surpassing dense attention quality with linear complexity.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer health question summarization can improve healthcare communication, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks to patient safety.

Method: Proposed framework combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned LLaMA-2-7B model on MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets.

Result: Achieved consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation shows over 80% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information.

Conclusion: Faithfulness is essential for reliable medical summarization, and the approach demonstrates potential for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Result: GPT-4o achieved strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98 correlation) and exact score agreement in 55% of quiz cases. For project reports, it showed strong overall alignment but some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o have significant potential for automated educational assessment but also exhibit limitations, particularly for technical open-ended responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

*Abir Harrasse,Florent Draye,Zhijing Jin,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs use pivot language representations where early layers create shared multilingual representations and later layers perform language-specific decoding, with performance favoring the dominant training language due to reliance on high-frequency language features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multilingual LLMs internally represent different languages and why performance favors dominant training languages despite shared representations.

Method: Train LLMs on different multilingual data mixtures, analyze with cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs, and perform feature interventions to manipulate language outputs.

Result: Found evidence for pivot language representations with shared early representations and language-specific decoding in later layers; identified small set of high-frequency language features that can be manipulated to switch languages in outputs.

Conclusion: Understanding pivot-language mechanisms is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs, as dominant training language influences attribution graphs and decoding pathways.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

*Rebecca Dorn,Christina Chance,Casandra Rusti,Charles Bickham,Kai-Wei Chang,Fred Morstatter,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emotion recognition models show racial bias, falsely classifying African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as angry more than twice as often as General American English, reinforcing stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how emotion AI models perform on African American Vernacular English compared to General American English, addressing concerns about cultural bias in automated emotion detection systems.

Method: Analyzed 2.7M geo-tagged tweets from LA, scored AAVE strength using computational dialect features, collected emotion annotations on 875 tweets, used community-informed "silver" labels from AAVE-fluent African American annotators, and compared model performance across GPT, BERT, and SpanEmo.

Result: Models showed false positive anger rates more than double on AAVE vs GAE; SpanEmo increased false anger rates from 25% to 60%; models correlated more with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations; neighborhoods with more African American residents had higher anger predictions (r=0.27) and lower joy predictions (r=-0.10).

Conclusion: Emotion AI systems exhibit emergent safety issues by reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased classification, highlighting the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing.

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

TL;DR: Task arithmetic for LLM skill transfer suffers from negative interference. This paper addresses this by first aligning parameter spaces using Transformer symmetries, adapting for GQA and SwiGLU layers, enabling successful reasoning skill transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard task arithmetic for transferring skills between LLMs often fails due to negative interference when models have diverged during training, limiting effective skill sharing across model families.

Method: Align parameter spaces first using Transformer architecture symmetries (permutation, rotation, scaling), adapt alignment for Grouped-Query Attention and SwiGLU layers using both weight-based and activation-based approaches.

Result: Successfully transferred advanced reasoning skills to non-reasoning models, with experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks showing consistent outperformance over standard task arithmetic.

Conclusion: The alignment-first strategy provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

TL;DR: LLM judges show inconsistent conviction when tasks shift from direct factual queries to conversational judgment tasks, with models exhibiting sycophantic or overly-critical tendencies under minimal dialogue framing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can reliably assess tasks requiring social or conversational judgment, particularly how their conviction changes when tasks are reframed from direct factual queries to conversational contexts.

Method: Evaluation framework contrasting model performance on direct factual queries vs. conversational judgment tasks, applying pressure through simple rebuttals to measure conviction maintenance.

Result: Models show significant performance changes (average 9.24%) under conversational framing - GPT-4o-mini becomes sycophantic while Llama-8B-Instruct becomes overly-critical. Minimal dialogue context substantially alters model judgment.

Conclusion: Conversational framing is a key factor in LLM-based evaluation, and the proposed framework provides a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction to develop more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

*Jongyoon Song,Sangwon Yu,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias where prompt format influences responses more than semantics, with models tending to generate negative answers when lacking sufficient knowledge in yes-no questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the detailed factors influencing negative bias in LLMs, particularly how prompt formats and parametric knowledge affect binary decision tasks.

Method: Introduced a pipeline to construct evaluation sets categorized by parametric knowledge (correct, incorrect, insufficient knowledge), analyzed shortcut behaviors, and tested various prompting scenarios including context provision, "I don't know" options, and chain-of-thought.

Result: Models show shortcut behavior of generating negative responses when lacking knowledge; providing context and "I don't know" options reduces negative bias, while chain-of-thought amplifies it; bias degree varies by prompt type.

Conclusion: Multiple factors influence negative bias in LLMs, with prompt format playing a crucial role, providing insights for mitigating this bias through appropriate prompting strategies.

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

*Farima Fatahi Bayat,Pouya Pezeshkpour,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) show improved final-answer accuracy but suffer from Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), where tools substitute for reasoning, leading to degraded reasoning quality despite correct tool execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether tool-enabled gains in TaLMs reflect trustworthy reasoning, focusing on whether tools are used as reasoning aids or as substitutes for reasoning.

Method: Developed PYMATH benchmark with 1,679 competition-level math problems requiring Python code, created multi-dimensional evaluation suite, and proposed preference-optimization framework to realign tool usage.

Result: TaLMs achieved up to 19.3% gain in final-answer accuracy but showed 41.5% worse reasoning in pairwise comparisons, with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Tool use shifts errors from arithmetic to global reasoning failures.

Conclusion: Tool use degrades reasoning quality in TaLMs, but preference optimization can realign tools as assistive evidence to improve both accuracy and reasoning depth.

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

TL;DR: EMSQA introduces a medical QA dataset with clinical expertise context and proposes Expert-CoT and ExpertRAG methods that improve LLM performance on EMS certification exams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for medical QA overlook domain-specific expertise like clinical subject areas and certification levels, limiting performance in high-stakes medical settings.

Method: Created EMSQA dataset (24.3K questions across 10 clinical areas and 4 certification levels) with aligned knowledge bases. Developed Expert-CoT (context-aware chain-of-thought) and ExpertRAG (subject-aligned retrieval pipeline).

Result: Expert-CoT improves accuracy by up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT. Combined Expert-CoT+ExpertRAG achieves up to 4.59% gain over standard RAG. 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all EMS certification simulation exams.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinical expertise context through specialized prompting and retrieval significantly improves LLM performance in medical QA, enabling certification-level competency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

*Ramya Kumar,Dhruv Gulwani,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares various ML approaches for classifying exam questions using Bloom's Taxonomy, finding that SVM with data augmentation outperforms complex deep learning models and achieves 94% accuracy on a small dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automatically classify educational content according to Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels, which is important for educational assessment and curriculum design.

Method: Used traditional ML (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM), RNN architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa), and LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic) on a 600-sentence dataset with various preprocessing and augmentation strategies.

Result: SVM with data augmentation achieved best performance (94% accuracy/recall/F1), while RNNs and BERT suffered severe overfitting. LLMs achieved ~0.72-0.73 accuracy in zero-shot evaluation.

Conclusion: Complex deep models struggle with limited data; careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms like SVM are more effective for Bloom's Taxonomy classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical embeddings from PubMed research literature don't capture clinical cardiology's procedural knowledge and specialized terminology from textbooks, limiting clinical application effectiveness.

Method: Trained CardioEmbed using Qwen3-Embedding-8B with contrastive learning on 150,000 deduplicated sentences from 7 cardiology textbooks, employing InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives.

Result: Achieved 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific tasks (+15.94pp over MedTE), with competitive performance on MTEB benchmarks: BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval performance, significantly improving over existing medical embedding models.

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

Motivation: Current translation evaluation methods focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency, which is inadequate for discourse-level translation in expert domains that require coherence and terminological precision.

Method: Created DiscoX benchmark with 200 professional texts from 7 domains (avg. 1700+ tokens) and developed Metric-S, a reference-free evaluation system for fine-grained assessment across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness.

Result: Metric-S significantly outperforms existing metrics and shows strong consistency with human judgments. Advanced LLMs still trail human experts significantly, validating the difficulty of DiscoX.

Conclusion: DiscoX and Metric-S provide a robust framework for rigorous evaluation of professional-grade machine translation, highlighting remaining challenges in achieving human-expert level performance and facilitating future LLM-based translation advancements.

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

TL;DR: Comprehensive analysis of open-source DPO datasets reveals quality disparities, leading to creation of UltraMix - a curated 30% smaller dataset that outperforms individual datasets across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic comparisons of DPO datasets are scarce due to high computational costs and lack of quality annotations, making it difficult to understand preference selection, task coverage, and human judgment alignment.

Method: Used Magpie framework to annotate samples for task category, input quality, and preference reward; systematically curated UltraMix by selectively drawing from five corpora while removing noisy/redundant samples.

Result: Revealed structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins across datasets; UltraMix is 30% smaller than best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks.

Conclusion: Data-centric preference optimization through systematic curation can create more efficient and effective DPO mixtures, with released annotations and UltraMix facilitating future research.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Renormalization is a training-free method that removes consistent bias from text embeddings, improving performance on MMTEB benchmarks by 9.7σ for retrieval, 3.1σ for classification, and 0.8σ for other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias across all sentences, limiting their performance potential.

Method: Proposed Renormalization - a plug-and-play, training-free solution that subtracts either the bias vector μ directly or its projection from embedding vectors.

Result: Across 38 models, renormalization significantly improved performance: 9.7σ on retrieval, 3.1σ on classification, and 0.8σ on other tasks. Projection-based subtraction performed better than direct subtraction.

Conclusion: Renormalization effectively removes embedding bias and consistently enhances model performance across various tasks without requiring retraining.

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue models struggle in noisy, multi-speaker environments, producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking, which limits their real-world applicability.

Method: Combines acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets to enable robust streaming transcription, turn-boundary detection, and response generation.

Result: Outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality.

Conclusion: Visual cues combined with audio significantly improve speaker-aware interaction, enabling robust spoken dialogue agents for real-world noisy environments.

Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoDetector is a novel framework for Meme Emotion Understanding that uses MLLMs to extract implicit meanings and employs dual-stage multimodal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meme emotion understanding methods lack fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies and fail to adequately mine memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a four-step textual enhancement module using MLLMs to extract implicit contextual insights, followed by a dual-stage modal fusion strategy that performs shallow fusion on raw data and deep integration of enhanced features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 4.3% F1 improvement on MET-MEME and 3.4% on MOOD datasets. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.

Conclusion: MemoDetector effectively addresses key challenges in meme emotion understanding through enhanced textual analysis and hierarchical multimodal fusion, demonstrating strong potential for advancing the field.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

TL;DR: SAP² method improves ASR performance in contextualized scenarios by dynamically pruning and integrating relevant keywords using speech-driven attention pooling, achieving state-of-the-art results on SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with long-context information in domain-specific scenarios like conference presentations due to limited context windows and contextual noise.

Method: Two-stage framework with Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords while compressing context embeddings.

Result: Achieved WER of 7.71% on SlideSpeech and 1.12% on LibriSpeech, with 41.1% reduction in biased keyword error rates on SlideSpeech compared to non-contextual baselines.

Conclusion: SAP² effectively handles long-context scenarios with robust scalability and significant performance improvements in contextual ASR tasks.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

*Udo Schlegel,Franziska Weeber,Jian Lan,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLIP's robustness to paraphrasing is measured using the new Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric, revealing sensitivity variations and gender-based differences in paraphrase stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's robustness to linguistic variation, especially paraphrasing, is underexplored but crucial for reliable deployment in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases.

Method: Introduces Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM) and uses Social Counterfactuals dataset to empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation and examine interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender.

Result: Robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.

Conclusion: Paraphrase robustness is essential for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems, with gender-based variations in stability requiring attention.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a widely used multimodal model that aligns text and image representations through large-scale training. While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.

### [60] [Adverbs Revisited: Enhancing WordNet Coverage of Adverbs with a Supersense Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11214)
*Jooyoung Lee,Jader Martins Camboim de Sá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a systematic supersense typology for adverbs to address WordNet's lack of semantic classification for adverbs, with categories covering manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet provides rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs but lacks systematic semantic classification for adverbs, leaving them underdeveloped compared to other parts of speech.

Method: The authors developed a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs and empirically validated it through a pilot annotation study where human annotators assigned these categories to adverbs in natural text.

Result: The pilot annotation study demonstrated that the proposed adverb supersense categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators.

Conclusion: Incorporating this adverb supersense typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it better with linguistic theory, and facilitates various NLP applications including word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling.

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

*Jader Martins Camboim de Sá,Jooyoung Lee,Cédric Pruski,Marcos Da Silveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANE is an adversarial training method that improves fine-grained word meaning resolution in neural language models by generating challenging negative examples through selective marking of alternate words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural language models often overfit to global sentence representations and fail to capture local semantic details, making fine-grained word meaning resolution a critical challenge.

Method: Proposes LANE - an adversarial training strategy that shifts learning focus to target words by generating negative examples through selective marking of alternate words in training data, forcing greater separability between same sentences with different marked words.

Result: Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks show improved performance over standard contrastive learning baselines, with more discriminative word representations that better capture subtle meaning differences.

Conclusion: LANE is a model-agnostic method that can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks to enhance fine-grained word meaning resolution by focusing on local semantic details.

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

*Sania Nayab,Marco Simoni,Giulio Rossolini,Andrea Saracino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid pipeline for generating natural language QA pairs from knowledge graphs using template clustering and LLM refinement to ensure scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generating QA pairs from knowledge graphs struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency, which limits their effectiveness for educational platforms and LLM testing.

Method: Clusters KG triplets by relations to create reusable templates using natural language rules, refines templates with LLMs for clarity and coherence, and instantiates answer options with distractors from the KG.

Result: The hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs that combine scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses key limitations of existing methods by leveraging both structured KG processing and LLM refinement to produce scalable, linguistically sound, and factually consistent QA pairs.

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

### [63] [iMAD: Intelligent Multi-Agent Debate for Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11306)
*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iMAD is a token-efficient multi-agent debate framework that selectively triggers debates only when likely to correct wrong answers, reducing token usage by up to 92% while improving accuracy by up to 13.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) is inefficient as it triggers debates for every query, incurring high computational costs and potentially degrading accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers.

Method: iMAD prompts a single agent to produce structured self-critique responses, extracts 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues, and uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier trained with FocusCal loss to determine when to trigger MAD.

Result: Extensive experiments on six visual question answering datasets show iMAD reduces token usage by up to 92% while improving final answer accuracy by up to 13.5% compared to five competitive baselines.

Conclusion: iMAD provides an efficient and effective framework for multi-agent debate by intelligently triggering debates only when beneficial, achieving significant computational savings while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Conclusion: The work contributes to developing more robust machine learning models by exposing vulnerabilities through novel adversarial attack strategies, with emphasis on utility usage reduction and efficiency.

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational demands of large language models in financial NLP applications, making advanced financial analysis more accessible to organizations with limited resources.

Method: Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET) analyzes hidden state representations to identify and selectively fine-tune the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs while freezing less critical layers.

Result: LAET outperforms existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 on financial NLP tasks, even with smaller models (~3B parameters), while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: LAET bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research with real-world deployment by providing efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: Digitized histopathology analysis involves complex, time-intensive workflows and specialized expertise, limiting its accessibility. We introduce NOVA, an agentic framework that translates scientific queries into executable analysis pipelines by iteratively generating and running Python code. NOVA integrates 49 domain-specific tools (e.g., nuclei segmentation, whole-slide encoding) built on open-source software, and can also create new tools ad hoc. To evaluate such systems, we present SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark -- verified by pathologists and biomedical scientists -- spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Unlike prior biomedical benchmarks focused on knowledge recall or diagnostic QA, SlideQuest demands multi-step reasoning, iterative coding, and computational problem solving. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

TL;DR: LMs learn attested and impossible languages equally well when complexity is controlled, unlike humans who find attested languages easier due to inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether language models share human inductive biases that make attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages.

Method: Review of literature comparing language model learning of attested vs impossible languages, analyzing complexity factors.

Result: LMs learn attested and impossible languages equally well when complexity is accounted for; difficult impossible languages are simply more complex or random.

Conclusion: LMs lack human inductive biases that support language acquisition, explaining why they don't show the same preference for attested languages as humans.

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics without requiring explicit user prompts, enabling natural interaction in multi-conversation settings.

Method: Dual-model architecture: lightweight streaming model (12.5 ms intervals) for low-latency partner extraction, plus slower model for longer-range conversational dynamics. Uses self-speech as anchor and turn-taking behavior.

Result: Successful generalization on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets from 11 participants (6.8 hours), effectively identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings.

Conclusion: Marks progress toward proactive hearing assistants that autonomously adapt to conversational engagement and dynamics, enabling more natural hearing assistance.

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods like RLHF are costly, lack scalability, and offer limited dynamic control during inference, creating need for adaptable alignment mechanisms.

Method: Formulates LLM alignment as optimal heuristic search using MCTS with weak model's step-level signals as alignment proxies and Entropy-Aware exploration to guide strong model generation.

Result: Consistently outperforms baselines across sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following tasks, improving Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19 (15.9% relative improvement) on summarization.

Conclusion: W2S-AlignTree provides scalable, fine-grained alignment without model retraining, enabling dynamic control during inference through weak-to-strong generalization paradigm.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.

Models with similar overall scores diverged significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes included inaccurate judgments, lack of process transparency, and incomplete reasoning.

Conclusion: Current AI models have critical gaps in reliability for professional adoption, particularly in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, highlighting the need for more realistic benchmarks and improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops an analytic framework to determine when AI capability growth could escalate without bound versus when it can be ruled out, providing testable conditions and practical safety controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace speculation about AI "runaway growth" with precise, measurable conditions that determine whether capability escalation can occur without bound in finite time.

Method: Developed an analytic framework linking capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies, using physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory to define a service envelope that caps improvement.

Result: Derived decision rules that map observable metrics into yes/no certificates for runaway vs nonsingular behavior, providing falsifiable tests based on improvement acceleration rates and practical safety controls like power caps and throughput throttling.

Conclusion: The framework replaces speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity, though limitations include dependence on chosen capability metrics and need for future work on stochastic dynamics and multi-agent competition.

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Abstract: CAR-Scenes is a frame-level dataset for autonomous driving that enables training and evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs) for interpretable, scene-level understanding. We annotate 5,192 images drawn from Argoverse 1, Cityscapes, KITTI, and nuScenes using a 28-key category/sub-category knowledge base covering environment, road geometry, background-vehicle behavior, ego-vehicle behavior, vulnerable road users, sensor states, and a discrete severity scale (1-10), totaling 350+ leaf attributes. Labels are produced by a GPT-4o-assisted vision-language pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification; we release the exact prompts, post-processing rules, and per-field baseline model performance. CAR-Scenes also provides attribute co-occurrence graphs and JSONL records that support semantic retrieval, dataset triage, and risk-aware scenario mining across sources. To calibrate task difficulty, we include reproducible, non-benchmark baselines, notably a LoRA-tuned Qwen2-VL-2B with deterministic decoding, evaluated via scalar accuracy, micro-averaged F1 for list attributes, and severity MAE/RMSE on a fixed validation split. We publicly release the annotation and analysis scripts, including graph construction and evaluation scripts, to enable explainable, data-centric workflows for future intelligent vehicles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery has procedural variability, difficult learning curves, and complications that affect outcomes. Video-based assessment can provide data-driven insights to reduce variability and improve surgical performance.

Method: Used Delphi process to achieve consensus on workflow descriptors, developed ColoWorkflow tool, applied it to 54 colorectal surgery videos from 5 centers, and evaluated applicability and inter-rater reliability.

Result: Achieved consensus on 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps. ColoWorkflow showed broad applicability with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies occurred at phase transitions and step boundaries.

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow is the first validated video-based assessment tool for colorectal surgery workflows, providing a reproducible framework for performance assessment, benchmarking, and AI-driven workflow recognition to standardize training and improve surgical quality.

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

### [78] [Frequency-Aware Vision-Language Multimodality Generalization Network for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10774)
*Junjie Zhang,Feng Zhao,Hanqiang Liu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FVMGN, a frequency-aware vision-language network for remote sensing multimodality generalization, using diffusion-based augmentation, frequency domain disentanglement, and spatial-frequency feature alignment to overcome data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing technology creates multimodality generalization challenges where models must handle data heterogeneity and cross-scene generalization. Existing vision-language models lack RS-specific linguistic knowledge and struggle with multimodal RS data.

Method: Uses diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation for multimodal land-cover reconstruction, multimodal wavelet disentanglement for cross-domain invariant features, spatial-frequency-aware image encoder for local-global feature representation, and multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment for unified semantic space.

Result: Extensive experiments show FVMGN achieves excellent multimodality generalization ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FVMGN framework effectively addresses RS multimodality generalization by leveraging frequency-aware processing, multimodal disentanglement, and spatial-frequency alignment to overcome data heterogeneity and improve cross-scene generalization.

Abstract: The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Motivation: To further reduce trainable parameters in point cloud fine-tuning beyond existing PEFT methods, as general approaches are suboptimal for point cloud data.

Method: Learns dynamic graphs from initial transformer tokenized inputs using lightweight graph convolution, then passes graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules.

Result: Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation show GFT rivals existing methods while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: GFT provides an effective point-cloud-specific PEFT approach that significantly reduces parameter count while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed LRP-based pruning method successfully addresses accuracy degradation issues in existing approaches, enabling practical model compression for resource-constrained environments with limited data.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Conclusion: MCN-CL effectively addresses modal heterogeneity and category imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, demonstrating superior performance through cross-attention and contrastive learning techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attribution methods based on submodular subset selection have high faithfulness but suffer from efficiency limitations that hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: PhaseWin replaces quadratic-cost greedy selection with phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to approximate greedy behavior while reducing model evaluations.

Result: PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% computational budget, and consistently outperforms other baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

Conclusion: PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models, enabling practical deployment with near-linear complexity.

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision to enhance OOD detection by using LLM-initialized prompts that capture inter-class features and transfer semantic knowledge to visual modality via graph-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current negative prompts in vision-language models for OOD detection often include broad non-ID features, leading to suboptimal performance due to overlapping or misleading information capture.

Method: Uses class-specific positive/negative prompts initialized by LLMs, optimizes them to focus on intra-class and boundary features respectively, and employs graph-based architecture to propagate semantic supervision to visual branch for energy-based OOD detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K across 8 OOD datasets and 5 LLMs show superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances OOD detection by better capturing semantic boundaries through optimized prompt supervision and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: YOLOv12n outperforms YOLOv11n on FER tasks with higher mAP scores, while YOLOv11n shows better precision on noisy datasets, demonstrating a trade-off between sensitivity and precision in lightweight models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the performance of lightweight YOLO models (YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n) for Facial Expression Recognition in real-world environments, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Converted FER2013 and KDEF datasets to object detection format and evaluated model performance using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices within a unified detection and classification framework.

Result: YOLOv12n achieved highest mAP 0.5 of 95.6 on KDEF and 63.8 on FER2013, while YOLOv11n showed higher precision (65.2) on FER2013. Models performed better on clean KDEF with clearer class separation.

Conclusion: Lightweight YOLO models effectively balance performance and efficiency, with YOLOv12n offering better sensitivity and YOLOv11n providing better precision, making them suitable for real-time emotion-aware AI applications.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCD is a novel heterogeneous knowledge distillation framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features through shared logits, using sub-logit decoupled distillation and orthogonality loss to enhance knowledge transfer between different architectures like ViT and ResNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods struggle with heterogeneous architectures due to spatial feature representation differences, and existing heterogeneous KD approaches have high computational costs, complex designs, or over-rely on logit alignment, limiting their ability to leverage complementary features.

Method: Proposes HCD framework with Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) that processes student's intermediate features via convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates with teacher's penultimate layer features, and maps to shared logits. Introduces Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions shared logits into n sub-logits fused with teacher's logits, and Orthogonality Loss (OL) to ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Fine-grained datasets (e.g., CUB200), and ImageNet-1K demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods in heterogeneous knowledge distillation scenarios.

Conclusion: HCD effectively addresses heterogeneous KD challenges by preserving student-specific strengths while leveraging teacher knowledge, enhancing robustness and generalization in students, establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

TL;DR: FedBCS addresses feature heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation by aligning domain-invariant contextual prototypes across layers, using frequency-domain style recalibration and dual-level prototype alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature heterogeneity from diverse medical scanners/protocols limits federated learning effectiveness. Existing methods focus only on final-layer features and fail to address style bias accumulation in intermediate layers.

Method: Proposes FedBCS with frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration for prototype construction and context-aware dual-level prototype alignment across encoder and decoder layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: FedBCS effectively bridges feature representation gaps in federated medical image segmentation through domain-invariant contextual prototype alignment.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with 3D-related tasks like spatial cognition and physical understanding due to the modality gap between 3D tasks and 2D training, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications like robotics.

Method: Introduces a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline with four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning using abstract bounding boxes.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in spatial intelligence across multiple benchmarks, including an 8.3% gain on SAT Real compared to baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced 3D reasoning ability.

Conclusion: Equipping VLMs with 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning capabilities without additional training, opening new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM is a multimodal LLM approach for micro expression recognition that addresses motion-semantic alignment through multi-expert disentanglement and a motion-driven instruction dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MER methods struggle with: (1) entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues, preventing focus on subtle motion; (2) semantic gap between text labels and actual facial muscle movements in existing datasets.

Method: Proposes DEFT-LLM with multi-expert disentanglement architecture (structure, dynamic textures, motion-semantics experts) and introduces Uni-MER dataset with dual optical flow and AU constraints for motion-text alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MER benchmarks and demonstrates superior interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: The method successfully injects physical priors for micro expressions while leveraging LLM reasoning, enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues through motion-semantic alignment.

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LGRLN, a language-guided graph network for video summarization that converts frames into structured graphs and uses dual-threshold graph convolution to capture semantic relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with capturing global dependencies, accommodating multimodal user customization, and addressing the mismatch between temporal and semantic proximity in video frames.

Method: Uses a video graph generator to convert frames into structured graphs (forward, backward, undirected), intra-graph relational reasoning with dual-threshold graph convolution, and language-guided cross-modal embedding. Models summary generation as Bernoulli mixture distribution solved with EM algorithm.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, reduces inference time by 87.8% and model parameters by 91.7%.

Conclusion: LGRLN effectively addresses challenges in video summarization by leveraging graph-based representation learning and language guidance, achieving superior performance with high efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

TL;DR: TG-DFER is a text-guided weakly supervised framework for dynamic facial expression recognition that uses vision-language models and multi-grained temporal modeling to address the many-to-one labeling problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in DFER caused by the many-to-one labeling problem, visual diversity of emotional expressions, and complex temporal dynamics in MIL-based approaches.

Method: Incorporates vision-language pre-trained models for semantic guidance, uses visual prompts to align textual emotion labels with visual features, and employs a multi-grained temporal network to capture both short-term dynamics and long-range emotional flow.

Result: TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision, as demonstrated by extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed text-guided framework effectively enhances MIL-based DFER by leveraging semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling, providing a robust solution for dynamic facial expression recognition.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMoE is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts transformer that uses eigenbasis reparameterization and cosine similarity routing to address routing instability and load imbalance issues in MoE architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance on vision and cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoE architectures face challenges with misaligned router logits causing unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances creating bottlenecks. Existing solutions like auxiliary load-balancing losses often weaken expert specialization and hurt performance.

Method: ERMoE reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score" - the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces.

Result: ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. A 3D MRI variant improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

Conclusion: ERMoE introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization, eliminating the need for explicit balancing losses.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

*Haoran Chen,Houze Xu,Micah Goldblum,Daoguo Dong,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMC is a two-stage framework for CLIP-based class-incremental learning that decouples vision encoder adaptation and textual prompt optimization to prevent classifier bias, with DMC-OT adding optimal-transport calibration to handle distributional drift in memory statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-based continual learning methods suffer from severe classifier bias where text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data is unavailable, and existing approaches using Gaussian statistics for replay overlook distributional drift when vision encoders are updated.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) adapt vision encoder with frozen text prompts, 2) optimize textual soft prompts with frozen vision encoder. DMC-OT adds optimal-transport guided calibration to align memory statistics across evolving encoders and task-specific prompting for better inter-task separability.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 show state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80% over DMC.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupled training approach effectively preserves cross-modal alignment in CLIP-based continual learning, and the optimal-transport calibration successfully addresses distributional drift issues, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

TL;DR: PAS is a training-free method that stabilizes Video LLM attention by applying small phase offsets across heads and aggregating outputs, smoothing the temporal kernel to reduce sensitivity to frame timing shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency where small frame timing shifts can flip attention and suppress relevant frames, traced to multimodal RoPE's inverse Fourier time kernel causing frame-scale ripples.

Method: Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS) applies small opposed phase offsets across attention heads and aggregates their outputs, preserving per-head spectrum magnitude while smoothing the temporal kernel without changing positional encoding structure.

Result: Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead under matched token budgets.

Conclusion: PAS provides a plug-and-play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs, achieving Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts through multi-phase averaging that attenuates high frequency ripples.

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

TL;DR: Training-free binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision using VLMs, converting open-ended queries to multiple-choice questions then True/False verification for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve zero-shot vision performance with off-the-shelf VLMs without requiring task-specific training, by leveraging inference-time design improvements.

Method: Two-step workflow: (1) Quantization - convert open-ended queries to multiple-choice questions with explicit candidates; (2) Binarization - ask True/False questions per candidate and resolve deterministically.

Result: Significant improvements across all evaluated tasks (referring expression grounding, spatial reasoning, BLINK-Jigsaw), with quantization providing large gains and binarization offering consistent additional boost.

Conclusion: The workflow provides a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with current VLMs, emphasizing inference-time design over training and establishing a formal hardness ladder for vision queries.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HPAC, a practical autoregressive framework for learned lossless image compression that overcomes computational limitations through hierarchical parallelism, progressive adaptation, and efficient inference optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are theoretically optimal for lossless image compression but are considered impractical due to prohibitive computational costs. This work aims to make pure autoregression practical while maintaining top performance.

Method: Proposes HPAC with hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating. Introduces Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI) for acceleration and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC) for high bit-depth images. Uses Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT) for instance-level adaptation.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art compression performance across diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical). Sets new benchmark in learned lossless compression with significant gains over existing methods using small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Conclusion: A carefully designed autoregressive framework can offer substantial compression improvements while being practical, challenging the conventional wisdom that AR models are too computationally expensive for real-world use.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

TL;DR: CLUE is a generative model framework that achieves diverse and stable image generation using fixed-format prompts without requiring additional data, particularly effective for specialized domains like medicine with limited datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods face limitations in specialized fields like medicine where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available, requiring a solution that can generate diverse images while maintaining stability without additional data.

Method: Based on Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are fed into a new second attention layer of U-Net. It uses Kullback-Leibler divergence to achieve continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions independent of prompts.

Result: On otitis media dataset, CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). Synthetic-only training at 1000% scale achieved F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combined synthetic and real data achieved F1 score of 94.76%, outperforming real-only data.

Conclusion: CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications, demonstrating superior performance on both internal and external medical datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE is a multimodal framework that uses prompt-attention hierarchical contrastive learning to maintain robust cross-modal representations when modalities are missing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models degrade significantly when modalities are missing in real-world scenarios due to inconsistent representation learning between complete and incomplete data.

Method: Incorporates multimodal prompt learning into hierarchical contrastive learning with a prompt-attention mechanism that dynamically generates consistent representations for missing modalities.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, with comprehensive ablation studies validating effectiveness.

Conclusion: PROMISE effectively bridges the representational gap between complete and incomplete multimodal data through its innovative prompt-attention hierarchical contrastive learning approach.

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

TL;DR: EmoVid is the first multimodal emotion-annotated video dataset for creative media, enabling emotion-conditioned video generation that significantly improves visual quality and emotional expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation systems focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions, and there's a lack of dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks in stylized and non-realistic contexts.

Method: Created EmoVid dataset with cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes, and text captions. Developed emotion-conditioned video generation by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model.

Result: Significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. Uncovered spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions.

Conclusion: EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing, providing valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos and practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

### [102] [MeCaMIL: Causality-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Fair and Interpretable Whole Slide Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11004)
*Yiran Song,Yikai Zhang,Shuang Zhou,Guojun Xiong,Xiaofeng Yang,Nian Wang,Fenglong Ma,Rui Zhang,Mingquan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeCaMIL is a causality-aware multiple instance learning framework for whole slide image analysis that addresses fairness concerns by explicitly modeling demographic confounders using causal graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved fairness across diverse populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods for pathology analysis lack causal interpretability and fail to integrate patient demographics, leading to fairness concerns and algorithmic bias that can exacerbate health disparities in clinical applications.

Method: MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference using structured causal graphs, do-calculus, and collider structures to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations, treating demographics as confounders rather than auxiliary features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-Lung, TCGA-Multi) with ACC/AUC/F1 scores up to 0.977/0.993/0.970, reduces demographic disparity variance by over 65% on average, and improves survival prediction (C-index: 0.653).

Conclusion: MeCaMIL establishes a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology, with causal graph structure being essential for both performance and fairness improvements.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DnR framework uses a question-conditioned utilization metric to measure and improve LVLMs' visual grounding, reducing hallucinations by guiding refinement with external visual experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce ungrounded responses due to over-reliance on linguistic priors rather than visual evidence, highlighting the need for quantitative measurement of visual information utilization.

Method: Proposes Draft and Refine (DnR) agent framework with question-conditioned utilization metric that constructs relevance maps and measures visual dependence through probabilistic masking, then refines responses using external visual experts' outputs rendered as visual cues.

Result: Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination.

Conclusion: Measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

TL;DR: VisMem is a cognitive memory framework for Vision-Language Models that adds short-term visual memory and long-term semantic memory to overcome visual processing bottlenecks, improving performance by 11.8% on average across visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from visual processing bottlenecks where they lose grounding in visual evidence and lack contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation, inspired by human cognitive memory theory.

Method: Proposes VisMem framework with dynamic latent vision memories: short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation, seamlessly invoked during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show VisMem delivers 11.8% average performance boost relative to vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation.

Conclusion: VisMem establishes a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement in VLMs, maintaining both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard is a selective guidance method for diffusion-based text-to-image models that improves safety by adaptively estimating prompt harmfulness and applying guidance only to unsafe image regions, outperforming existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based T2I models enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack adaptivity (adjusting guidance strength based on prompt) and selectivity (targeting only unsafe regions).

Method: SP-Guard estimates prompt harmfulness and applies a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas of the image, providing both adaptivity and selectivity.

Result: Experiments show SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.

Conclusion: Beyond improving safety, the findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUPER (Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction) is a plug-and-play decoder block that uses wavelet perfect reconstruction to prevent information loss in U-Net architectures, improving high-frequency detail recovery in inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) suffer from information loss that limits recovery of fine high-frequency details in inverse problems.

Method: Exploits perfect reconstruction property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing redundant features. Serves as plug-and-play decoder block for U-Net variants without rigid framelet constraints.

Result: Markedly improves thin-crack segmentation (especially cracks <4 px) on CrackVision12K, achieves moderate PSNR gains in smartphone image denoising on SIDD. Maintains comparable computational cost while enriching representational diversity.

Conclusion: SUPER provides plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified reconstruction-aware framework, robust across both low- and high-frequency regimes.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AirCopBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging conditions, featuring 14.6k+ questions across four task dimensions and revealing significant performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception in MLLMs, despite multi-drone systems offering enhanced coverage and robustness compared to single-sensor setups. Existing benchmarks focus on basic perception tasks and fail to address complex egocentric collaborative scenarios under real-world degraded conditions.

Method: The authors created AirCopBench using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events. They generated large-scale questions (14.6k+) through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control, spanning simulator and real-world data across four task dimensions and 14 task types.

Result: Evaluations on 40 MLLMs revealed significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and showing inconsistent results across different tasks. Fine-tuning experiments confirmed the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: AirCopBench addresses the critical gap in multi-agent collaborative perception evaluation and demonstrates that current MLLMs still have substantial room for improvement in complex collaborative scenarios, while also validating the potential for sim-to-real knowledge transfer in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

TL;DR: EmbryoDiff is a diffusion-based framework for fine-grained embryo stage classification in IVF that uses multi-focal feature fusion and hybrid semantic-boundary conditioning to improve accuracy under cell occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for embryo stage classification fail to utilize developmental priors and rely on single-focal information, leading to incomplete representations and feature ambiguity under cell occlusions.

Method: Two-stage diffusion framework: 1) Train frame-level encoder for multi-focal features, 2) Use Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy to create 3D-aware representations, then apply Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block in diffusion denoising process.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on two benchmark datasets using only a single denoising step.

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging developmental priors and multi-focal information, demonstrating superior performance in embryo stage classification.

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: Deep learning models can predict patients' health insurance type (a socioeconomic proxy) from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy, revealing embedded social inequality signals in medical imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether medical AI models can detect invisible traces of social inequality and socioeconomic status from medical images, challenging the assumption that medical images are purely neutral biological data.

Method: Used state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) trained on chest X-rays from MIMIC-CXR-JPG and CheXpert datasets, with patch-based occlusion analysis to localize signals and controlled analyses for age, race, and sex.

Result: Models achieved AUC around 0.67-0.68 for predicting health insurance type, with signal persisting across demographic controls and racial groups. Signal was diffuse rather than localized, embedded in upper and mid-thoracic regions.

Conclusion: Medical AI models internalize subtle traces of clinical environments and socioeconomic segregation, requiring a reframing of fairness beyond dataset balancing to interrogate and disentangle social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) to improve efficiency of controllable generative models by using coarse-grained block-level cache and fine-grained prompt-level cache to reduce computational overhead while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable generative models face computational efficiency challenges due to handling control conditions and content generation requirements, resulting in low generation efficiency.

Method: Uses two-level cache strategy: (1) coarse-grained block-level cache for feature reuse in encoder-decoder blocks, (2) fine-grained prompt-level cache for reusing cross-attention maps within modules and adjacent steps.

Result: On COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, reduces computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T) while keeping semantic fidelity loss within 1.5%. Validated on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HGC effectively balances generation efficiency and visual quality, significantly reducing computational overhead with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

TL;DR: MPCGNet introduces coupling gates and three specialized modules to improve polyp segmentation by addressing noise filtering, feature selection, and small polyp detection challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome key challenges in polyp segmentation: missed small polyps, ambiguous boundaries, and noise from uneven lighting in colonoscopy images.

Method: Proposes coupling gates for noise filtering and feature selection, with three modules: CGMFE for local feature extraction and noise suppression, WCAD decoder for detail restoration, and DFA for progressive feature aggregation and importance selection.

Result: Outperforms recent networks with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than second-best on ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed MPCGNet with coupling gates effectively addresses polyp segmentation challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: CrossMed is a benchmark for evaluating compositional generalization in medical multimodal LLMs using a Modality-Anatomy-Task schema, showing significant performance drops in unrelated and zero-overlap scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well multimodal LLMs can generalize across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type in medical AI applications.

Method: Reformulated four public medical datasets into unified VQA format, created Related/Unrelated splits and zero-overlap settings, and evaluated LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B models.

Result: Models achieved 83.2% classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU on Related splits, but performance dropped significantly in Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions. Cross-task transfer improved segmentation by 7% cIoU.

Conclusion: CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating compositional generalization in medical vision-language models, demonstrating multimodal LLMs' unique capability for zero-shot and cross-task generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Motivation: Enable AI on resource-constrained IoT devices through resilient device-edge collaboration, addressing limitations of traditional bit-level error correction approaches that are inefficient under dynamic channel conditions.

Method: Proposes SemanticNN with BER-aware decoder for dynamic channel adaptation, Soft Quantization encoder for compact representations, Feature-augmentation Learning for offloading efficiency, and XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation for decoder enhancement.

Result: Extensive experiments on STM32 with three models and six datasets show SemanticNN reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy under varying transmission error rates.

Conclusion: SemanticNN enables compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements for IoT AI applications.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

TL;DR: H²ARN addresses text-3D retrieval challenges using hyperbolic space embeddings to preserve hierarchical relationships and reduce redundancy, achieving superior performance on an expanded benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-3D retrieval methods suffer from Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD), which compress hierarchical structures and dilute semantic cues in Euclidean embeddings.

Method: Proposes Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H²ARN) using Lorentz-model hyperbolic space embeddings, hierarchical ordering loss, instance-level contrastive loss, and contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation.

Result: The method effectively preserves hierarchical distances and enhances discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy, demonstrated on the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark with 8,935 text-3D pairs.

Conclusion: H²ARN successfully addresses HRC and RISD challenges through hyperbolic geometry, providing a robust framework for text-3D retrieval with improved hierarchical reasoning and redundancy reduction.

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

TL;DR: PINGS-X is a novel framework using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations for 4D flow MRI super-resolution, achieving faster training and superior accuracy compared to physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of cardiovascular conditions, but achieving this resolution leads to prolonged scan times. Existing PINN-based methods have slow training that must be performed for each patient, limiting practical applicability.

Method: PINGS-X extends 3D Gaussian splatting with three innovations: normalized Gaussian splatting with convergence guarantee, axes-aligned Gaussians for high-dimensional data, and Gaussian merging for computational efficiency and preventing degenerate solutions.

Result: Experimental results on CFD and real 4D flow MRI datasets show PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PINGS-X provides an efficient and accurate solution for 4D flow MRI super-resolution, overcoming the limitations of slow training in patient-specific PINN approaches while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NP-LoRA is a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that prevents structural interference by enforcing subspace separation among principal directions, improving fusion quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods suffer from weight-based merging where one LoRA dominates the other, causing interference and degraded fidelity due to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations in low-rank subspaces.

Method: Extract principal style directions via SVD, project subject LoRA into orthogonal null space, and use soft projection mechanism for smooth control over subject fidelity vs style consistency trade-off.

Result: NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines across DINO and CLIP metrics, human and LLM preference scores, and works broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed NP-LoRA framework effectively prevents structural interference in LoRA fusion through subspace separation, enabling high-quality controllable generation without costly retraining.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-reference generative image composition model with feature calibration to improve detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative image composition methods struggle with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment.

Method: Extends generative composition model to multi-reference version and calibrates global/local features of foreground references to make them compatible with background information.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom show the model greatly benefits from calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-reference approach with feature calibration effectively improves generative image composition performance.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteAttention exploits temporal coherence in diffusion attention patterns to enable evolutionary computation skips, eliminating redundant attention computations while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers for video generation suffer from quadratic attention complexity causing prohibitive latency, with existing acceleration methods facing trade-offs between computational overhead and suboptimal static patterns.

Method: Leverages temporal coherence of attention sparsity patterns across denoising steps, marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward without repeated profiling overheads.

Result: Substantial speedups on production video diffusion models with no degradation in quality, implemented as optimized kernel on top of FlashAttention.

Conclusion: LiteAttention combines adaptivity of dynamic methods with efficiency of static ones by exploiting temporal coherence in diffusion attention patterns.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

*Jiechao Gao,Chang Liu,Yuangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2D-Align is a novel SFT paradigm for radiology report generation that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment using auxiliary signals of varying granularities through a shallow-to-deep strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment in radiology report generation due to instance-level alignment only, leading to sub-optimal generation quality from templated reports.

Method: Proposes S2D-Align with shallow-to-deep strategy: starts with coarse radiograph-report pairing, adds reference reports for instance-level guidance, and uses key phrases for anatomical grounding. Includes memory-based adapter for feature sharing between alignment stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray benchmarks. Ablation studies validate effectiveness of multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach.

Conclusion: S2D-Align enhances grounding capabilities in complex multi-modal generation tasks and represents a promising direction for improving radiology report generation.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

TL;DR: Comparison of diffusion models and autoregressive transformers for 3D shape generation and completion, showing diffusion models excel with continuous latents while autoregressive models match performance in discrete latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of consensus on best generative models for 3D data tasks, and insufficient evaluation of conditional information like partial 3D data for steering generation processes.

Method: Adapted Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers for generative shape modeling and completion, with thorough quantitative evaluation including baseline discriminative model and ablation study.

Result: Diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms discriminative model and autoregressive approach for shape completion from noisy depth images; autoregressive model matches diffusion performance in same discrete latent space.

Conclusion: Both diffusion and autoregressive models show strong performance on 3D shape tasks, with diffusion excelling in continuous latent spaces and autoregressive models performing competitively in discrete latent spaces.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Motivation: Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data for realistic liquid behaviors under dynamic scenarios, which is crucial for autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks.

Method: Created a physics-informed dataset with simulation images and 3D meshes across multiple scenarios, and proposed a four-stage pipeline involving segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D reconstruction, and real-world scaling.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Phys-Liquid dataset and validation methods facilitate advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

In our experiments, we consider well-posed cases where the data are sufficient for accurate reconstruction without the need for regularization. We achieve higher reconstruction quality than traditional voxel-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical weather prediction models are computationally expensive and perform poorly at nowcasting timescales (0-4 hours), while existing AI weather prediction approaches haven't fully explored video-understanding architectures.

Method: Built a video transformer with full space-time attention, reformulated precipitation regression as classification, and used class-weighted loss to handle imbalanced datasets.

Result: The model achieved first place in the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge.

Conclusion: SaTformer demonstrates the effectiveness of video transformers for extreme precipitation forecasting from satellite data, with techniques to address dataset imbalances.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based Agatston scoring is the gold standard for CAC detection but is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays lack reliable ground truth labels, limiting deep learning development.

Method: Generate synthetic DRRs from CT scans, evaluate model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies including curriculum learning. Use lightweight CNNs trained from scratch rather than large pretrained networks.

Result: Best configuration achieves mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. Pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains, and curriculum learning stabilizes training under weak supervision.

Conclusion: DRRs establish a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection and lay groundwork for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Motivation: Bark beetle infestations pose serious threats to coniferous forest health, requiring effective monitoring methods.

Method: Contrastive learning framework pre-trains 1D CNN encoder to extract robust features from hyperspectral data, then uses support vector regression estimators trained on few labeled samples to estimate tree health proportions per pixel.

Result: Outperforms original PRISMA spectral bands and Sentinel-2 data in experiments conducted in the Dolomites study area.

Conclusion: PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning provides significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

Abstract: Bark beetle infestations represent a serious challenge for maintaining the health of coniferous forests. This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate that PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning offers significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

Motivation: Extending reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) from text to video language models is challenging, and existing approaches don't adequately model the distinct processes of perception and reasoning in video understanding.

Method: Two-stage framework: SFT stage creates VideoP2R-CoT-162K dataset with process-aware chain-of-thought annotations; RL stage uses novel PA-GRPO algorithm with separate rewards for perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: Process-aware modeling of perception and reasoning significantly enhances video reasoning capabilities, and perception outputs contain sufficient information for downstream reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper reviews 24 recent works on AI-generated media detection, identifies common limitations of current approaches, and suggests multimodal deep learning as a promising research direction for more robust detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI-generated media (GANs, diffusion models) has made it difficult to distinguish real from synthetic content, leading to misuse for misinformation, privacy violations, and fraud, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive review of 24 recent works on AI-generated media detection, examining each individually to identify contributions and weaknesses, then summarizing common limitations and challenges.

Result: Current detection approaches using CNNs and ViTs often fail to generalize across unseen data, struggle with content from different models, and are ineffective for multimodal data and highly modified content.

Conclusion: Multimodal deep learning models are suggested as a promising research direction to provide more robust and generalized detection against harmful synthetic media, offering future researchers a clear starting point.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vectorized glyphs are essential for scalable design applications, and leveraging LLMs' sequence prediction capabilities for stroke-based character generation can enable flexible vector glyph creation.

Method: Encode strokes into discrete latent embeddings, fine-tune DeepSeek LLM to predict next stroke embeddings, and generate complete characters from limited stroke inputs.

Result: The model generates complete characters, elegant words, and unseen verses in vector form, demonstrates scaling behavior with data, and creates a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset with 907,267 samples.

Conclusion: LVGM successfully bridges LLM capabilities with vector glyph generation, providing a scalable solution for Chinese character creation with expert-validated results.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Conclusion: HinD effectively elicits and harnesses internal knowledge reasoning in MLLMs, providing explicit multi-step reasoning for KBVQA.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

*Zhanpeng Wang,Shuting Cao,Yuhang Lu,Yuhan Li,Na Lei,Zhongxuan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-ALD is an improved image-to-image translation framework that uses optimal transport theory to fix latent distribution mismatches in DDIB methods, achieving 20.29% faster sampling and 2.6 FID score reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key challenges in DDIB methods: low translation efficiency and translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions between source and target domains.

Method: Compute an optimal transport map from source to target latent distributions, then use the mapped distribution as starting point for reverse diffusion in target domain, eliminating distribution mismatches.

Result: 20.29% improvement in sampling efficiency and average 2.6 reduction in FID score across four translation tasks on three high-resolution datasets compared to top-performing baselines.

Conclusion: OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved quality by eliminating latent distribution mismatches through optimal transport theory, while retaining DDIB's cycle consistency and flexibility.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

### [132] [Reverberation: Learning the Latencies Before Forecasting Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11164)
*Conghao Wong,Ziqian Zou,Beihao Xia,Xinge You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reverberation-based trajectory prediction model that explicitly learns and predicts agent latencies in responding to trajectory-changing events, improving causal continuity and trajectory plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction methods struggle to explicitly model temporal delays (latencies) that agents exhibit when responding to trajectory-changing events, which can undermine causal continuity and lead to implausible predictions.

Method: Proposes a reverberation transform and Reverberation (Rev) model using two explicit, learnable reverberation kernels to simulate and predict different latency preferences of each agent, inspired by reverberation curves in acoustics.

Result: Experiments on multiple pedestrian and vehicle datasets show competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios.

Conclusion: The reverberation transform effectively models agent latencies, enabling controllable trajectory prediction and serving as a general latency modeling approach with interpretable dynamics.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD is a lightweight convolutional framework for explainable multi-type anomaly detection that uses image-level labels to produce multi-channel heatmaps, with each channel corresponding to a specific anomaly type, achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable anomaly detection methods lack the capability to differentiate anomaly types and require separate models for each object category, while large-scale VLMs are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time or embedded systems.

Method: A simple convolutional framework that uses only image-level labels to learn multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel corresponds to a specific anomaly type, functioning as a unified framework across multiple object categories.

Result: Evaluated on Real-IAD dataset, delivers competitive results with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times.

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD provides a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications with constrained computational resources, eliminating the need for separate models per object category.

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Conclusion: CATS-V2V is the largest, most comprehensive, and highest-quality V2V cooperative perception dataset for complex adverse scenarios, expected to benefit the autonomous driving community.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

*Ayush Pandey,Jai Bardhan,Ishita Jain,Ramya S Hebbalaguppe,Rohan Raju Dhanakshirur,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignVQA is a debate-based multi-agent framework that improves confidence calibration in Visual Question Answering systems by having specialized VLMs generate answers and engage in critique/refinement interactions, with a novel calibration-aware loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQA systems are increasingly used in high-stakes domains but often produce overconfident responses, with reliability of confidence estimates remaining under-examined despite improved accuracy.

Method: Multi-agent framework with specialized VLMs using distinct prompting strategies, engaging in two-stage interaction (critique, refine, aggregate) and using a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function (aligncal) to minimize calibration error upper bound.

Result: Substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies across multiple benchmark VQA datasets, with more calibrated specialized agents producing better aligned confidences.

Conclusion: The debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect true predictive performance, and the calibration-aware loss function effectively improves fidelity of individual agents' confidence estimates.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

*Zhixin Xu,Hengyu Zhou,Yuan Liu,Wenhan Xue,Hao Pan,Wenping Wang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A temporal alignment strategy for 4D Gaussian Splatting that handles unsynchronized multi-view videos through coarse-to-fine time shift estimation and compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view videos often suffer from temporal misalignment due to camera trigger delays or independent recording, which degrades 4DGS reconstruction quality.

Method: Coarse-to-fine alignment module that first estimates frame-level offsets then refines to sub-frame accuracy, designed as an integrable module for existing 4DGS frameworks.

Result: Effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed temporal alignment strategy improves 4DGS robustness for asynchronous multi-view video data while maintaining integration compatibility.

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

TL;DR: Viper-F1 is an efficient multimodal language model that replaces attention with state-space dynamics for linear-time inference while maintaining fine-grained visual understanding through token-grid correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have high computational costs that limit deployment in resource-constrained scenarios, and small models struggle with fine-grained visual reasoning tasks due to inefficient cross-attention mechanisms.

Method: Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model using Liquid State-Space Dynamics instead of attention, plus Token-Grid Correlation Module that computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches with FiLM conditioning.

Result: Achieves accurate fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency across multiple benchmarks, maintaining linear-time inference while selectively emphasizing relevant visual regions.

Conclusion: Viper-F1 provides an effective solution for efficient multimodal understanding in resource-constrained environments by combining state-space dynamics with visual grounding mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Conclusion: Compact specialized deep learning models are effective for short-range pollution forecasts on limited spatial domains, enabling rapid inference with improved accuracy.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Motivation: To develop an effective short-term rainfall prediction system for weather forecasting competitions using limited input data (single infrared channel).

Method: Two-stage training: first stage trains ConvGRU to forecast brightness temperatures from SEVIRI data, second stage applies nonlinear transformation to predict rainfall rates. Event prediction uses 3D detection and feature extraction.

Conclusion: The transfer learning framework with ConvGRU effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns for rainfall prediction using minimal input data, demonstrating strong competition performance.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate VLM robustness to benign input changes that preserve semantics, as current understanding of their reliability under such perturbations is limited.

Method: Large-scale study across multiple models and datasets using various perturbations: pixel-level shifts, geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites.

Result: VLMs show significant instability - substantial fraction of samples change predicted answers under perturbations. Stable samples are consistently more likely to be correct, and stability patterns from small models can predict correctness of larger models with high precision.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit fundamental fragility to minor input changes, highlighting the need for robustness evaluations focusing on semantic invariances rather than just adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Result: Achieved high attack success rates (up to 100%) across multiple datasets and model architectures while maintaining accuracy on clean data, systematically validating the one-to-N backdoor concept.

Conclusion: Establishes crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems against sophisticated backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of data scarcity in medical imaging by creating a unified framework that allows foundation models to expand into multiple domains and modalities without requiring separate models for each task.

Method: Proposes MAFM^3 framework with modular components that serve as specialized skill sets, allowing flexible activation of appropriate capabilities at inference time based on input type or clinical objective.

Result: Improved performance on both prognosis and segmentation tasks, with PET scan integration achieving 5% Dice score improvement compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Foundation models equipped with modular components can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging, overcoming inherent training scope constraints.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

TL;DR: GSD framework uses Video Diffusion Models to provide multi-view consistency priors for 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing overfitting in sparse view scenarios through unified guidance with depth and semantic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting overfits with sparse training views due to lack of intermediate-view supervision, requiring rich multi-view consistency priors from generative models.

Method: Proposes Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) that supervises rendered images from multiple views using Video Diffusion Models, with unified guidance incorporating depth warp and semantic features to correct noise prediction and ensure proper camera pose alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets, demonstrating improved performance in sparse view scenarios.

Conclusion: GSD effectively leverages Video Diffusion Models to provide multi-view consistency supervision for 3D Gaussian Splatting, overcoming overfitting issues in sparse view settings through unified guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

### [145] [Positional Bias in Multimodal Embedding Models: Do They Favor the Beginning, the Middle, or the End?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11216)
*Kebin Wu,Fatima Albreiki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates positional bias in multimodal representation models, particularly in image-text retrieval, showing that text encoders favor the beginning of inputs while image encoders favor both beginning and end positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias negatively impacts model performance, but its presence in representation models and multimodal models remains underexplored compared to text generation models.

Method: The study distinguishes between context importance and positional bias, then assesses positional bias across different models and datasets in multimodal representation models, specifically for image-text retrieval.

Result: Positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models with different patterns across modalities: text encoders show bias toward input beginnings, while image encoders show bias at both beginning and end positions.

Conclusion: Positional bias in multimodal models arises from a combination of factors including positional encoding schemes, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

*Abiram Panchalingam,Indu Bodala,Stuart Middleton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT-Gaze enhances 3D gaze redirection using Diffusion Transformers, weak supervision with synthetic intermediate gaze angles, and orthogonality constraints to disentangle gaze, head pose, and expression representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity gaze redirection is needed to generate augmented data for improving gaze estimator generalization, as current 3D Gaussian Splatting models struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts.

Method: Combines Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for higher-fidelity synthesis, weak supervision using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles to create smooth gaze manifolds, and orthogonality constraint loss to mathematically enforce disentanglement of gaze, head pose, and expression representations.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze provides a superior method for creating synthetic training data for gaze estimation tasks, with code and models to be made available for research community benchmarking.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

### [147] [DoReMi: A Domain-Representation Mixture Framework for Generalizable 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11232)
*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi is a Mixture-of-Experts framework that jointly models domain-aware experts and unified representations to address multi-domain 3D point cloud learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like ScanNet and S3DIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D deep learning faces limitations due to small datasets and heterogeneity in multi-source point clouds from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR vs mesh-derived), causing negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Existing approaches overlook the synergy between domain-aware and domain-general features.

Method: Proposes DoReMi with Domain-aware Experts branch and unified Representation branch. Uses Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable expert utilization. Includes frozen unified representation branch pretrained through multi-attribute self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DoReMi shows strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research by effectively modeling diverse domain distributions while preserving cross-domain geometric and structural priors.

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

*Cong Cao,Yujie Xu,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a few-shot style editing framework using MoE LoRA with routing mechanisms for efficient multi-style fine-tuning with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General image editing models often fail with new styles, and there's a need to effectively fine-tune them using limited paired data for different styles.

Method: Uses parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing, automatic rank determination, optimal LoRA insertion in DiT model, and integrates adversarial learning and flow matching.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters, as demonstrated on a benchmark dataset with five distinct styles.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses few-shot style editing by combining efficient parameter adaptation, automatic rank optimization, and enhanced training techniques.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

*Zhongbin Guo,Jiahe Liu,Yushan Li,Wenyu Gao,Zhen Yang,Chenzhi Li,Xinyue Zhang,Ping Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEODE is a novel VLM architecture that addresses 3D spatial reasoning limitations by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation through two plug-and-play modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 1.5B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with 3D spatial intelligence due to input-stage conflicts between geometric-aware encoders and 2D features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers cannot produce precise continuous numerical values.

Method: GEODE uses two specialized modules: DRM (Decoupled Rationale Module) that aligns 3D data with 2D features via cross-attention and distills spatial logic into Rationale Tokens, and DRH (Direct Regression Head) that uses an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm with lightweight MLP for precise continuous regression.

Result: The 1.5B parameter GEODE model achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models, functioning as a high-level semantic dispatcher.

Conclusion: GEODE successfully breaks the dual-bottleneck in VLMs for 3D spatial reasoning by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation, enabling efficient and precise spatial intelligence with minimal parameters.

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

*Jitesh Chavan,Rohit Lal,Anand Kamat,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arcee introduces cross-block recurrent state chains in Mamba models to preserve terminal state-space representations between blocks, improving vision tasks without added parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Mamba reinitializes state-space dynamics from zero for each block, discarding valuable terminal state information from previous blocks that could improve modeling.

Method: Arcee reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block via a differentiable boundary map that enables end-to-end gradient flow.

Result: On CelebA-HQ (256×256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduced FID from 82.81 to 15.33 (5.4× improvement) on a Zigzag Mamba baseline.

Conclusion: Preserving terminal state-space representations across blocks via differentiable boundary maps significantly improves vision Mamba models with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.

TL;DR: A novel AI framework for gaze target detection in autistic children using social context to address class imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quality of life for autistic children by enabling automatic gaze target detection, which is foundational for measuring joint attention - a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Method: Proposed Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) framework with two-pathway architecture using expert models for social and non-social gaze, guided by context-awareness gate module. Uses the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in autistic children, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses class imbalance in autism datasets and provides an effective solution for automated gaze target detection in autistic children.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

### [152] [Discovering Meaningful Units with Visually Grounded Semantics from Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11262)
*Melika Behjati,James Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a vision-language model that groups caption tokens to capture fine-grained language representations, aligning them with object-level image features for better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models align image patches with individual tokens, but patches lack semantic meaning and tokens don't necessarily correspond to groundable image information. Groups of tokens better describe scene aspects.

Method: Develop a model that groups caption tokens as part of its architecture to create fine-grained language representations, then align these representations with object-level features from an image encoder trained for object discovery.

Result: The model achieves better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. The discovered token groups are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Learning to group tokens enables vision-language models to capture more meaningful, fine-grained representations that align better with object-level visual understanding, improving overall multimodal comprehension.

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountSteer is a training-free method that improves text-to-image models' ability to follow numerical instructions by steering cross-attention hidden states during inference, based on the observation that models have latent awareness of their own counting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation, despite having implicit awareness of their own counting accuracy through internal signals.

Method: CountSteer steers the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference to guide generation more precisely, leveraging the model's latent notion of numerical correctness without requiring additional training.

Result: CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality in experiments.

Conclusion: CountSteer demonstrates a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation by harnessing models' implicit numerical awareness.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve vision-language models for autonomous driving by conditioning them on traffic scene graphs, resulting in significant performance improvements without requiring scene graphs at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for autonomous driving lack explicit supervision for relational dependencies between traffic entities, limiting their ability to understand spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input.

Method: A model-agnostic approach that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context using traffic scene graphs. Scene graphs are serialized at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporated via structured prompt templates.

Result: Extensive evaluations on LangAuto benchmark show large improvements: up to 15.6% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5% for BEVDriver. Models better internalize relational priors even without scene graph input at test-time.

Conclusion: Scene graph conditioning enables vision-language models to better understand and ground relational dependencies in traffic scenes, leading to substantial performance gains in autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

TL;DR: Φeat is a self-supervised visual backbone that learns physically-grounded representations sensitive to material identity by contrasting spatial crops and physical augmentations under varying shapes and lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors like geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning.

Method: Uses pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions, without explicit labels.

Result: Learned representations capture physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping, showing strong performance in feature similarity analysis and material selection tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

TL;DR: CORAL is a coordinative learning framework that captures local and global anatomical structure in volumetric medical images using contrastive ranking and ordinal objectives, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use hard binary thresholds for contrastive learning, discarding continuous anatomical similarity information and overlooking global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces.

Method: Proposes Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) with two objectives: 1) contrastive ranking to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring feature distances are proportional to anatomical position differences; 2) ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency across patients.

Result: CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings and learns representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Conclusion: Learning inter-slice relationships through coordinative learning produces anatomically informed representations that benefit downstream segmentation tasks, with the framework successfully capturing both local and global anatomical structure.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning VLMs with controlled synthetic data generation addresses bias and imbalance issues, improving performance on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning with real-world data often suffers from biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, leading to overfitting and imbalanced performance.

Method: Redesigned fine-tuning process with controlled synthetic data generation that comprehensively samples object attributes (color, shape, size, position) and uses this balanced dataset to fine-tune VLMs.

Result: Fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across visual scenes, mitigates biases, and significantly improves performance on real-world COCO data, outperforming models fine-tuned with matched real data.

Conclusion: Controlled synthetic data generation provides an effective solution to bias and imbalance issues in VLM fine-tuning, enabling better generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-GAP improves out-of-domain robustness by combining frequency-space and pixel-space augmentations guided by task gradients, outperforming both generic and dataset-specific methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle with domain shifts due to learning biases toward domain-specific frequency components, and existing frequency perturbation methods overlook pixel-level details.

Method: Computes sensitivity maps from task gradients in frequency space, adaptively interpolates amplitudes between source and target samples, and performs complementary pixel-space blending.

Result: Consistently outperforms generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: D-GAP effectively addresses domain shift challenges by reducing frequency bias while preserving spatial details, providing robust performance across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

TL;DR: DocLens is a multi-agent framework that uses tool augmentation to improve evidence localization in long visual documents by navigating from full documents to specific visual elements and employing sampling-adjudication for reliable answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with evidence localization in long visual documents, failing to retrieve relevant pages and missing fine-grained details, leading to poor performance and hallucinations.

Method: Tool-augmented multi-agent framework that navigates from full documents to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then uses sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate reliable answers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V with Gemini-2.5-Pro, surpassing human experts, especially on vision-centric and unanswerable queries.

Conclusion: DocLens demonstrates superior evidence localization capabilities through its multi-agent framework with enhanced navigation and adjudication mechanisms.

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark provides a more robust and generalized watermarking solution by leveraging the natural stability of low-frequency image components, eliminating the limitations of noise simulation-based approaches.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUVIC is a novel framework for visual concept unlearning in MLLMs that uses adversarial perturbations to precisely remove target concepts while preserving performance on related entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs trained on massive datasets raise privacy concerns due to sensitive/copyrighted content. Regulatory 'right to be forgotten' requirements and the high cost of retraining necessitate efficient unlearning methods, but visual concept unlearning remains underexplored.

Method: AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting of target visual concepts, effectively isolating the target while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities.

Result: AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates with minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts, as demonstrated on the VCUBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed AUVIC framework successfully addresses the challenge of precise visual concept unlearning in MLLMs while maintaining model performance on related concepts.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

TL;DR: This paper presents a 6D pose estimation system for strawberries using synthetic data from a procedural Blender pipeline, achieving comparable accuracy on both high-end and edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in automated fruit harvesting due to high costs and labor shortages in advanced economies, particularly the need for accurate pose estimation without extensive real-world training data.

Method: Uses YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm with synthetic data generated through a procedural Blender pipeline that enhances realism compared to previous work, enabling training without real-world data.

Result: Models achieve comparable accuracy on both NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across ADD-S metrics, with RTX 3090 having superior speed but Jetson Orin Nano being suitable for resource-constrained agricultural robotics. Performs well on ripe and partially ripe strawberries but struggles with unripe specimens.

Conclusion: The methodology is effective for strawberry pose estimation using purely synthetic data and can be adapted for other fruits like apples, peaches, and plums, with future improvements needed for better detection of unripe strawberries through color variations.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models have strong multimodal reasoning but high memory footprint, making them impractical for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Uses Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor to encode visual, textual, and layout info into fixed-length sequences, and Streaming Abstention mechanism with entropy-based uncertainty calibration for sequential processing of long documents.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82% fewer visual tokens, 75% fewer parameters, and 71% lower latency across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks.

Conclusion: DocSLM delivers reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices with significantly reduced resource requirements.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of comprehensive synthetic datasets for event-based vision comparable to those available for frame-based computer vision.

Method: Generated 50,000 event sequences using Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following BOP methodology, with simulated linear camera motion for complete scene coverage.

Result: Time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, significantly outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives, with polarity information contributing most to performance gains.

Conclusion: The dataset provides structured event-camera data with optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking in event-based vision.

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D generates realistic 3D human motions without 3D annotations by using 2D motion data and enforcing 3D consistency through regularization objectives, achieving comparable or better performance than 3D-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D motion generation models rely on precise 3D supervision, which limits generalization beyond training distributions by encouraging models to fit coordinate patterns rather than learning essential 3D structure and motion semantics.

Method: Proposes Free3D framework with Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences to 3D-consistent latent spaces, and uses 3D-free regularization objectives for view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility.

Result: Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions with performance comparable to or surpassing fully 3D-supervised methods, despite being trained only on 2D motion data.

Conclusion: Relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation methods lack accuracy or speed, while supervised CNNs require large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches have slow segmentation times and lower accuracy. The goal is to leverage advantages from both areas.

Method: Integration of HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, investigating different neighborhood terms and components for unsupervised HMRF loss. Also proposes a pre-training strategy to reduce ground-truth data requirements.

Result: HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on Micro-CT images of Polyurethane foam structures. The pre-training strategy considerably reduces required ground-truth data.

Conclusion: The hybrid HMRF-UNet approach successfully combines unsupervised learning with fast segmentation times, achieving state-of-the-art performance for material microstructure analysis without extensive labeled data.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

TL;DR: LSEF is a hierarchical framework that disentangles emotional bases and transient fluctuations using low-rank sparse modeling to improve video affective computing stability and discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based Affective Computing suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics, lacking mechanisms to separate long-term emotional tones from short-term fluctuations.

Method: Proposes LSEF with three modules: Stability Encoding Module (captures low-rank emotional bases), Dynamic Decoupling Module (isolates sparse transient signals), and Consistency Integration Module (reconstructs multi-scale coherence), optimized by Rank Aware Optimization strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination in affective computing.

Conclusion: The hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling approach effectively addresses affective dynamics understanding, validating the framework's effectiveness and generality.

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data for scientific reasoning in microscopy, which limits the application of Multimodal Large Language Models to biomedical imaging.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Bootstrap supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs; 2) Apply HiCQA-Graph for cross-modal consistency filtering using NLI, CLIP, and agent signals; 3) Use MLLM agent to generate MCQs followed by human screening.

Conclusion: Careful data construction through expert literature coupling, graph-based filtering, and human refinement enables smaller MLLMs to achieve competitive microscopy reasoning performance, providing a quality-controlled dataset and novel graph modeling approach for cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Motivation: The potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models for Document Image Quality Assessment remains underexplored despite their advancement in vision tasks.

Method: Three-tiered evaluation: coarse level (quality scoring), middle level (distortion-type identification), and fine level (distortion-severity assessment) with Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Result: MLLMs show nascent DIQA abilities but critical limitations including inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Chain-of-Thought prompting substantially enhances performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark revealing MLLMs' deficiencies in quality perception and identifies promising enhancement pathways through Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA is a parameter-free CIL framework that adapts CLIP's bridge-layer with orthogonal low-rank fusion to prevent forgetting and uses cross-modal hybrid prototypes for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apply CLIP to CIL without adding parameters or suffering from forgetting, while better integrating visual and textual modalities.

Method: Confine adaptation to CLIP's bridge-layer using Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion to constrain updates to a safe subspace orthogonal to past tasks, and employ cross-modal hybrid prototypes.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and efficiency on standard benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BOFA enables effective CIL with CLIP by leveraging its existing architecture and preventing forgetting through orthogonal constraints, without data replay.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

### [172] [Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422)
*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive teaching paradigm for EEG-vision alignment that addresses the fundamental asymmetry between modalities by having the vision modality dynamically adapt to EEG's limited capacity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in brain-to-image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal alignment methods treat vision and EEG as equal partners, ignoring the fundamental asymmetry characterized by Fidelity Gap (EEG's noise vs vision's high-fidelity) and Semantic Gap (EEG's shallow representation vs vision's rich semantics), leading to poor generalization.

Method: Proposes adaptive teaching paradigm where the vision modality (teacher) dynamically shrinks and adjusts its knowledge structure to match EEG's (student) capacity. Implements this with ShrinkAdapter - a residual-free bottleneck module that adapts vision features to EEG's learning capability.

Result: Achieves 60.2% top-1 accuracy on zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by 9.8%. Extensive experiments validate the paradigm's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher modality must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap, rather than forcing equal partnership between fundamentally asymmetric modalities.

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Motivation: To address the English-centric nature of REC research and meet global deployment demands by enabling multilingual visual grounding systems.

Method: Constructed a unified multilingual dataset through machine translation and context-based enhancement, and developed an attention-anchored architecture that generates spatial anchors from attention distributions and refines them with learned residuals.

Result: Achieved 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation (vs 91.3% English-only), with consistent performance across 10 languages using approximately 8 million multilingual expressions across 177,620 images.

Conclusion: Establishes practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems with competitive performance across multiple languages, providing a dataset and model for future multilingual REC research.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems. The dataset and model are available at $\href{https://multilingual.franreno.com}{multilingual.franreno.com}$.

TL;DR: WEAVE is a comprehensive suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation, consisting of WEAVE-100k dataset and WEAVEBench benchmark to address the limitations of single-turn interactions in existing multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing, creating a gap in evaluating unified multimodal models.

Method: Developed WEAVE-100k dataset with 100K interleaved samples spanning 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, and WEAVEBench with 100 tasks based on 480 images using a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework.

Result: Training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities, while evaluations on WEAVEBench expose persistent limitations of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation.

Conclusion: WEAVE provides a foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation, addressing the need for multi-turn, context-dependent evaluation in multimodal research.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [175] [The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to distinguish between recognition and realization of cultural references in text-to-image diffusion models, showing they often reproduce iconic structures even when textual cues change, with cultural alignment influenced by data frequency, uniqueness, popularity, and creation date.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, specifically focusing on multimodal iconicity where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, moving beyond simple forgetting to understand what is remembered and how.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework separating recognition (identifying references) from realization (depiction through replication or reinterpretation), evaluated five diffusion models on 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references using prompt perturbation experiments with synonym substitutions and literal descriptions.

Result: The framework distinguishes replication from transformation better than existing similarity methods; models often reproduce iconic visual structures despite altered textual cues; cultural alignment correlates with training data frequency, textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date.

Conclusion: Diffusion models' value lies not only in reproduction but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

*Guowei Zhang,Yun Zhao,Moein Khajehnejad,Adeel Razi,Levin Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM is a brain-inspired diffusion framework that explicitly models cortical hierarchy for fMRI-to-image reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art semantic performance while maintaining low-level fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based fMRI decoders overlook the brain's hierarchical visual processing by directly conditioning on fMRI features without analyzing cortical organization, which blurs the roles of different visual areas.

Method: Uses ROI adapter to group fMRI into early/mid/late streams, creates multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth, and employs depth-matched ControlNet to inject scale-specific hints during denoising.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD).

Conclusion: Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

TL;DR: VP-Bench is a new benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models' ability to perceive and use visual prompts (like bounding boxes) for referring questions in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack systematic evaluation for interpreting visual prompts, which are intuitive human methods for referring to specific image regions, making it unclear if models can effectively use this natural prompting approach.

Method: Two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 assesses VP perception using 30k visualized prompts across 8 shapes and 355 attribute combinations; Stage 2 evaluates VP impact on downstream tasks in real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 28 MLLMs (including GPT-4o, InternVL3, Qwen2.5-VL) revealed comprehensive insights into factors affecting VP understanding, such as VP attribute variations, question arrangement, and model scale.

Conclusion: VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions using visual prompts.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

TL;DR: Proposes MaMOL framework for robust multimodal classification with missing modalities using dual-routing mechanism and parameter-efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in multimodal remote sensing classification due to missing modalities from environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects. Existing methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training.

Method: Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework with dual-routing mechanism: task-oriented dynamic router for adaptive expert activation per missing pattern, and modality-specific-shared static router for stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Uses lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse for parameter efficiency.

Result: Superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates on multiple remote sensing benchmarks with minimal computational overhead. Transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate scalability and cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: MaMOL provides a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning, overcoming limitations of prior methods while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-domain transferability.

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

### [180] [Benchmarking Visual LLMs Resilience to Unanswerable Questions on Visually Rich Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11468)
*Davide Napolitano,Luca Cagliero,Fabrizio Battiloro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRD-UQA is a benchmark for evaluating Visual Large Language Models' ability to detect plausible yet unanswerable questions in Visually Rich Documents, revealing significant limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs excel at Visual Question Answering on multi-page VRDs but their capability to detect unanswerable questions remains an open research question, particularly for plausible questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions.

Method: The VRD-UQA benchmark automatically alters questions from existing VQA datasets by replacing original entities with related concepts from different document elements, layout positions, or pages, then verifies unanswerability using VLLM-as-a-judge approach.

Result: Experiments on 12 models reveal VLLMs' limitations in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels, with performance varying based on corruption type (NLP entity, document element, layout) and knowledge injection strategies.

Conclusion: VRD-UQA serves as an effective evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems, highlighting the need for improved robustness against plausible unanswerable questions in VLLMs.

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

*Yijie Kang,Xinliang Wang,Zhenyu Wu,Yifeng Shi,Hailong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2RealCity is a framework for generating realistic 3D cities from satellite imagery using entity-based generation, spatial priors, and appearance control, reducing dependency on costly 3D city assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D urban generation methods require expensive large-scale 3D city assets and rely on semantic/height maps that lack real-world appearance connections, limiting realism and generalizability.

Method: Uses OSM-based spatial priors for geometric generation, appearance-guided modeling for realism and style control, and MLLM-powered semantic-guided pipeline to bridge interpretation and reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show Sat2RealCity significantly outperforms baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, enabling real-world aligned 3D urban content creation.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a strong foundation for realistic 3D urban generation from satellite imagery with reduced dependency on costly 3D assets and improved appearance control.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have substantially enhanced 3D urban generation, enabling applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models suffer from randomness and inconsistency with vague prompts, while existing solutions require additional modules and lack test-time scaling efficiency.

Method: A unified multimodal agent with policy controller that enables multiple generation actions to dynamically interact and self-organize without external models.

Result: ImAgent consistently improves over backbone models and surpasses other baselines, especially where backbone models fail, in image generation and editing tasks.

Conclusion: Unified multimodal agents show potential for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Motivation: Current PD-L1 assessment methods using immunohistochemistry are resource-intensive, creating need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: Built on nnUNet-v2, uses cyclic training with model checkpoint sampling to approximate posterior distribution, enabling segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation.

Result: Achieved mean Dice Score of 0.805 and mean IoU of 0.709 on lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset, with uncertainty maps showing strong correlation with segmentation error.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is promising for scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: LVLMs often hallucinate objects by ignoring images and relying on previously generated tokens. The paper introduces PAS, a training-free attention-based score that detects hallucinations in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from object hallucinations where they generate objects not present in images, making them unreliable despite their capabilities.

Method: Proposed Prelim Attention Score (PAS) - a lightweight signal computed from attention weights over previously generated tokens, requiring no additional forward passes or training.

Result: PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Conclusion: Attention weights over previously generated tokens provide a powerful signal for detecting hallucinations, offering a practical solution for improving LVLM reliability.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound image interpretation is highly operator-dependent and varies across anatomical regions, protocols, and devices, with challenges like speckle, low contrast, and limited annotations hindering generalizable AI models.

Method: Uses vision Mamba backbone for local/global dependencies, novel self-adaptive masking combining contrastive learning with masked image modeling, dynamic learning schedule, and largest public ultrasound dataset (308K+ images from 42 datasets).

Result: Developed OpenUS foundation model that can be adapted to downstream tasks through label-efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: OpenUS provides a reproducible foundation model for ultrasound AI that addresses domain-specific challenges and enables efficient adaptation to various clinical applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between physical and digital chess experiences by providing real-time assistance for physical chess games, similar to what exists for online chess platforms.

Method: Uses a CNN with residual layers for piece recognition from smartphone images, involving image preprocessing with Hough Line Transform, projective transform for board alignment, segmentation into 64 squares, and classification into 13 piece classes.

Result: Trained and evaluated on Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD) with 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse conditions, achieving accurate piece classification and FEN string generation.

Conclusion: The system successfully converts physical chessboard images to FEN notation, enabling integration with chess engines to provide optimal move recommendations for physical chess games.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

TL;DR: BRIDGE proposes a lightweight fusion module using bidirectional cross-attention layers near the top of vision and text encoders to align modality-specific hidden states, achieving strong performance on retrieval, VQA, and reasoning tasks while maintaining bi-encoder efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs use either early fusion (mixing tokens/features) or late fusion (comparing pooled embeddings), often tied to autoregressive decoders. The authors argue that hidden states of both modalities already contain rich structure, so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what vision and text "think".

Method: A few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects vision and text encoder hidden states into shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back with stabilizers. Encoders remain non-causal for understanding, while generation is decoupled via optional decoder.

Result: BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight fusion module effectively aligns modality-specific hidden states, demonstrating strong performance on multiple vision-language tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

TL;DR: LARM is a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images, jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures using a transformer-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization-based reconstruction methods require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, while recent feedforward approaches produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle multi-stage pipelines.

Method: LARM extends LVSM (a novel view synthesis approach) to articulated objects by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture. It generates auxiliary outputs like depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation.

Result: LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to input images across diverse object categories.

Conclusion: LARM provides a scalable and accurate solution for 3D articulated object reconstruction from sparse-view images, eliminating the need for dense supervision while achieving high-fidelity results.

Abstract: Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous AI agents struggle with brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions on the web because they must infer affordances from human-oriented interfaces.

Method: Introduces VOIX framework with declarative HTML elements (<tool> and <context> tags) that allow websites to explicitly define available actions and relevant state for AI agents.

Result: Hackathon study with 16 developers showed participants could rapidly build diverse functional agent-enabled web applications regardless of prior experience.

Conclusion: VOIX provides a foundational mechanism for the Agentic Web, enabling seamless and secure human-AI collaboration by giving website developers control while preserving user privacy.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of autonomous AI agents on the web is hampered by a fundamental misalignment: agents must infer affordances from human-oriented user interfaces, leading to brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions. To address this, we introduce VOIX, a web-native framework that enables websites to expose reliable, auditable, and privacy-preserving capabilities for AI agents through simple, declarative HTML elements. VOIX introduces <tool> and <context> tags, allowing developers to explicitly define available actions and relevant state, thereby creating a clear, machine-readable contract for agent behavior. This approach shifts control to the website developer while preserving user privacy by disconnecting the conversational interactions from the website. We evaluated the framework's practicality, learnability, and expressiveness in a three-day hackathon study with 16 developers. The results demonstrate that participants, regardless of prior experience, were able to rapidly build diverse and functional agent-enabled web applications. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational mechanism for realizing the Agentic Web, enabling a future of seamless and secure human-AI collaboration on the web.

Abstract: Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics.

*Elyes Hajji,Aymen Bouguerra,Fabio Arnez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs, distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, and proposes attention-based methods that outperform sampling-based approaches for intrinsic hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in safety-critical applications but remain prone to hallucinations. Existing detection methods are computationally expensive and don't distinguish between different hallucination types, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposed a principled evaluation framework differentiating extrinsic vs intrinsic hallucinations, and introduced novel attention aggregation strategies using attention-based uncertainty quantification for improved detection performance.

Result: Sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy work well for extrinsic hallucinations but fail on intrinsic ones. The attention-based method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, performs better for intrinsic hallucinations.

Conclusion: Attention serves as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty, and detection strategies should be aligned with the specific nature of hallucination types. The findings provide new directions for improving hallucination detection in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

TL;DR: MeZO enables larger model fine-tuning on edge devices by eliminating activation/optimizer state storage needs, trading wall-clock time for memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge AI systems need on-device fine-tuning under strict memory constraints, but BP-based training requires storing activations and optimizer states that limit deployable model size.

Method: Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) estimates gradients using forward evaluations only, eliminating need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states.

Result: MeZO enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, with theoretical and numerical validation showing accuracy advantages under memory constraints when sufficient fine-tuning time is available.

Conclusion: MeZO provides a viable approach for on-device fine-tuning of larger models by trading wall-clock time for memory efficiency, enabling edge AI adaptation under stringent memory constraints.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoBA enables efficient long-context processing via sparse attention to key-value blocks, but lacks theoretical understanding and efficient GPU implementation. This paper develops a statistical model, identifies key improvements (smaller blocks, key convolution), and introduces FlashMoBA for practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand MoBA's design principles and enable practical adoption by addressing computational inefficiency and lack of theoretical foundation.

Method: Developed statistical model to analyze MoBA mechanics, derived signal-to-noise ratio for routing accuracy, identified improvements (smaller blocks, key convolution), and created FlashMoBA CUDA kernel for efficient GPU implementation.

Result: Improved MoBA models match dense attention baseline performance. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis guides practical improvements to MoBA, and FlashMoBA enables efficient implementation, making sparse attention viable for long-context processing.

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LT-Soups: A two-stage model soups framework that addresses the head-tail accuracy trade-off in long-tailed datasets by averaging balanced fine-tuned models and then fine-tuning only the classifier on full data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA preserve tail-class performance but sacrifice head-class accuracy, especially in balanced and head-heavy distributions. The head-tail ratio is identified as a crucial overlooked factor.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Average models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias, 2) Fine-tune only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy.

Result: LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across six benchmark datasets and various imbalance regimes.

Conclusion: LT-Soups effectively generalizes across diverse long-tailed regimes by addressing the head-tail ratio problem and providing better accuracy balance between head and tail classes.

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

TL;DR: Proposes a closed-form solution for controllable model merging that replaces costly offline optimization with a single-step linear transformation, enabling on-the-fly Pareto-optimal model generation with linear complexity scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in model merging from parameter interference and enable explicit balance of performance trade-offs through controllable merging, overcoming limitations of existing compile-then-query approaches with exponential complexity growth.

Method: Shifts from parameter-space optimization to direct correction of model's final representation, modeling correction as optimal linear transformation with closed-form solution that is architecture-agnostic and computed in single step.

Result: Generates superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient on-the-fly controllable model merging with linear complexity scaling, making it practical for applications requiring rapid preference-aware model generation.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Unsupervised Robust Domain Adaptation (URDA) to address both domain shift and adversarial attacks in UDA, proposing a Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART) method that achieves robustness without complex modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most UDA approaches focus on transfer ability but overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Vanilla adversarial training (VAT) fails in UDA, creating a need to understand why and develop effective robust UDA methods.

Method: Proposed URDA paradigm with DART algorithm - a two-step training procedure: 1) pre-train any UDA model, 2) apply instantaneous robustification via disentangled distillation to address inherent entanglement in UDA+VAT.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, validating the URDA paradigm and theory.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the first URDA paradigm and theory, successfully addressing both adversarial noise and domain shift through the simple yet effective DART method.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching models face practical deployment challenges due to high-precision parameter requirements, needing efficient compression for edge and embedded AI applications.

Method: Adapt optimal transport-based post-training quantization to minimize 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, with systematic comparison against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization.

Result: OT-based quantization preserves visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter across five benchmark datasets, where alternative methods fail.

Conclusion: OT-based quantization is a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for practical deployment.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

TL;DR: CLARITY is a framework that addresses accent and linguistic biases in TTS systems through contextual linguistic adaptation and retrieval-augmented accent prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS systems have persistent accent bias (defaulting to dominant phonetic patterns) and linguistic bias (ignoring dialect-specific lexical and cultural cues), which are interdependent issues.

Method: Dual-signal optimization: (i) contextual linguistic adaptation to localize input text to target dialect, and (ii) retrieval-augmented accent prompting (RAAP) to supply accent-consistent speech prompts.

Result: Across twelve English accents, CLARITY improves accent accuracy and fairness while maintaining strong perceptual quality.

Conclusion: CLARITY effectively addresses coupled biases in TTS systems through its backbone-agnostic framework, enhancing accent fidelity and linguistic authenticity.

Abstract: Instruction-guided text-to-speech (TTS) research has reached a maturity level where excellent speech generation quality is possible on demand, yet two coupled biases persist: accent bias, where models default to dominant phonetic patterns, and linguistic bias, where dialect-specific lexical and cultural cues are ignored. These biases are interdependent, as authentic accent generation requires both accent fidelity and localized text. We present Contextual Linguistic Adaptation and Retrieval for Inclusive TTS sYnthesis (CLARITY), a backbone-agnostic framework that addresses these biases through dual-signal optimization: (i) contextual linguistic adaptation that localizes input text to the target dialect, and (ii) retrieval-augmented accent prompting (RAAP) that supplies accent-consistent speech prompts. Across twelve English accents, CLARITY improves accent accuracy and fairness while maintaining strong perceptual quality.

TL;DR: Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA) improves visuomotor policy robustness by learning to focus on task-relevant visual cues while ignoring distractors, without requiring dataset augmentation or PVR fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained visual representations can encode task-irrelevant scene information, making visuomotor policies vulnerable to visual changes and distractors in perturbed scenes.

Method: A lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism called Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA) that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues and ignore scene distractors.

Result: Policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in both simulation and real-world experiments with visual perturbations.

Conclusion: Ignoring extraneous visual information is crucial for deploying robust and generalizable visuomotor policies.

Abstract: The adoption of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs), leveraging features from large-scale vision models, has become a popular paradigm for training visuomotor policies. However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies. Project Page: tsagkas.github.io/afa

TL;DR: LIBERO-Mem is a non-Markovian task suite for robotic manipulation that requires tracking objects over time. Embodied-SlotSSM is proposed as a scalable vision-language-action framework using slot-state-space modeling and relational encoding to handle temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents need to track and reason about individual object instances over time in complex environments, especially when key decision cues are hidden in object-specific histories rather than current scenes. Current visuomotor policies fail without persistent memory of prior interactions.

Method: Embodied-SlotSSM uses slot-centric vision-language-action framework with two key components: slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and a relational encoder to align input tokens with action decoding for temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on both LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, showing it provides a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.

Conclusion: The proposed Embodied-SlotSSM framework offers a scalable approach for handling non-Markovian reasoning in robotic manipulation tasks that require tracking objects over time, addressing the limitations of traditional vision-language-action models in temporal scalability.

Abstract: As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.

Method: Proposes TLV-CoRe with Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across sensors, tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant features, and Unified Bridging Adapter for enhanced tri-modal interaction in shared representation space.

Result: Experimental results show TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Also introduces RSS evaluation framework focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability.

Conclusion: TLV-CoRe offers a new direction for multimodal tactile representation by addressing sensor standardization issues and improving tri-modal integration.

Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.

### [202] [PISanitizer: Preventing Prompt Injection to Long-Context LLMs via Prompt Sanitization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10720)
*Runpeng Geng,Yanting Wang,Chenlong Yin,Minhao Cheng,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PISanitizer is a defense against prompt injection attacks in long-context LLMs that identifies and removes injected tokens by leveraging LLMs' attention mechanisms to detect instruction-following behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where malicious instructions are hidden in long contexts, and existing defenses designed for short contexts are ineffective in long-context scenarios.

Method: PISanitizer first makes an LLM intentionally follow arbitrary instructions in a context, then sanitizes tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior, leveraging the observation that injected instructions compel LLMs to focus on specific tokens.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows PISanitizer successfully prevents prompt injection, maintains utility, outperforms existing defenses, is efficient, and robust against optimization-based and adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: PISanitizer presents an effective defense that creates a dilemma for attackers - the more effective an injected instruction is, the more likely it is to be detected and sanitized.

Abstract: Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DualVision ArthroNav is a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera with the arthroscope to resolve scale ambiguity and drift issues in monocular SLAM, achieving accurate surgical navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optical tracking systems impose workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow, while vision-based alternatives suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to motion/occlusion.

Method: Integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope to provide stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while using the monocular arthroscope video for dense scene reconstruction.

Result: Achieves average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm, target registration error of 2.16 mm, and high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19).

Conclusion: Provides a practical, cost-efficient solution bridging optical tracking and vision-based systems, paving the way for clinically deployable arthroscopic guidance.

Abstract: Arthroscopic procedures can greatly benefit from navigation systems that enhance spatial awareness, depth perception, and field of view. However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance.

*Syed Mumtahin Mahmud,Mahdi Mohd Hossain Noki,Prothito Shovon Majumder,Abdul Mohaimen Al Radi,Md. Haider Ali,Md. Mosaddek Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A dual-domain architecture combining Vision Transformers with FFT-ReLU module for image deblurring, achieving superior performance through spatial attention and frequency sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches (CNNs and ViTs) struggle with complex/high-resolution blur and computational demands, needing better integration of spatial and frequency domain information.

Method: Proposed dual-domain architecture that unifies Vision Transformers with FFT-ReLU module, using ViT for spatial attention and FFT-ReLU for frequency-domain sparsity to suppress blur artifacts.

Result: Achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art models, confirmed by quantitative metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human preference evaluations.

Conclusion: Establishes a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration by effectively bridging spatial and frequency domains.

Abstract: Image deblurring is vital in computer vision, aiming to recover sharp images from blurry ones caused by motion or camera shake. While deep learning approaches such as CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced this field, they often struggle with complex or high-resolution blur and computational demands. We propose a new dual-domain architecture that unifies Vision Transformers with a frequency-domain FFT-ReLU module, explicitly bridging spatial attention modeling and frequency sparsity. In this structure, the ViT backbone captures local and global dependencies, while the FFT-ReLU component enforces frequency-domain sparsity to suppress blur-related artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this architecture achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Both quantitative metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human preference evaluations confirm its effectiveness, establishing a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration.

*Lihua Jian,Jiabo Liu,Shaowu Wu,Lihui Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CLIPPan is an unsupervised pansharpening framework that uses CLIP as a supervisor to enable full-resolution training without ground truth, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain adaptation challenges in supervised pansharpening methods caused by the disparity between simulated training data and real-world full-resolution scenarios.

Method: Fine-tunes CLIP to recognize pansharpening components, then uses semantic language constraints with textual prompts to align image fusion transitions and guide learning without ground truth.

Result: Consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Sets a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening by using language as supervisory signal.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in supervised pansharpening neural networks, these methods face domain adaptation challenges of resolution due to the intrinsic disparity between simulated reduced-resolution training data and real-world full-resolution scenarios.To bridge this gap, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening framework, CLIPPan, that enables model training at full resolution directly by taking CLIP, a visual-language model, as a supervisor. However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening.

*Ziyi Li,Qingyu Mao,Shuai Liu,Qilei Li,Fanyang Meng,Yongsheng Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Online-RepNeRV is a neural video representation framework using online structural reparameterization to enhance model capacity while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NVR methods have complex designs with high computational overhead and limited model capacity, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes ERB (universal reparameterization block) with multiple parallel convolutional paths, using online reparameterization to fuse parameters during training and convert to single-branch structure after training.

Result: Achieves 0.37-2.7 dB PSNR gain over baselines while maintaining comparable training time and decoding speed.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances model capacity and performance without compromising decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Neural Video Representation~(NVR) is a promising paradigm for video compression, showing great potential in improving video storage and transmission efficiency. While recent advances have made efforts in architectural refinements to improve representational capability, these methods typically involve complex designs, which may incur increased computational overhead and lack the flexibility to integrate into other frameworks. Moreover, the inherent limitation in model capacity restricts the expressiveness of NVR networks, resulting in a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, we propose Online-RepNeRV, a NVR framework based on online structural reparameterization. Specifically, we propose a universal reparameterization block named ERB, which incorporates multiple parallel convolutional paths to enhance the model capacity. To mitigate the overhead, an online reparameterization strategy is adopted to dynamically fuse the parameters during training, and the multi-branch structure is equivalently converted into a single-branch structure after training. As a result, the additional computational and parameter complexity is confined to the encoding stage, without affecting the decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments on mainstream video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an average PSNR gain of 0.37-2.7 dB over baseline methods, while maintaining comparable training time and decoding speed.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modality-invariant representation learning approach for brain MRI data, evaluating its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation after large-scale self-supervised pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt self-supervised learning frameworks from natural images to capture multi-modal MRI information, addressing the gap in current SSL approaches that are primarily tailored for natural images rather than medical imaging.

Method: The method involves a modality-invariant representation learning setup with large-scale pre-training on unlabeled brain MRI data using self-supervised learning, followed by evaluation on lesion segmentation tasks.

Result: Experimental results show that while cross-modality alignment is successful, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features rather than modality-invariant representations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that modality-specific features are crucial for lesion segmentation tasks in neuroimaging, despite successful cross-modality alignment in the proposed representation learning framework.

Abstract: The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MoCo-INR is an unsupervised method combining implicit neural representations with motion-compensated framework for high-quality cardiac MRI reconstruction from highly undersampled data, achieving 20x acceleration with superior image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CMR reconstruction methods either produce unsatisfactory image quality or are limited by ground truth data scarcity, restricting clinical applicability.

Method: Integrates implicit neural representations (INR) with motion-compensated framework using explicit motion modeling and continuous INR priors, with a specialized INR network architecture for CMR.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with fast convergence and fine-detailed reconstructions at 20x acceleration, validated on both retrospective and prospective free-breathing CMR scans.

Conclusion: MoCo-INR provides accurate cardiac motion decomposition and high-quality reconstruction, demonstrating clinical practicality for real-time CMR imaging.

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is widely used to characterize cardiac morphology and function. To accelerate CMR imaging, various methods have been proposed to recover high-quality spatiotemporal CMR images from highly undersampled k-t space data. However, current CMR reconstruction techniques either fail to achieve satisfactory image quality or are restricted by the scarcity of ground truth data, leading to limited applicability in clinical scenarios. In this work, we proposed MoCo-INR, a new unsupervised method that integrates implicit neural representations (INR) with the conventional motion-compensated (MoCo) framework. Using explicit motion modeling and the continuous prior of INRs, MoCo-INR can produce accurate cardiac motion decomposition and high-quality CMR reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a new INR network architecture tailored to the CMR problem, which significantly stabilizes model optimization. Experiments on retrospective (simulated) datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoCo-INR over state-of-the-art methods, achieving fast convergence and fine-detailed reconstructions at ultra-high acceleration factors (e.g., 20x in VISTA sampling). Additionally, evaluations on prospective (real-acquired) free-breathing CMR scans highlight the clinical practicality of MoCo-INR for real-time imaging. Several ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the critical components of MoCo-INR.

Motivation: To develop effective multimodal representation learning practices for e-commerce applications and bridge the misalignment between multimodal learning objectives and downstream tasks.

Method: Three-stage training paradigm (Pretraining, Post-training, Application), defining exchange rate to quantify metric translation, focusing on image-based search recall as key intermediate metric, iterative improvements across data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application.

Result: Achieved +20.00% online CTR improvement - the largest improvement on CTR prediction task over three years, fully deployed across Taobao's search advertising system including retrieval, relevance, and ranking.

Conclusion: MOON provides valuable insights for multimodal representation learning in e-commerce, with systematic scaling studies revealing scaling laws for training tokens, negative samples, and user behavior sequences.

Abstract: We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.

*Zhonghua Jiang,Kui Chen,Kunxi Li,Keting Yin,Yiyun Zhou,Zhaode Wang,Chengfei Lv,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: AccKV is an adaptive KV cache optimization framework for Audio-Video LLMs that uses layer-adaptive focusing and cross-calibration to selectively retain important modality tokens while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV-LLMs face efficiency challenges due to large KV caches from temporal audio and spatio-temporal video data. Naive modality selection fails because attention patterns in higher layers shift toward video regardless of task, and indiscriminate processing causes information confusion and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes AccKV with two techniques: 1) Layer Adaptive Focusing - selectively focuses on key modalities per layer characteristics and redistributes attention to heavy hitter tokens; 2) Cross-Calibration - integrates inefficient KV caches within modalities, then aligns low-priority with high-priority modalities to selectively evict low-priority KV caches.

Result: Experimental results show AccKV significantly improves computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: AccKV effectively addresses KV cache optimization challenges in AV-LLMs through adaptive modality focusing and cross-calibration, achieving efficient inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) have enhanced their capabilities in tasks like audio-visual question answering and multimodal dialog systems. Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning in pathology doesn't always improve performance - combining weak modalities can degrade accuracy, requiring selective integration based on individual modality performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that combining multiple data modalities inherently improves predictive performance in computational pathology, and test whether multimodal gains depend on the quality of individual modalities.

Method: Used a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence, comparing multimodal vs unimodal model performance.

Result: Combining high-performing modalities yields superior performance, but integrating poor-performing modalities with better ones actually degrades predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design in computational pathology and medical imaging.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI automation methods suffer from insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies and over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization.

Method: Co-EPG establishes iterative positive feedback loops where planning models explore strategies under grounding-based rewards via GRPO, generating diverse data to optimize grounding models, which in turn provide better rewards for planning model training.

Result: On Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, Co-EPG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data, with consistent improvement in each iteration.

Conclusion: This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

TL;DR: This survey reframes LLM reasoning through adaptivity - the ability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics like difficulty and uncertainty, addressing the limitation of uniform reasoning strategies in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This overlooks the fundamental challenge of adaptive reasoning allocation.

Method: The paper formalizes deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning in LLM context, frames adaptive reasoning as control-augmented policy optimization, and proposes a taxonomy organizing methods into training-based (RL, supervised fine-tuning, learned controllers) and training-free approaches (prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, modular composition).

Result: The framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies, connecting classical cognitive paradigms with algorithmic realizations.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control, providing a comprehensive foundation for future research on adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

TL;DR: MUG introduces a multi-agent undercover gaming protocol that detects hallucinating agents in LLMs using counterfactual image modifications and multimodal reasoning, improving reliability over traditional debate approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucinations in LLM reasoning by overcoming limitations of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) which assumes all agents are rational, when in reality agents themselves can hallucinate.

Method: Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol inspired by social deduction games, using counterfactual image modifications to identify hallucinating agents through multimodal reasoning and active probing discussions.

Result: MUG enables factual verification beyond statistical consensus, introduces cross-evidence reasoning with dynamic evidence sources, and fosters active reasoning among agents.

Conclusion: MUG provides a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs by detecting hallucinating agents through counterfactual testing and active discussion protocols.

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

Result: Effective mitigation of unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes, outperforming prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents.

Conclusion: Test-time policy shaping provides scalable solution for ethical alignment without agent retraining, enabling principled trade-off between alignment and reward maximization.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blood coagulation after drawing poses challenges for hematological analysis, potentially leading to inaccurate test results and altered cellular characteristics that compromise diagnostic reliability.

Method: Digital Holographic Microscopy with automated image processing and deep learning pipeline for morphological analysis of blood cells under two anticoagulants (EDTA and KFeOx-NPs), enabling automated high-throughput screening and coagulation rate estimation.

Result: KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering RBC morphology, while EDTA caused notable changes within 6 hours. System enables quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics through cell clustering and morphology assessment.

Conclusion: The framework offers insights into comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants ex vivo, providing a non-invasive approach for accurate cell counting and morphological estimation in blood analysis.

Abstract: The coagulation of blood after it is drawn from the body poses a significant challenge for hematological analysis, potentially leading to inaccurate test results and altered cellular characteristics, compromising diagnostic reliability. This paper presents a deep learning-enhanced framework for delineating anticoagulant efficacy ex vivo using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). We demonstrate a label-free, non-invasive approach for analyzing human blood samples, capable of accurate cell counting and morphological estimation. A DHM with an automated image processing and deep learning pipeline is built for morphological analysis of the blood cells under two different anti-coagulation agents, e.g. conventional EDTA and novel potassium ferric oxalate nanoparticles (KFeOx-NPs). This enables automated high-throughput screening of cells and estimation of blood coagulation rates when samples are treated with different anticoagulants. Results indicated that KFeOx-NPs prevented human blood coagulation without altering the cellular morphology of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas EDTA incubation caused notable changes within 6 hours of incubation. The system allows for quantitative analysis of coagulation dynamics by assessing parameters like cell clustering and morphology over time in these prepared samples, offering insights into the comparative efficacy and effects of anticoagulants outside the body.

TL;DR: A theoretical framework that unifies game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system-level evaluation into agent-level credit and message-level learning signals for LLM multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM multi-agent training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning, creating a gap between global performance assessment and local training signals.

Method: Combines cooperative game-theoretic attribution (Shapley values) with process reward modeling to produce local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. Uses Shapley-based credit assignment for success cases and first-error localization for failure cases.

Result: Produces bounded, cooperative training signals that are directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training. The signals promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage in success cases, and penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts in failure cases.

Conclusion: Provides a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training, establishing a theoretical foundation for connecting system-level outcomes with agent-level learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.
