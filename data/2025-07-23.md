### [1] [eSapiens's DEREK Module: Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15863)
*Isaac Shi,Zeyuan Li,Fan Liu,Wenli Wang,Lewei He,Yang Yang,Tianyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEREK is a secure enterprise document QA system that combines retrieval-augmented generation with citation verification to provide accurate, traceable answers from heterogeneous documents while meeting enterprise security requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise domains like legal and finance require document QA systems that are not only accurate but also secure, auditable, and provide traceable citations for every claim made in responses, which existing solutions fail to adequately address.

Method: The system uses a multi-stage pipeline: (1) ingests heterogeneous content and splits into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, (2) indexes using hybrid HNSW+BM25 search, (3) refines queries with GPT-4o, (4) retrieves and reranks results with Cohere, (5) generates answers using CO-STAR prompt engineering, and (6) employs a LangGraph verifier to ensure citation overlap and regenerate answers until all claims are grounded.

Result: On LegalBench subsets, 1000-token chunks improved Recall@50 by ~1pp, hybrid+rerank boosted Precision@10 by ~7pp, and the verifier achieved TRACe Utilization above 0.50 while limiting unsupported statements to less than 3%. The system runs securely with end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256 encryption.

Conclusion: DEREK successfully delivers accurate, traceable, and production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead, meeting enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful retrieval suitable for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge)
Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed
specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and
implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,
web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a
hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via
combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using
CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,
regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,
1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank
boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe
Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All
components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These
results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and
production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is
designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful
retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal
and finance.

### [2] [Adversarial Demonstration Learning for Low-resource NER Using Dual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15864)
*Guowen Yuan,Tien-Hsuan Wu,Lianghao Xia,Ben Kao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper improves named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource scenarios by enhancing demonstration learning through dual similarity-based example selection and adversarial training to force better demonstration utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demonstration learning methods for low-resource NER suffer from two key issues: (1) demonstration selection relies only on semantic similarity, missing important feature similarity, and (2) NER models inadequately reference demonstration examples during tagging.

Method: The authors propose a dual approach: (1) selecting demonstration examples using both semantic similarity and feature similarity (dual similarity), and (2) training NER models with adversarial demonstration to force the model to actively refer to demonstrations during the tagging task.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on low-resource NER tasks show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating significant performance improvements through better demonstration selection and utilization.

Conclusion: The dual similarity approach for demonstration selection combined with adversarial training effectively addresses the limitations of existing demonstration learning methods, leading to superior performance in low-resource NER scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) based on demonstration
learning in low-resource scenarios. We identify two issues in demonstration
construction and model training. Firstly, existing methods for selecting
demonstration examples primarily rely on semantic similarity; We show that
feature similarity can provide significant performance improvement. Secondly,
we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is
generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that
effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select
examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and
feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with
adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the
demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive
experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our
method outperforms a range of methods.

### [3] [Small Edits, Big Consequences: Telling Good from Bad Robustness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15868)
*Altynbek Ismailov,Salia Asanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how large language models respond to different types of prompt modifications when solving coding problems, revealing that LLMs are overly robust to underspecification but insufficiently sensitive to critical semantic changes like quantifier flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are deployed in high-stakes coding environments where misreading critical details can have serious consequences, yet they may be ignoring important changes while being overly tolerant of irrelevant noise. The authors aim to understand where useful robustness ends and harmful insensitivity begins.

Method: The researchers compiled 50 LeetCode problems and applied three types of minimal prompt perturbations: (1) progressive underspecification by deleting 10% of words per step, (2) lexical flips swapping critical quantifiers like "max" to "min", and (3) jargon inflation replacing common nouns with obscure technical synonyms. Six frontier models including reasoning-tuned versions were tested, generating 11,853 total responses that were evaluated against original test suites.

Result: The study revealed a sharp double asymmetry: models maintained 85% correctness even with 90% of the prompt missing (over-robustness to underspecification), but only 54% adapted to critical quantifier flips that reversed the task meaning, with reasoning-tuned models being even less sensitive than base models. Jargon edits had intermediate effects at 56% adaptation rate.

Conclusion: Current LLMs inappropriately blur the distinction between harmless noise and semantically meaningful changes, often treating both as ignorable. The authors advocate for evaluation and training protocols that reward differential sensitivity - maintaining stability under benign noise while adapting or refusing when semantics truly change. Masking salient anchors like function names can help force proper re-evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a
single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to
overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful
insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal
prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive
underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping
a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a
common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including
three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python
outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they
reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a
sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 %
of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet
only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with
reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie
in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between
harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable.
Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We
advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential
sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when
semantics truly change.

### [4] [Enhancing Hindi NER in Low Context: A Comparative study of Transformer-based models with vs. without Retrieval Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16002)
*Sumit Singh,Rohit Mishra,Uma Shanker Tiwary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates Hindi Named Entity Recognition (NER) using pretrained encoders (MuRIL, XLM-R) and generative models (Llama variants, GPT-3.5) with retrieval augmentation from Wikipedia, showing that retrieval augmentation significantly improves NER performance across most models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entity recognition (NER) is a major challenge in natural language processing, particularly for resource-limited languages like Hindi. The study aims to improve Hindi NER performance by leveraging pretrained language models and exploring whether external knowledge retrieval can enhance entity recognition capabilities.

Method: The researchers used Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and generative models (Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, Llama-3-70B, and GPT-3.5-turbo) with retrieval augmentation (RA) using Wikipedia data. They fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R, and Llama2-7B with and without RA, while using larger models (Llama2-70B, Llama3-70B, GPT-3.5) for few-shot NER generation.

Result: Models with retrieval augmentation outperformed baseline methods without RA in most cases. MuRIL's macro F1 score improved from 0.69 to 0.70, and XLM-R improved from 0.495 to 0.71 with RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B significantly outperformed the base model. GPT-3.5-turbo adopted RA well, but Llama2-70B and Llama3-70B did not effectively utilize the retrieval context.

Conclusion: Retrieval augmentation significantly improves NER performance, especially for low-context data. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining pretrained models with data augmentation methods for enhancing NER performance in resource-limited languages like Hindi, contributing valuable insights for NER optimization strategies.

Abstract: One major challenge in natural language processing is named entity
recognition (NER), which identifies and categorises named entities in textual
input. In order to improve NER, this study investigates a Hindi NER technique
that makes use of Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and
Generative Models ( Llama-2-7B-chat-hf (Llama2-7B), Llama-2-70B-chat-hf
(Llama2-70B), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Llama3-70B) and GPT3.5-turbo), and augments
the data with retrieved data from external relevant contexts, notably from
Wikipedia. We have fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R and Llama2-7B with and without RA.
However, Llama2-70B, lama3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo are utilised for few-shot NER
generation. Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs)
with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't
incorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69
and 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71,
respectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B
by a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not
fine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA
well; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval
context. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance,
especially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about
how best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER
performance, particularly in languages with limited resources.

### [5] [Learning without training: The implicit dynamics of in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16003)
*Benoit Dherin,Michael Munn,Hanna Mazzawi,Michael Wunder,Javier Gonzalvo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Language Models achieve in-context learning by showing that transformer blocks can implicitly modify MLP weights based on context, providing a theoretical explanation for LLMs' ability to learn new patterns at inference time without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanisms behind in-context learning in Large Language Models are largely unknown despite being one of their most striking capabilities. LLMs can learn new patterns from examples in prompts at inference time without weight updates, even for patterns not seen during training, but the underlying process remains mysterious.

Method: The authors analyze the interaction between self-attention layers and MLPs in transformer blocks, using both theoretical analysis and experimentation. They work under mild simplifying assumptions to demonstrate how transformer blocks can implicitly transform context into low-rank weight updates of the MLP layer.

Result: The study demonstrates that the stacking of self-attention with MLP layers enables transformer blocks to implicitly modify MLP weights according to context. They show how a transformer block can transform context into low-rank weight-updates of the MLP layer, providing a mechanistic explanation for in-context learning.

Conclusion: The simple mechanism of self-attention and MLP interaction may explain why LLMs can learn in context during inference rather than only during training. This implicit weight modification based on context provides a theoretical foundation for understanding in-context learning capabilities in transformer-based models.

Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLM) is their
ability to learn in context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn
new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are
presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were
not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are
still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a
self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly
modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through
theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why
LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show
under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly
transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

### [6] [Help Me Write a Story: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Generate Writing Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16007)
*Hannah Rashkin,Elizabeth Clark,Fantine Huot,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether LLMs can provide meaningful writing feedback to creative writers by creating a controlled test set of 1,300 corrupted stories and evaluating model performance using both automatic and human metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether LLMs can effectively support creative writers by providing valuable writing feedback, addressing the challenges and limitations of automated writing assistance in creative contexts.

Method: The researchers created a novel test set of 1,300 stories that were intentionally corrupted to introduce specific writing issues, then evaluated commonly used LLMs' feedback performance using both automatic and human evaluation metrics in a controlled experimental setting.

Result: Current LLMs demonstrate strong out-of-the-box performance in providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, they struggle with identifying the most significant writing issues in stories and making appropriate decisions about when to provide critical versus positive feedback.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for writing feedback with good specificity and general accuracy, they have notable limitations in prioritizing major writing issues and calibrating the tone of their feedback appropriately, indicating areas for improvement in AI-assisted creative writing tools.

Abstract: Can LLMs provide support to creative writers by giving meaningful writing
feedback? In this paper, we explore the challenges and limitations of
model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and
evaluation frameworks. To study model performance in a controlled manner, we
present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally
introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in
this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our analysis shows
that current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects --
providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often
fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide
when to offer critical vs. positive feedback.

### [7] [mRAKL: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Graph Construction for Low-Resourced Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16011)
*Hellina Hailu Nigatu,Min Li,Maartje ter Hoeve,Saloni Potdar,Sarah Chasins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces mRAKL, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that reformulates multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction as a Question Answering task, showing improved performance for low-resource languages like Tigrinya and Amharic through cross-lingual transfer from higher-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links in knowledge graphs for multilingual settings, particularly focusing on low-resource languages that lack sufficient training data for traditional knowledge graph construction methods.

Method: The authors reformulate multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) as a Question Answering task using mRAKL, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system. The method uses head entities and linking relations as questions, with the model predicting tail entities as answers. They employ BM25 retriever and leverage cross-lingual transfer from higher-resource languages (Arabic and English) to support low-resource languages.

Result: The RAG-based approach shows improved performance over no-context settings when using BM25 retriever. With an idealized retrieval system, mRAKL achieves accuracy improvements of 4.92 percentage points for Tigrinya and 8.79 percentage points for Amharic compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that reformulating multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction as a QA task with RAG-based systems can effectively improve performance for low-resource languages. The approach successfully leverages cross-lingual transfer and retrieval mechanisms to enhance knowledge graph construction capabilities in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs represent real-world entities and the relationships between
them. Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) refers to the task of
automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for
knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting. In this work, we reformulate the
mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. We achieve
this by using the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having
our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Our experiments focus primarily
on two low-resourced languages: Tigrinya and Amharic. We experiment with using
higher-resourced languages Arabic and English for cross-lingual transfer. With
a BM25 retriever, we find that the RAG-based approach improves performance over
a no-context setting. Further, our ablation studies show that with an idealized
retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by 4.92 and 8.79 percentage points
for Tigrinya and Amharic, respectively.

### [8] [AutoMeet: a proof-of-concept study of genAI to automate meetings in automotive engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16054)
*Simon Baeuerle,Max Radyschevski,Ulrike Pado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed and tested a genAI-powered system that automatically transcribes meetings and creates searchable documentation through a chatbot interface, finding that while technically feasible, organizational and ethical considerations are crucial for successful implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large organizations struggle with inefficient knowledge sharing through frequent meetings that produce inconsistent documentation (minutes, notes, presentations), making shared information difficult to retrieve and necessitating lengthy updates and high-frequency meeting schedules.

Method: Implemented an end-to-end pipeline using generative AI (LLMs) that automatically records meetings, creates minutes, and integrates heterogeneous information sources into a searchable format via a chatbot interface. Tested this proof-of-concept system in a real-world engineering department and collected extensive survey data on ethical and technical aspects.

Result: Users agreed that genAI could significantly reduce meeting effort, technical aspects were largely solved, but organizational aspects emerged as crucial factors. The real-world testing revealed both opportunities for efficiency gains and risks that need to be managed.

Conclusion: While genAI-based meeting documentation systems are technically viable and can reduce meeting overhead, successful ethical usage requires careful attention to organizational aspects and proper implementation strategies in real-world engineering environments.

Abstract: In large organisations, knowledge is mainly shared in meetings, which takes
up significant amounts of work time. Additionally, frequent in-person meetings
produce inconsistent documentation -- official minutes, personal notes,
presentations may or may not exist. Shared information therefore becomes hard
to retrieve outside of the meeting, necessitating lengthy updates and
high-frequency meeting schedules.
  Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) models like Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit an impressive performance on spoken and written language
processing. This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management
in engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and
integrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable
format for ad-hoc searches.
  We implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting
documentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and
minutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through
a chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software
tooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey
data on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this
real-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that
the effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI
models, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational
aspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system.

*Rujun Han,Yanfei Chen,Zoey CuiZhu,Lesly Miculicich,Guan Sun,Yuanjun Bi,Weiming Wen,Hui Wan,Chunfeng Wen,Solène Maître,George Lee,Vishy Tirumalashetty,Emily Xue,Zizhao Zhang,Salem Haykal,Burak Gokturk,Tomas Pfister,Chen-Yu Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTD-DR, a novel framework that treats research report generation as a diffusion process, starting with a preliminary draft and iteratively refining it through denoising informed by retrieval mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on research benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep research agents powered by LLMs often plateau in performance when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. There's a need for a more effective approach that mimics human research processes involving cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision.

Method: The Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR) framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. It starts with a preliminary draft as an updatable skeleton, then iteratively refines it through a "denoising" process dynamically informed by retrieval mechanisms. The approach includes a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow to enhance context quality.

Result: TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks requiring intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents. The draft-centric design improves timeliness and coherence while reducing information loss during iterative search processes.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based approach to research report generation, with its draft-centric iterative refinement process, represents a significant advancement over existing methods, demonstrating superior performance on complex research tasks that require extensive information retrieval and reasoning.

Abstract: Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly
advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex,
long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing
inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles
of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep
Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report
generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a
preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation
to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through
a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism
that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is
further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of
the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the
diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process
more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative
search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art
results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and
multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.

### [10] [The Prompt Makes the Person(a): A Systematic Evaluation of Sociodemographic Persona Prompting for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16076)
*Marlene Lutz,Indira Sen,Georg Ahnert,Elisa Rogers,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how different persona prompting strategies affect LLMs' ability to simulate diverse sociodemographic groups, finding that prompt formulation significantly impacts simulation fidelity, with smaller models sometimes outperforming larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used for persona prompting to simulate different sociodemographic groups, but concerns exist about the fidelity of such simulations due to varying prompt formulation effects on outcomes.

Method: Systematic examination using five open-source LLMs across 15 intersectional demographic groups, testing different persona prompt strategies including role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies in both open- and closed-ended tasks.

Result: LLMs struggle with marginalized groups (nonbinary, Hispanic, Middle Eastern identities); interview-style prompting and name-based priming reduce stereotyping and improve alignment; smaller models like OLMo-2-7B outperform larger ones like Llama-3.3-70B; prompt strategy choice significantly impacts demographic group portrayal.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation studies, demonstrating that careful prompt engineering can improve simulation fidelity across diverse demographic groups.

Abstract: Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to
simulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona
prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about
the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we
systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically
role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM
simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and
closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate
marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern
identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption
strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that
prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce
stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B
outperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable
guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation
studies.

### [11] [Efficient Compositional Multi-tasking for On-device Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16083)
*Ondrej Bohdal,Mete Ozay,Jijoong Moon,Kyeng-Hun Lee,Hyeonmok Ko,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses compositional multi-tasking in LLMs for on-device settings, where single test examples require simultaneous execution of multiple tasks (like translation + summarization), proposing a benchmark and efficient Learnable Calibration method for resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on task merging in LLMs has been limited to single-task scenarios per test example. There's a need to address compositional multi-tasking where each test example requires simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, especially in resource-constrained on-device settings where computational efficiency is crucial.

Method: The authors propose Learnable Calibration, an efficient method specifically designed for on-device applications. They also introduce a benchmark comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks to facilitate research in this area. The method focuses on adapter parameter merging to support multiple simultaneous tasks.

Result: The paper presents a benchmark with four compositional tasks that can evaluate multi-tasking scenarios (such as generating translated summaries). The Learnable Calibration method is shown to be both resource-efficient and high-performing for on-device applications with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: The work establishes groundwork for advancing LLM capabilities in real-world multi-tasking scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use cases. The proposed benchmark and efficient method enable better handling of compositional tasks in on-device settings.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine
learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large
language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to
support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work
on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been
limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In
this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based
compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous
execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a
long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks
concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark
comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an
efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications,
where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions
that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the
groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking
scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use
cases.

### [12] [BIDWESH: A Bangla Regional Based Hate Speech Detection Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16183)
*Azizul Hakim Fayaz,MD. Shorif Uddin,Rayhan Uddin Bhuiyan,Zakia Sultana,Md. Samiul Islam,Bidyarthi Paul,Tashreef Muhammad,Shahriar Manzoor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIDWESH, the first multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset covering three major regional dialects (Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong) with 9,183 annotated instances, addressing the gap in hate speech detection for dialectal variations in Bangladesh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hate speech detection systems for Bangla only work with standard language and fail to address informal, culturally rich expressions found in regional dialects, resulting in limited detection capability and biased moderation that leaves harmful dialectal content undetected in linguistically diverse Bangladesh.

Method: The researchers constructed BIDWESH by translating and annotating 9,183 instances from the existing BD-SHS corpus into three major regional dialects (Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong), with manual verification and labeling for hate presence, type (slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual, male, female, group).

Result: The study successfully created a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive multi-dialectal hate speech dataset that ensures linguistic and contextual accuracy across three major Bangla dialects, providing the first comprehensive resource for dialectal hate speech detection in Bangladesh.

Conclusion: BIDWESH establishes the foundation for developing dialect-sensitive NLP tools and significantly contributes to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource language settings, advancing hate speech detection capabilities for dialectal Bangla content.

Abstract: Hate speech on digital platforms has become a growing concern globally,
especially in linguistically diverse countries like Bangladesh, where regional
dialects play a major role in everyday communication. Despite progress in hate
speech detection for standard Bangla, Existing datasets and systems fail to
address the informal and culturally rich expressions found in dialects such as
Barishal, Noakhali, and Chittagong. This oversight results in limited detection
capability and biased moderation, leaving large sections of harmful content
unaccounted for. To address this gap, this study introduces BIDWESH, the first
multi-dialectal Bangla hate speech dataset, constructed by translating and
annotating 9,183 instances from the BD-SHS corpus into three major regional
dialects. Each entry was manually verified and labeled for hate presence, type
(slander, gender, religion, call to violence), and target group (individual,
male, female, group), ensuring linguistic and contextual accuracy. The
resulting dataset provides a linguistically rich, balanced, and inclusive
resource for advancing hate speech detection in Bangla. BIDWESH lays the
groundwork for the development of dialect-sensitive NLP tools and contributes
significantly to equitable and context-aware content moderation in low-resource
language settings.

### [13] [Do Large Language Models Have a Planning Theory of Mind? Evidence from MindGames: a Multi-Step Persuasion Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16196)
*Jared Moore,Ned Cooper,Rasmus Overmark,Beba Cibralic,Nick Haber,Cameron R. Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MindGames, a novel "planning theory of mind" (PToM) task that evaluates how well agents can infer others' beliefs and desires to persuade behavioral change. Humans significantly outperformed the o1-preview LLM at this task, suggesting a gap between human social reasoning and current LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Theory of Mind (ToM) experiments only tested spectatorial abilities (predicting/interpreting behavior), but human ToM also involves dynamic action planning and strategic intervention on others' mental states. There was a need to evaluate practical use cases of ToM that go beyond passive observation.

Method: The researchers developed MindGames, a "planning theory of mind" task that requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires in order to persuade them to change their behavior. They compared human performance against o1-preview LLM on this task, as well as on a baseline condition requiring similar planning but minimal mental state inference.

Result: Humans significantly outperformed o1-preview on the PToM task by 11% (p=0.006). However, o1-preview outperformed humans in the baseline planning condition when participants were already given someone's preferences, suggesting LLMs are better at planning when mental state inference is not required.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities. Humans have implicit causal models of other agents that help them understand the need to ask about preferences, while LLMs lack this intuitive understanding of social dynamics despite having strong planning capabilities when given explicit information.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind
(ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial
role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human
ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically
intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning
theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's
beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous
evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans
significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher;
$p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model
of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's
preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline
condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state
inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already
given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between
human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities.

*Zipeng Ling,Yuehao Tang,Shuliang Liu,Junqi Yang,Shenghong Fu,Yao Wan,Kejia Huang,Zhichao Hou,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze why Large Language Models output "Unknown" responses, distinguishing between genuine indeterminacy and model incapacity, and proposes methods to improve LLM reasoning through guided stimulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs focus only on whether "Unknown" answers are honest, but fail to distinguish between genuinely indeterminate inputs and solvable problems that models fail to resolve. This creates a phenomenon called "Vague Perception" that obscures the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The authors develop a framework that quantifies the proportion of "Unknown" responses due to model incapacity versus genuine indeterminacy. They test whether guided stimulation can convert "Unknown" responses into either correct ("Known") or intrinsically indeterminate outcomes, and apply different methods to test if models can reach theoretical accuracy baselines.

Result: The framework successfully separates different sources of uncertainty in LLM responses and provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits. The method demonstrates the potential for improvement in LLM performance through targeted interventions.

Conclusion: The work provides a new perspective on understanding LLM reasoning abilities by addressing the "Vague Perception" phenomenon. By distinguishing between model limitations and genuine problem indeterminacy, the framework offers insights into the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their potential for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label \emph{Unknown}, yet
current evaluations focus almost exclusively on whether such answers are
\emph{honest} rather than why they arise. This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an
input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the
model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon \emph{Vague Perception}. And
thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of \emph{Unknown}
responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation
can convert them into either correct (\emph{Known}) or intrinsically
indeterminate outcomes. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method
provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for
improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different
LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the
accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the
true reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the
\emph{Vague Perception} phenomenon.

### [15] [Towards Compute-Optimal Many-Shot In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16217)
*Shahriar Golchin,Yanfei Chen,Rujun Han,Manan Gandhi,Tianli Yu,Swaroop Mishra,Mihai Surdeanu,Rishabh Agarwal,Chen-Yu Lee,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes two demonstration selection strategies for many-shot in-context learning that improve performance while maintaining computational efficiency through caching and reduced inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many-shot ICL typically uses random demonstration selection due to high inference costs and caching benefits, but this may not be optimal. The authors aim to develop better demonstration selection strategies that maintain computational efficiency while improving performance.

Method: Two strategies are proposed: (1) combining a small number of similarity-based demonstrations with a larger set of cached random demonstrations, and (2) replacing random demonstrations with those selected using k-means clustering centroids derived from test sample representations.

Result: Experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across multiple datasets show that both strategies consistently outperform random selection and match or exceed the most performant selection approaches while reducing inference costs by up to an order of magnitude through caching support.

Conclusion: The proposed demonstration selection strategies successfully balance performance and computational efficiency in many-shot ICL, offering practical solutions that improve upon random selection while maintaining the benefits of caching and cost reduction.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs
containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning
(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the
input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of
demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)
high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and
(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when
scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for
demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal
computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of
demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a
disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The
second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with
those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via
k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several
datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection
and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting
caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also
show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on
different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic and automatic evaluation frameworks for deep research agents, particularly for financial research problems which have distinct complexity and subtlety. Existing benchmarks do not adequately assess the capabilities of AI agents performing long-horizon tasks in the financial domain.

Method: The paper proposes FinResearchBench, a logic tree based Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of research outcomes and uses it as intermediate information for evaluation. The framework covers 70 typical financial research questions across 7 frequently encountered task types in the financial domain.

Conclusion: FinResearchBench fills the gap in evaluation frameworks for financial research agents by providing the first innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that uses logic tree extraction for comprehensive evaluation, specifically targeting the unique complexity and requirements of financial research tasks.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in
professional research applications, such as STEM, software development,
finance, etc. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as
it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity.
However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically
and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents.
Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety.
To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based
Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It
provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across
7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of
this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system
that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the
intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust
evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research
questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the
domain.

*Hyunji Nam,Omer Gottesman,Amy Zhang,Dean Foster,Emma Brunskill,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve LLM-based tutors by using latent state representations and long-term policy optimization instead of immediate turn-level preferences, achieving better outcomes in multi-turn math tutoring dialogues with less computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF frameworks for LLMs optimize responses based on immediate turn-level human preferences, which is inadequate for multi-turn dialogue settings like online math tutoring where long-term educational objectives matter more than individual response quality.

Method: The authors propose representing dialogue history with a lower-dimensional latent state representation of the student and optimizing a long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on this latent state, rather than training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output utterances.

Result: The proposed lightweight model requires less computational resources than prior work while demonstrating improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks, showing better alignment with the goal of guiding students to solve math problems independently.

Conclusion: The study shows that incorporating latent state representations and long-term policy optimization can enhance LLM-based tutors for multi-turn educational dialogues, providing a more computationally efficient approach that better serves the pedagogical objective of student independence in problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) built on existing reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF) frameworks typically optimize responses based on
immediate turn-level human preferences. However, this approach falls short in
multi-turn dialogue settings, such as online math tutoring. We propose a method
to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a
lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a
long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The
goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of
guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our
model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of
training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next
utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to
improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring
tasks.

*Yujian Sun,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an Effective Unlearning Loss method for making Large Language Models forget sensitive information while preserving their standard capabilities, achieving 5th place in SemEval 2025 Task 4 competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, there is an increasing need to make these models forget non-compliant or sensitive data that was memorized during pre-training, while maintaining their standard capabilities under limited computational resources.

Method: The authors propose an "Effective Unlearning Loss" - a more controllable forgetting loss function that can be integrated with various techniques to achieve more efficient and controlled unlearning of sensitive content from LLMs.

Result: The proposed system achieved 5th place on the SemEval 2025 Task 4 competition leaderboard, demonstrating effective performance in both forgetting sensitive information and preserving standard LLM capabilities across three unlearning datasets.

Conclusion: The Effective Unlearning Loss provides a controllable approach to machine unlearning in LLMs, successfully balancing the removal of sensitive content with the preservation of model functionality, as validated through competitive performance in the established benchmark.

Abstract: As the Large Language Model (LLM) gains widespread adoption, increasing
attention has been given to the challenge of making LLM forget non-compliant
data memorized during its pre-training. Machine Unlearning focuses on
efficiently erasing sensitive information from LLM under limited computational
resources. To advance research in this area, SemEval 2025 Task 4: "Unlearning
Sensitive Content from Large Language Models" introduces three unlearning
datasets and establishes a benchmark by evaluating both forgetting
effectiveness and the preservation of standard capabilities. In this work, we
propose a more controllable forgetting loss, Effective Unlearning Loss, and
explore its integration with various techniques to achieve more efficient and
controlled unlearning. Our system ultimately ranked 5th on the competition
leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AOE (Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to extract and organize information from complex documents into structured tables, revealing that even advanced LLMs struggle with this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs generate chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable paragraph-style answers when extracting information from complex real-world documents, failing to provide structured and organized outputs that users need.

Method: The authors created AOE, a bilingual benchmark containing 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains with documents of varying lengths. Unlike conventional text-to-table tasks with fixed schemas, AOE requires models to generate context-specific schemas tailored to varied input queries.

Result: Evaluation of both open-source and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs showed that even the most advanced models struggled significantly with the organized extraction tasks in the AOE benchmark.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to perform organized information extraction from complex documents, highlighting the need for better approaches to structured information extraction and providing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is an expectation
that LLMs can effectively extract explicit information from complex real-world
documents (e.g., papers, reports). However, most LLMs generate paragraph-style
answers that are chaotic, disorganized, and untraceable. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the Arranged and Organized Extraction Benchmark (AOE), a new
bilingual benchmark with data and documents of varying lengths designed to
systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to comprehend fragmented documents
and reconstruct isolated information into one organized table. Unlike
conventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task
domains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains,
requiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input
queries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source
state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models
struggled significantly. The benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a non-AI mathematical algorithm for language identification using monogram and bigram frequency rankings, achieving over 80% accuracy on short texts and 100% accuracy on longer/older texts, demonstrating that classical frequency-based methods remain competitive alternatives to AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid evolution of AI-powered language models dominating language identification research, non-AI approaches have been overshadowed. The authors aim to explore whether classical mathematical approaches can still be effective for language detection in an era dominated by AI solutions.

Method: Mathematical implementation of a language determination algorithm that leverages monogram and bigram frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The approach uses frequency-based analysis of character and character-pair patterns to identify languages.

Result: The method achieves over 80% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches 100% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. The algorithm was tested on diverse datasets including texts of varying length, historical period, and genre (short stories, fairy tales, and poems).

Conclusion: Classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection. The research demonstrates that non-AI mathematical methods can achieve high accuracy across different text types and lengths, suggesting these traditional approaches should not be dismissed in favor of AI solutions.

Abstract: The debate surrounding language identification has gained renewed attention
in recent years, especially with the rapid evolution of AI-powered language
models. However, the non-AI-based approaches to language identification have
been overshadowed. This research explores a mathematical implementation of an
algorithm for language determinism by leveraging monograms and bigrams
frequency rankings derived from established linguistic research. The datasets
used comprise texts varying in length, historical period, and genre, including
short stories, fairy tales, and poems. Despite these variations, the method
achieves over 80\% accuracy on texts shorter than 150 characters and reaches
100\% accuracy for longer texts and older writings. These results demonstrate
that classical frequency-based approaches remain effective and scalable
alternatives to AI-driven models for language detection.

### [21] [SpeLLM: Character-Level Multi-Head Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16323)
*Amit Ben-Artzy,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeLLM decouples input and output vocabularies in LLMs by using multiple character-level prediction heads instead of a single large output projection layer, achieving competitive performance while reducing runtime by 5.1% and enabling better support for underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM architectures face a critical bottleneck when scaling vocabulary size: the output projection layer scales linearly with vocabulary size, making substantial vocabulary expansion impractical despite its benefits for reducing input sequence length and attention's quadratic cost.

Method: SpeLLM uses multiple smaller linear heads that each predict a single character simultaneously, decoupling input and output vocabularies. The authors propose a self-distillation approach to convert standard LLMs to SpeLLM variants, where k linear heads work together to represent a much larger output space.

Result: Experiments with four pre-trained LLMs show that SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. The approach successfully maintains model quality while addressing the vocabulary scaling bottleneck.

Conclusion: SpeLLM provides a viable solution for reducing LLM computational costs while enabling better support for underrepresented languages and domains by effectively scaling vocabulary without the linear scaling penalty of traditional output projection layers.

Abstract: Scaling LLM vocabulary is often used to reduce input sequence length and
alleviate attention's quadratic cost. Yet, current LLM architectures impose a
critical bottleneck to this procedure: the output projection layer scales
linearly with vocabulary size, rendering substantial expansion impractical. We
propose SpeLLM, a method that decouples input and output vocabularies by
predicting character-level strings through multiple output heads. In SpeLLM,
each of the $k$ linear heads predicts a single character simultaneously,
enabling the model to represent a much larger output space using smaller,
independent linear heads. We present a self-distillation approach for
converting a standard LLM to a SpeLLM. Our experiments with four pre-trained
LLMs show their SpeLLM variants achieve competitive performance on downstream
tasks while reducing runtime by 5.1% on average across models. Our approach
provides a potential avenue for reducing LLM costs, while increasing support
for underrepresented languages and domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to train LLMs for formal program verification using Dafny, reducing human supervision through automatic data curation and RL with formal verifier feedback, achieving better performance than proprietary models on formal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs trained with RL face unreliable and unscalable verification processes, and providing human priors for complex programming tasks is resource-intensive. Formal language-based reasoning offers mathematically provable verification but requires reducing human supervision.

Method: The authors develop an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline combined with careful RL designs that integrate feedback from formal language verifiers. They use Dafny as the formal language environment and introduce DafnyComp benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Small models (0.5B parameters) can generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance and achieves stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks, outperforming all baselines on DafnyComp.

Conclusion: Formal language-based training with automatic data curation and RL feedback enables reliable and scalable LLM training for program verification, demonstrating that even small models can outperform large proprietary models in formal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models
(LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge:
their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are
neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models
could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted
alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous
formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,
Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their
reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving
large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to
employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the
reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes
unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex
programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human
priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot
study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data
curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the
formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional
formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification
reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models
(e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code,
surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves
performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and
outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

*Shalaka Satheesh,Katrin Klug,Katharina Beckh,Héctor Allende-Cid,Sebastian Houben,Teena Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates gender bias in German Large Language Models by translating and manually correcting an English bias benchmark dataset, finding that all tested models exhibit gender bias both supporting and opposing social stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation in NLP focuses on bias assessment, but existing benchmarks are primarily in English. German, with its grammatical gender system, presents unique challenges for bias evaluation that require specialized datasets beyond simple machine translation.

Method: The authors machine translated the gender identity subset of the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering from English to German, then manually reviewed and corrected translation errors with language expert assistance. They created two subsets: one with group terms related to gender identity and another with proper names replacing group terms.

Result: All evaluated German LLMs exhibited gender bias in both directions - supporting and opposing existing social stereotypes. The study demonstrated that manual revision of machine-translated templates is crucial for creating reliable bias evaluation datasets for languages with grammatical gender.

Conclusion: Manual correction of machine-translated bias evaluation datasets is essential when working with grammatically gendered languages like German. The created German bias benchmark successfully reveals that current German LLMs exhibit systematic gender bias, highlighting the need for continued fairness research in multilingual NLP contexts.

Abstract: Within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), fairness evaluation
is often associated with the assessment of bias and reduction of associated
harm. In this regard, the evaluation is usually carried out by using a
benchmark dataset, for a task such as Question Answering, created for the
measurement of bias in the model's predictions along various dimensions,
including gender identity. In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large
Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by
Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender
identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German.
The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and
corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of
the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation
because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language
such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two
subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity,
and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate
several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the
accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both
along and against existing social stereotypes.

### [24] [PromptAL: Sample-Aware Dynamic Soft Prompts for Few-Shot Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16424)
*Hui Xiang,Jinqiao Shi,Ting Zhang,Xiaojie Zhao,Yong Liu,Yong Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptAL is a hybrid active learning framework that uses sample-aware dynamic soft prompts to better align empirical distribution with target distribution in few-shot scenarios, leading to improved sample selection and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In few-shot active learning scenarios, the empirical distribution of labeled data often diverges significantly from the target distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal position. Existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in enhancing the empirical distribution, resulting in suboptimal decision boundaries and poor sample selection that inadequately represents the target distribution.

Method: PromptAL leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that better represent the target distribution.

Result: Experimental results on six in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets demonstrate that PromptAL achieves superior performance compared to nine baseline methods across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed PromptAL framework successfully addresses the distribution mismatch problem in few-shot active learning by utilizing unlabeled data through dynamic soft prompts, leading to better decision boundaries and more effective sample selection strategies.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL
methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the
decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently
identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the
empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target
distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal
position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in
enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target
distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of
samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this,
we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware
Dynamic Soft \textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning).
This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in
aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,
thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first
leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that
adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,
based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation
with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more
accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six
in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior
performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.

### [25] [Dutch CrowS-Pairs: Adapting a Challenge Dataset for Measuring Social Biases in Language Models for Dutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16442)
*Elza Strazda,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Dutch version of the CrowS-Pairs dataset to measure bias in Dutch language models, finding that various Dutch models exhibit substantial bias across 9 categories, with English models showing the most bias and Dutch models the least, while also demonstrating that assigning personas to models affects their bias levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to ensure safe and fair language models as they become increasingly popular and widely applied. While considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language models, most studies have focused only on English, creating a gap in understanding bias in other languages like Dutch.

Method: The researchers created a Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset consisting of 1463 sentence pairs covering 9 bias categories (Sexual orientation, Gender, Disability, etc.). They used contrasting sentences where one concerns disadvantaged groups and the other advantaged groups. They evaluated various language models (BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje, Mistral-7B) and compared results with English and French versions of CrowS-Pairs on respective language models.

Result: The study found that all tested Dutch language models exhibit substantial bias across various categories. Comparative analysis revealed that English models exhibit the most bias, while Dutch models show the least amount of bias. The research also demonstrated that assigning personas to language models changes their bias levels, indicating variability across languages and contexts.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that bias varies significantly across languages and contexts, suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in shaping model biases. This emphasizes the importance of language-specific bias evaluation and the need for culturally aware approaches to developing fair language models.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes
which might be upsetting.
  Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and
harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of
these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of
recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language
models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A
Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in
Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463
sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation,
Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting
sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the
other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that
various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and
Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using
the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated
in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language
models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas
Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that
assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.
These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts,
suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in
shaping model biases.

*Naama Zwerdling,David Boaz,Ella Rabinovich,Guy Uziel,David Amid,Ateret Anaby-Tavor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to ensure LLM agents follow business policies by compiling policy documents into verifiable guard code that checks compliance before each agent action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents show promise for business process automation but struggle to reliably follow complex company policies, creating a need for deterministic policy enforcement mechanisms.

Method: A two-phase framework: (1) offline compilation of policy documents into verifiable guard code associated with tool use, and (2) runtime integration where guards ensure compliance before each agent action. The approach is deterministic, transparent, and modular.

Result: Preliminary evaluation on the τ-bench Airlines domain shows encouraging results in policy enforcement, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enforces business policy adherence in agentic workflows, though key challenges remain for real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents hold promise for a flexible and scalable
alternative to traditional business process automation, but struggle to
reliably follow complex company policies. In this study we introduce a
deterministic, transparent, and modular framework for enforcing business policy
adherence in agentic workflows. Our method operates in two phases: (1) an
offline buildtime stage that compiles policy documents into verifiable guard
code associated with tool use, and (2) a runtime integration where these guards
ensure compliance before each agent action. We demonstrate our approach on the
challenging $\tau$-bench Airlines domain, showing encouraging preliminary
results in policy enforcement, and further outline key challenges for
real-world deployments.

### [27] [ICR Probe: Tracking Hidden State Dynamics for Reliable Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16488)
*Zhenliang Zhang,Xinyu Hu,Huixuan Zhang,Junzhe Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ICR Score and ICR Probe method to detect hallucinations in large language models by analyzing how hidden states evolve across layers, achieving better performance with fewer parameters than existing static detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods focus on static and isolated hidden state representations, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers, which limits their effectiveness in reliably detecting when LLMs generate false or fabricated information.

Method: The authors introduce the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream) metric that quantifies how much each module contributes to hidden state updates, and develop the ICR Probe that captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states to detect hallucinations.

Result: The ICR Probe achieves superior hallucination detection performance compared to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters. The ICR Score is empirically validated as effective and reliable for distinguishing hallucinations.

Conclusion: By shifting focus from static representations to the dynamic hidden state update process across layers, the ICR-based approach provides a more effective and interpretable solution for hallucination detection in LLMs, with improved performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their
reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states
predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their
dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this
limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce
a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),
which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We
empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in
distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a
hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer
evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe
achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,
ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying
mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.

### [28] [Combining Language and Topic Models for Hierarchical Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16490)
*Jaco du Toit,Marcel Dunaiski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether combining pre-trained language models (PLMs) with topic models improves hierarchical text classification performance, finding that topic model features generally decrease rather than improve classification accuracy compared to using PLMs alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work suggested that combining PLMs with topic models is effective for multi-label text classification, as PLMs capture fine-grained contextual information while topic models provide high-level corpus-wide representations. The authors wanted to systematically evaluate whether this combination truly benefits hierarchical text classification performance.

Method: The approach uses both a PLM and topic model to extract features from text documents. These features are processed through separate convolutional layers, then combined and fed into label-wise attention mechanisms that generate label-specific document representations by weighing important features for each class separately. The method was tested on three HTC benchmark datasets.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three hierarchical text classification benchmark datasets showed that incorporating features from topic models generally decreased classification performance compared to using only PLM-extracted features. This contradicts previous assumptions about the benefits of combining these approaches.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the incorporation of topic model features for hierarchical text classification should not be assumed beneficial, challenging previous work that suggested this combination was effective. Using PLM features alone appears to be more effective for HTC tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task
which has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes
from a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various
techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the
natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models
along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an
effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale
behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM
captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic
model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents
as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic
model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a
classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of
the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in
general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate
convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise
attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by
weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform
comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using
the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification
performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In
contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features
extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed
beneficial.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EESE (Ever-Evolving Science Exam), a dynamic benchmark with over 100K science questions across 5 disciplines to evaluate foundation models' scientific understanding while addressing data leakage and evaluation inefficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing science benchmarks face two major challenges: data leakage risks that compromise benchmarking validity, and evaluation inefficiency due to large-scale testing. As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, there's an increasing need for reliable assessment of their scientific understanding.

Method: The approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public EESE-Pool with over 100K expertly constructed science instances across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring Range, Reach, and Rigor, and 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset EESE, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.

Result: Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions, providing reliable assessment while addressing the identified challenges.

Conclusion: EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions while mitigating data leakage and evaluation efficiency concerns.

Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating
their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science
benchmarks have made progress towards broad **Range**, wide **Reach**, and high
**Rigor**, yet they often face two major challenges: **data leakage risks**
that compromise benchmarking validity, and **evaluation inefficiency** due to
large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving
Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess
scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two
components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed
science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+
subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**,
and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled
and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.
Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE
effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific
fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and
forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic

### [30] [Introducing Quality Estimation to Machine Translation Post-editing Workflow: An Empirical Study on Its Usefulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16515)
*Siqi Liu,Guangrong Dai,Dechao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how sentence-level Quality Estimation (QE) affects English-Chinese machine translation post-editing, finding that QE significantly reduces post-editing time and consistently improves efficiency across different MT quality levels and translator expertise, though inaccurate QE can hinder the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the practical usefulness of Quality Estimation in machine translation post-editing workflows, particularly examining its impact on efficiency and how it interacts with different levels of MT quality and translator expertise in English-Chinese translation.

Method: A preliminary study examining sentence-level Quality Estimation in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing, analyzing post-editing speed, student translator perceptions, and interaction effects between QE and MT quality as well as between QE and translation expertise through empirical testing and interviews.

Result: QE significantly reduces post-editing time and consistently improves MTPE efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs regardless of translator expertise level. QE serves multiple functions including identifying problematic segments, validating translator evaluations, and enabling quality double-checking, though inaccurate QE can hinder the post-editing process.

Conclusion: Quality Estimation is a valuable tool for improving machine translation post-editing efficiency, providing consistent benefits across different conditions. However, QE accuracy is crucial for effectiveness, and understanding both its strengths and limitations is essential for successful integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translator productivity.

Abstract: This preliminary study investigates the usefulness of sentence-level Quality
Estimation (QE) in English-Chinese Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE),
focusing on its impact on post-editing speed and student translators'
perceptions. It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT
quality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal
that QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction
effects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE
efficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student
translators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating
potentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as
validating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to
double-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that
inaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new
insights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more
effective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity.

TL;DR: This thesis develops computational methods for text style manipulation through three main areas: text style transfer, authorship attribution, and authorship verification, using large language models with parameter-efficient adaptation and contrastive learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to computationally understand and manipulate text styles across three critical tasks: changing stylistic properties while preserving content, identifying authors through stylistic patterns, and verifying shared authorship between texts.

Method: Parameter-efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs), contrastive disentanglement of stylistic features, and instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification across the three interconnected pillars of text style analysis.

Result: The thesis addresses critical challenges in text style transfer, authorship attribution, and authorship verification through the proposed computational framework integrating LLMs with specialized adaptation techniques.

Conclusion: The research successfully advances computational text style understanding by creating an integrated approach that connects style transfer, authorship attribution, and verification through efficient LLM adaptation and contrastive learning methods.

Abstract: This thesis advances the computational understanding and manipulation of text
styles through three interconnected pillars: (1) Text Style Transfer (TST),
which alters stylistic properties (e.g., sentiment, formality) while preserving
content; (2)Authorship Attribution (AA), identifying the author of a text via
stylistic fingerprints; and (3) Authorship Verification (AV), determining
whether two texts share the same authorship. We address critical challenges in
these areas by leveraging parameter-efficient adaptation of large language
models (LLMs), contrastive disentanglement of stylistic features, and
instruction-based fine-tuning for explainable verification.

*Kristin Gnadt,David Thulke,Simone Kopeinik,Ralf Schlüter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents five German datasets for evaluating gender bias in large language models (LLMs), revealing unique challenges in German language bias detection including ambiguous male occupational terms and neutral nouns affecting gender perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gender bias evaluation methods for LLMs were primarily developed for English, creating a transferability challenge when applied to other languages. There was a need for language-specific evaluation frameworks to properly assess gender bias in multilingual LLMs, particularly for German.

Method: The authors developed five German datasets grounded in established gender bias concepts and made them accessible through multiple evaluation methodologies. They tested these datasets on eight multilingual LLM models to assess gender bias patterns specific to the German language.

Result: The evaluation revealed unique German-specific challenges in gender bias detection, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. The findings demonstrate distinct bias patterns across the eight tested multilingual LLM models.

Conclusion: The work contributes to understanding gender bias in LLMs across different languages and emphasizes the necessity for developing tailored, language-specific evaluation frameworks rather than relying solely on English-based methods for multilingual bias assessment.

Abstract: In recent years, various methods have been proposed to evaluate gender bias
in large language models (LLMs). A key challenge lies in the transferability of
bias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when
applied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research
strand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs.
The datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are
accessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight
multilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias
in German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms
and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work
contributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and
underscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.

### [33] [Pixels to Principles: Probing Intuitive Physics Understanding in Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16572)
*Mohamad Ballout,Serwan Jassim,Elia Bruni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates state-of-the-art multimodal large language models on intuitive physics tasks and finds that vision-language misalignment, rather than vision encoding limitations, is the primary cause of poor performance in physical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with intuitive physics reasoning tasks, but the underlying causes of these failures are not well understood. The authors aim to systematically evaluate MLLMs and identify whether the problem lies in vision encoding or vision-language integration.

Method: The researchers conducted systematic evaluation of four MLLMs (InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) using GRASP and IntPhys 2 datasets. They performed probing analysis of model embeddings by extracting intermediate representations at key processing stages to examine information preservation and utilization.

Result: All tested models, including the latest versions, struggled to reliably distinguish physically plausible from implausible scenarios. The probing analysis revealed that vision encoders successfully capture physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by the language model component, creating a critical vision-language misalignment.

Conclusion: The primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic information. Vision-language alignment emerges as a key area requiring improvement for future MLLM development to enhance physical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) on intuitive physics tasks using the GRASP and
IntPhys 2 datasets. We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that
even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible
from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a
probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations
at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is
preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical
vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture
physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by
the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment
suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not
the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic
information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for
improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.

*Armin Berger,Lars Hillebrand,David Leonhard,Tobias Deußer,Thiago Bell Felix de Oliveira,Tim Dilmaghani,Mohamed Khaled,Bernd Kliem,Rüdiger Loitz,Christian Bauckhage,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of open-source vs proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) for regulatory compliance verification in financial auditing, finding that while Llama-2 70B excels at detecting non-compliance, GPT-4 performs best overall, especially in non-English contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven financial auditing systems can recommend relevant text passages from financial reports but fail to verify whether these excerpts actually comply with specific legal mandates and accounting standards, creating a critical gap in automated compliance verification.

Method: Comparative analysis of publicly available Large Language Models across different configurations, specifically comparing open-source models (Llama-2) with proprietary models (OpenAI's GPT series) using two custom datasets provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Germany for regulatory compliance tasks.

Result: Open-source Llama-2 70 billion parameter model showed outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance cases (true negatives), outperforming all proprietary counterparts in this specific task. However, proprietary models like GPT-4 demonstrated superior performance across a broader variety of scenarios, particularly excelling in non-English language contexts.

Conclusion: While open-source models like Llama-2 can match or exceed proprietary models in specific compliance detection tasks, proprietary models such as GPT-4 maintain overall superiority in diverse regulatory compliance scenarios, especially for multilingual applications in financial auditing.

Abstract: The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process,
stands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made
inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages
from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting
standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall
short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific
legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly
available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance
across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on
comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their
proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis
leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model
demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true
negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless,
proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of
scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompting method to enhance phonological reasoning in text-based large language models, achieving up to 52% improvement on tasks like rhyme generation and syllable counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based large language models lack explicit phonological information, yet phonological reasoning is crucial for language understanding. The study aims to explore and enhance LLMs' latent phonological abilities through improved prompting strategies.

Method: The researchers developed a Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompting approach based on educational theories like scaffolding and discovery learning. They evaluated this method against few-shot learning using the PhonologyBench benchmark across 12 different LLMs on tasks including rhyme word generation, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, and syllable counting.

Result: The P-CoT prompting method consistently enhanced performance across all tested LLMs, achieving up to 52% improvement over baseline methods. The approach even surpassed human performance baselines on certain phonological tasks, while few-shot learning showed inconsistent gains.

Conclusion: Pedagogically-motivated prompting strategies can effectively activate and enhance latent phonological reasoning capabilities in text-based LLMs. The P-CoT method provides a promising approach for improving phonological tasks, with potential for optimization and broader application across different linguistic domains.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of phonological reasoning within text-based
large language models (LLMs). Utilizing the PhonologyBench benchmark, we assess
tasks like rhyme word generation, g2p conversion, and syllable counting. Our
evaluations across 12 LLMs reveal that while few-shot learning offers
inconsistent gains, the introduction of a novel Pedagogically-motivated
Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompt, which is anchored in educational
theories like scaffolding and discovery learning, consistently enhances
performance. This method leverages structured guidance to activate latent
phonological abilities, achieving up to 52% improvement and even surpassing
human baselines in certain tasks. Future work could aim to optimize P-CoT
prompts for specific models or explore their application across different
linguistic domains.

### [37] [Self-Contradiction as Self-Improvement: Mitigating the Generation-Understanding Gap in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16663)
*Yujin Han,Hao Chen,Andi Han,Zhiheng Wang,Xinyu Lin,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a "Nonunified score" to measure self-contradiction in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where models generate images that their own understanding component deems misaligned with prompts. The authors leverage this self-contradiction for model improvement through internal supervision and propose a curriculum-based training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction between their generation and understanding capabilities - they generate images that their own understanding component considers misaligned with input prompts. This asymmetry between generation (weaker) and understanding (stronger) capabilities presents an opportunity for self-improvement by using the model's stronger understanding to guide its weaker generation.

Method: The authors define a "Nonunified score" to quantify self-contradiction in MLLMs. They apply standard post-training methods (SFT, DPO) with internal supervision from the model's understanding component to improve generation. They also propose a curriculum-based strategy that gradually introduces harder samples as the model improves, and analyze the co-improvement/co-degradation effects between generation and understanding branches.

Result: The study reveals that self-contradiction mainly stems from weak generation rather than misunderstanding. Post-training with internal supervision successfully improves both generation and unification. A co-improvement effect is observed where fine-tuning only the generation branch also improves understanding. However, poor supervision can lead to co-degradation, and intrinsic metrics cannot distinguish between co-improvement and co-degradation, highlighting the need for data quality checks.

Conclusion: The capability asymmetry in MLLMs can be leveraged for self-improvement through internal supervision. The proposed curriculum-based strategy leads to better unification and improved MLLM performance in both generation and understanding. However, careful attention to supervision quality is crucial to avoid co-degradation effects, and data quality monitoring is essential for reliable evaluation.

Abstract: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a
single model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation
produces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own
understanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such
self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction
mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather
than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of
leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model
understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the
generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,
SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation
and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and
understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known
in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows
improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously
incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned
training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced
prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the
understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of
co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is
empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics
like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,
which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a
curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces

### [38] [PICACO: Pluralistic In-Context Value Alignment of LLMs via Total Correlation Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16679)
*Han Jiang,Dongyao Zhu,Zhihua Wei,Xiaoyuan Yi,Ziang Xiao,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PICACO is a novel In-Context Alignment method that addresses the challenge of conflicting human values in LLM alignment by optimizing meta-instructions to better balance multiple values simultaneously without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current In-Context Alignment methods face the "Instruction Bottleneck" challenge where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple conflicting human values (e.g., stimulation vs. tradition) within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment due to the pluralistic nature of human values.

Method: PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise to create effective value instructions without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on five value sets demonstrate that PICACO works effectively with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves better balance across up to 8 distinct values.

Conclusion: PICACO successfully addresses the value tension problem in LLM alignment by providing a pluralistic approach that can handle multiple conflicting values simultaneously, offering a practical solution for aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences without costly post-training.

Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate
diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment
(ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting
ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently
pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.
tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck
challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a
single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we
propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO
optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit
LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by
maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,
theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,
resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value
sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,
outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance
across up to 8 distinct values.

### [41] [RAVine: Reality-Aligned Evaluation for Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16725)
*Yilong Xu,Xiang Long,Zhi Zheng,Jinhua Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAVine is a new evaluation framework for agentic search systems that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by using realistic queries, accurate ground truth construction, and evaluating both final answers and iterative search processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for agentic search systems have three major limitations: (1) complex queries that don't reflect realistic user scenarios, (2) noisy ground truth extraction that distorts fine-grained assessments, and (3) focus only on final answer quality while ignoring the iterative search process evaluation.

Method: The paper proposes RAVine, a reality-aligned evaluation framework that: (1) targets multi-point queries and long-form answers that better reflect user intents, (2) introduces an attributable ground truth construction strategy for accurate fine-grained evaluation, and (3) examines model interaction with search tools throughout the iterative process while accounting for efficiency factors.

Result: The authors benchmark a series of models using RAVine and derive several insights that contribute to understanding agentic search system performance. The framework provides more accurate and comprehensive evaluation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: RAVine successfully addresses the key limitations of existing evaluation frameworks for agentic search systems by providing a more realistic, accurate, and comprehensive evaluation approach that considers both answer quality and search process efficiency.

Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval
augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However,
existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic
search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often
deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to
introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,
leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current
frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the
evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address
these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework
for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form
answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground
truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation.
Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the
iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a
series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will
contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

### [42] [Unpacking Ambiguity: The Interaction of Polysemous Discourse Markers and Non-DM Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16748)
*Jingni Wu,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how polysemous discourse markers (DMs) interact with non-DM signals in English text, finding that polysemous DMs co-occur with more diverse but not necessarily more numerous non-DM signals, with genre significantly affecting these patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discourse markers are essential for discourse coherence but often have ambiguous meanings and can be replaced by or co-occur with non-DM signals. The interaction mechanism between these signals remains unclear, making it important to understand how DM polysemy relates to non-DM signal co-occurrence for better disambiguation.

Method: The authors use the eRST framework to propose a graded definition of DM polysemy and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine the relationship between polysemous DMs and co-occurring non-DM signals in English, also investigating the influence of genre on these patterns.

Result: Polysemous discourse markers co-occur with more diverse non-DM signals, but the total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Genre plays a significant role in shaping the interactions between discourse markers and other signals.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that DM polysemy correlates with increased diversity (but not quantity) of non-DM signals, and that genre significantly influences DM-signal interaction patterns, providing insights into discourse coherence mechanisms and signal disambiguation processes.

Abstract: Discourse markers (DMs) like 'but' or 'then' are crucial for creating
coherence in discourse, yet they are often replaced by or co-occur with non-DMs
('in the morning' can mean the same as 'then'), and both can be ambiguous
('since' can refer to time or cause). The interaction mechanism between such
signals remains unclear but pivotal for their disambiguation. In this paper we
investigate the relationship between DM polysemy and co-occurrence of non-DM
signals in English, as well as the influence of genre on these patterns.
  Using the framework of eRST, we propose a graded definition of DM polysemy,
and conduct correlation and regression analyses to examine whether polysemous
DMs are accompanied by more numerous and diverse non-DM signals. Our findings
reveal that while polysemous DMs do co-occur with more diverse non-DMs, the
total number of co-occurring signals does not necessarily increase. Moreover,
genre plays a significant role in shaping DM-signal interactions.

*Hongyin Luo,Nathaniel Morgan,Tina Li,Derek Zhao,Ai Vy Ngo,Philip Schroeder,Lijie Yang,Assaf Ben-Kish,Jack O'Brien,James Glass*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIM (Thread Inference Model) and TIMRUN runtime to overcome context limits in large language models by using recursive reasoning trees and selective memory management, enabling unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls for long-horizon reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face bottlenecks in reasoning accuracy and efficiency due to context limits, output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks that prevent effective long-horizon structured reasoning.

Method: The approach models natural language as reasoning trees (with tasks, thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions) instead of linear sequences, combined with a working memory system that retains only key-value states of most relevant context tokens using rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism for efficient GPU memory reuse.

Result: The system maintains high inference throughput while manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory, delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks, and successfully handles information retrieval challenges requiring long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.

Conclusion: TIM and TIMRUN successfully break context limits of LLMs by implementing recursive decompositional problem solving with efficient memory management, enabling virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within single model inference for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck
reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM),
a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and
TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond
context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited
working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model
inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and
GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as
reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.
The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and
conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During
generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states
of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning
mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages
throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high
inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU
memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles
information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and
multi-hop tool use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free framework for role-playing language agents that automatically decouples character features into personality, memory, and linguistic style to achieve high-fidelity character role-playing without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current role-playing language agents face limitations: prompt-based approaches lack deep immersion in specific roles (especially well-known fictional or public figures), while fine-tuning approaches are restricted by data collection challenges and computational resource requirements, limiting their broader applicability.

Method: Test-Time-Matching (TTM) is a training-free framework that uses LLM agents to automatically decouple character features into three components: personality, memory, and linguistic style. It employs a structured three-stage generation pipeline utilizing these features for controlled role-playing through test-time scaling and context engineering.

Result: The framework achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance and enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and variations in personality and memory. Human assessment evaluations demonstrate outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

Conclusion: TTM successfully addresses the limitations of existing role-playing approaches by providing a training-free solution that achieves deep character immersion through systematic feature decomposition and controlled generation, demonstrating superior performance in character dialogue generation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled
role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various
applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often
proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles,
particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand,
fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated
with data collection and the computational resources required for training,
thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we
propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework
through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to
automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and
linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation
pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves
high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations
across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.
We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate
that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive
and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts is challenging because it requires understanding the complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. Current approaches may not adequately balance these different types of information based on their relative importance or expressivity.

Method: The authors develop a salience-adjusted framework that integrates Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information. The weighting is based on the expressivity of facial cues, allowing the system to adaptively prioritize different information sources.

### [50] [PAT++: a cautionary tale about generative visual augmentation for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15888)
*Leonardo Santiago Benitez Pereira,Arathy Jeevan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates generative data augmentation for object re-identification using a novel PAT++ pipeline that incorporates Diffusion Self-Distillation into Part-Aware Transformer, finding that generated images consistently degrade performance due to domain shifts and loss of identity-defining features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative data augmentation has shown success in various vision tasks, its effectiveness for object re-identification remains unexplored. Object re-identification requires preserving fine-grained visual details that are essential for identity recognition, making it a challenging application for generative models.

Method: The authors propose PAT++, a novel pipeline that incorporates Diffusion Self-Distillation into the established Part-Aware Transformer architecture. They conduct extensive experiments using the Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, applying generated images for both model training and query expansion to assess identity-preserving image generation effectiveness.

Result: The experiments reveal consistent performance degradation when using generated images for object re-identification. The degradation is attributed to domain shifts between real and generated images, and the failure of generative models to retain critical identity-defining features necessary for accurate re-identification.

Conclusion: The findings challenge common assumptions about the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks. The study exposes significant limitations in current visual augmentation approaches for identity-preserving applications, suggesting that generative data augmentation may not be suitable for tasks requiring precise identity discrimination like object re-identification.

Abstract: Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.

### [51] [Local Dense Logit Relations for Enhanced Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15911)
*Liuchi Xu,Kang Liu,Jinshuai Liu,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a knowledge distillation method that captures fine-grained inter-class relationships in logits through recursive decoupling and recombining, combined with an Adaptive Decay Weight strategy to improve student model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logit distillation methods have not thoroughly explored fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge, missing opportunities to provide more detailed and clearer insights for student learning through better understanding of inter-class relationships.

Method: The method introduces LDRLD that recursively decouples and recombines logit information to capture inter-class relationships, combined with an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and Exponential Rank Decay (ERD) to dynamically adjust weights for critical category pairs, plus distillation of remaining non-target knowledge for completeness.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably with state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches, showing improved student model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed LDRLD method successfully improves student model performance by transferring fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical inter-class relationships, outperforming existing state-of-the-art logit distillation methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for early mpox detection using transfer learning and Grad-CAM explainability, achieving 95% accuracy with InceptionV3 on binary classification and 93% with MobileNetV2 on multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mpox diagnosis is challenging due to its similarity with other skin conditions, and while AI shows promise for medical image analysis, pre-trained CNN models and explainable AI (XAI) techniques for mpox detection remain underexplored, creating a need for effective automated diagnostic tools.

Method: The study applied transfer learning to fine-tune four pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) by freezing initial layers and adding custom layers. Two datasets (MSLD and MSLD v2.0) were used for training and validation, with Grad-CAM employed for model interpretability and visualization of critical image features.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved the highest performance on binary classification with 95% accuracy, while MobileNetV2 performed best on multi-class classification with 93% accuracy. Grad-CAM successfully highlighted key image regions for interpretation. However, some models showed overfitting tendencies with discrepancies between training and validation losses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of pre-trained CNN models for mpox detection and validates the value of XAI techniques for interpretability. Future research should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data, and explore additional interpretability methods to enhance diagnostic reliability and model transparency.

Abstract: Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis

InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.

*Ahmed Aman Ibrahim,Hamad Mansour Alawar,Abdulnasser Abbas Zehi,Ahmed Mohammad Alkendi,Bilal Shafi Ashfaq Ahmed Mirza,Shan Ullah,Ismail Lujain Jaleel,Hassan Ugail*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight face quality assessment framework using normalized facial landmarks and Random Forest Regression achieves 96.67% accuracy in filtering low-quality face images, resulting in 99.7% reduction in false rejection rates when integrated with ArcFace face verification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-quality face images caused by motion blur, poor lighting, occlusions, and extreme pose variations significantly degrade face recognition performance, leading to higher false rejection and false acceptance rates in real-time screening applications like surveillance and access control systems.

Method: The framework employs normalized facial landmarks combined with a Random Forest Regression classifier to automatically assess face image quality and pre-filter low-quality images before they enter the verification pipeline.

Result: The system achieved 96.67% accuracy in quality assessment and demonstrated 99.7% reduction in false rejection rates with enhanced cosine similarity scores when integrated with ArcFace. Experiments were validated on a real-world dataset of over 600 subjects from Dubai Police CCTV footage.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates poor-quality face image impacts, outperforms existing quality assessment techniques while maintaining computational efficiency, and successfully addresses face resolution variations and pose deviations in practical surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

### [54] [FW-VTON: Flattening-and-Warping for Person-to-Person Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16010)
*Zheng Wang,Xianbing Sun,Shengyi Wu,Jiahui Zhan,Jianlou Si,Chi Zhang,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FW-VTON, a novel person-to-person virtual try-on method that transfers garments between two people using a three-stage approach: garment extraction, pose-based warping, and seamless integration, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on methods focus on garment-to-person tasks requiring flat garment representations, but there's a need for person-to-person try-on that only uses two input images (target person and source person wearing the garment) without requiring separate flat garment images.

Method: FW-VTON operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the source person image, (2) warping the extracted garment to align with the target person's pose, and (3) seamlessly integrating the warped garment onto the target person. The authors also created a new dataset specifically for person-to-person try-on scenarios.

Result: FW-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance in person-to-person virtual try-on with superior results in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The method also excels in garment extraction subtasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed FW-VTON successfully addresses the person-to-person virtual try-on challenge by introducing a three-stage pipeline that can effectively transfer garments between individuals using only two input images, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.

### [55] [Is Tracking really more challenging in First Person Egocentric Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16015)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Zaira Manigrasso,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark study to separate challenges specific to first-person egocentric vision from general human-object activity understanding in visual tracking and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research claimed egocentric vision presents unique challenges for object tracking and segmentation, but these conclusions were based on evaluations across significantly different scenarios. The authors question whether performance drops are due to the first-person viewpoint itself or the broader domain of human-object activities, since many challenging characteristics are present in both egocentric and third-person videos.

Method: The authors develop a new benchmark study with an evaluation strategy that enables precise separation of challenges related to first-person perspective from those linked to human-object activity understanding. This disentangles factors that were previously confounded in egocentric vision evaluations.

Result: The benchmark provides deeper insights into the true sources of difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation by isolating first-person viewpoint challenges from general human-object activity challenges.

Conclusion: By disentangling these factors, the study facilitates more targeted advancements in egocentric vision tasks by identifying the actual sources of difficulty rather than attributing all challenges to the egocentric viewpoint.

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.

### [56] [Artifacts and Attention Sinks: Structured Approximations for Efficient Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16018)
*Andrew Lu,Wentinn Liao,Liuhui Wang,Huzheng Yang,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates massive tokens and artifact tokens in vision transformers, revealing how they suppress each other through attention mechanisms, and proposes Fast Nyström Attention (FNA) - a training-free method that achieves linear time/space complexity while maintaining competitive performance across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers' inner workings remain partially understood, particularly the role of massive tokens (with high activation norms acting as attention sinks) and artifact tokens that emerge during inference. Understanding these phenomena could lead to more efficient attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors analyze the mutual suppression between massive and artifact tokens through attention mechanisms, then develop Fast Nyström Attention (FNA) - a training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space by exploiting structured patterns of these tokens. They also propose a masking strategy to reduce noise from these tokens.

Result: FNA demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question answering (VQA) tasks using popular pretrained vision backbones, while significantly reducing computational overhead through linear time and space complexity.

Conclusion: The study reveals that massive and artifact tokens play a critical role in regulating information flow in vision transformers through mutual suppression. The proposed FNA method successfully exploits these insights to achieve efficient attention approximation without training, maintaining performance while reducing computational costs across diverse vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.

### [57] [Discovering and using Spelke segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16038)
*Rahul Venkatesh,Klemen Kotar,Lilian Naing Chen,Seungwoo Kim,Luca Thomas Wheeler,Jared Watrous,Ashley Xu,Gia Ancone,Wanhee Lee,Honglin Chen,Daniel Bear,Stefan Stojanov,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpelkeNet, a model that segments images based on Spelke objects (things that move together physically) rather than semantic categories, using motion prediction to identify objects that would move coherently when poked, achieving better performance than semantic segmentation methods on manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision segmentation relies on semantic categories and conventions, but this may not be optimal for physical tasks like manipulation and planning. The authors are motivated by developmental psychology research on Spelke objects - groupings of physical things that move together when acted upon by forces - which could provide better category-agnostic segmentation based on causal motion relationships.

Method: The authors develop SpelkeNet, a visual world model trained to predict future motion distributions. The method uses "statistical counterfactual probing" by applying virtual pokes to regions with high motion affordance and analyzing the resulting expected displacement maps. Key components include: (1) motion affordance maps identifying regions likely to move under interaction, and (2) expected-displacement maps showing how the scene would move, which together define Spelke segments through correlated motion statistics.

Result: SpelkeNet outperforms supervised baselines including SegmentAnything (SAM) on the newly introduced SpelkeBench dataset. The Spelke object concept also demonstrates practical utility, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for physical object manipulation when integrated with various off-the-shelf manipulation models.

Conclusion: Spelke objects provide a more physically-grounded approach to image segmentation that better supports manipulation and planning tasks compared to traditional semantic segmentation. The proposed SpelkeNet successfully extracts these physically meaningful segments and demonstrates improved performance on both segmentation benchmarks and downstream manipulation applications.

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

### [58] [Disrupting Semantic and Abstract Features for Better Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16052)
*Yuyang Luo,Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Yingzhe He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAFER, a balanced approach that improves adversarial example transferability by disrupting both semantic and abstract (high-frequency) features using BLOCKMIX and SELF-MIX techniques when computing feature importance weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-level adversarial attacks primarily focus on manipulating semantic information when computing weight matrices, but CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (abstract features like texture and edges). The authors aim to improve transferability by considering both semantic and abstract features.

Method: SAFER (Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption) conducts BLOCKMIX on input images and SELF-MIX on frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix. This highlights crucial features and directs the attacker to disrupt both semantic and abstract features simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that SAFER effectively boosts adversarial transferability compared to existing feature-level attacks that only focus on semantic information.

Conclusion: By balancing the disruption of both semantic and abstract features through frequency domain transformations, SAFER achieves improved transferability in black-box adversarial attacks against deep neural networks.

Abstract: Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.

### [59] [Improving Personalized Image Generation through Social Context Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16095)
*Parul Gupta,Abhinav Dhall,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feedback-based fine-tuning approach for personalized image generation that uses state-of-the-art detectors (pose, human-object-interaction, facial recognition, and gaze estimation) to improve the quality of generated images, particularly addressing issues with complex activities, identity preservation, and natural gaze patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generation methods suffer from three major limitations: (1) complex activities are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, (2) reference human identities are not preserved, and (3) generated human gaze patterns are unnatural/inconsistent with scene descriptions.

Method: The authors propose feedback-based fine-tuning of existing personalized generation methods using state-of-the-art detectors for pose, human-object-interaction, human facial recognition, and human gaze-point estimation to refine the diffusion model. They also introduce timestep-based incorporation of different feedback modules based on whether the signal is low-level (e.g., human pose) or high-level (e.g., gaze point).

Result: The generated images show improvement in interactions, facial identities, and overall image quality across three benchmark datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Feedback-based fine-tuning using multiple specialized detectors can effectively address key limitations in personalized image generation, leading to better preservation of human identities, more accurate complex activities, and more natural gaze patterns in generated images.

Abstract: Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.

*Yaofang Liu,Yumeng Ren,Aitor Artola,Yuxuan Hu,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaotong Zhao,Alan Zhao,Raymond H. Chan,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Dandan Tu,Jean-Michel Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pusa introduces vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) for video diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image-to-video generation performance with dramatically reduced training costs (1/200th) and dataset requirements (1/2500th) while enabling zero-shot multi-task capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models face fundamental limitations in temporal modeling due to rigid synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep variables, leading to computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability in existing solutions.

Method: The paper presents vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA), a non-destructive adaptation technique that enables fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework by finetuning the Wan2.1-T2V-14B model while preserving the base model's capabilities.

Result: Pusa achieves a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32% (vs. 86.86% of Wan-I2V-14B) with only $500 training cost (vs. ≥$100,000) and 4K dataset samples (vs. ≥10M samples), while unlocking zero-shot capabilities including start-end frames, video extension, and text-to-video generation.

Conclusion: The work establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for video synthesis that preserves foundation model generative priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, democratizing high-fidelity video generation and setting new standards for next-generation video diffusion models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

TL;DR: LongSplat is an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework that enables efficient novel view synthesis for long image sequences by using a streaming update mechanism with Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR) to incrementally integrate observations while compressing redundant historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are limited in online long-sequence scenarios due to slow per-scene optimization or lack of efficient incremental updates, which hinders continuous performance in real-time applications.

Method: The method introduces a streaming update mechanism with Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR) that encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured 2D image-like format. This enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical Gaussians, identity-aware redundancy compression, and leverages existing image compression methods for generating compact, high-quality 3D Gaussians.

Result: LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts by 44% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LongSplat framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods in long-sequence scenarios by providing an efficient online reconstruction solution that maintains high quality while significantly reducing computational and memory costs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without
overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an
existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and
higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view
synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts
by 44\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first video action recognition dataset using spike cameras, synchronized with RGB and thermal data, to benchmark Spiking Neural Networks and advance energy-efficient video understanding research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite spike cameras offering ultra-high energy efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution compared to event cameras, there was no existing video action recognition dataset specifically designed for spike camera data to enable comprehensive benchmarking of Spiking Neural Networks and multimodal video understanding.

Method: The authors created a novel video action recognition dataset that captures data from spike cameras synchronized with RGB and thermal modalities, preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data to enable direct comparison across different sensing modalities.

Result: The work successfully established three synchronized datasets (spike, RGB, thermal) that provide a unique platform for exploring multimodal video understanding and serve as a valuable resource for comparing different sensing modalities in action recognition tasks.

Conclusion: This contribution provides a novel dataset that will drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding, specifically advancing action recognition tasks using spike-based data and enabling comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks.

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,
thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will
drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding,
specifically for action recognition tasks using spike-based data.

*Jyun-Ze Tang,Chih-Fan Hsu,Jeng-Lin Li,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSSGen, a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in latent space using a lightweight upsampler, improving both efficiency and visual quality in text-to-image generation compared to traditional pixel-space scaling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods that downscale and upscale in pixel space during flow matching and diffusion model generation introduce artifacts and distortions when upscaled images are re-encoded into latent space, leading to degraded final image quality. There's a need for faster synthesis without compromising quality.

Method: Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen) framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler, without modifying the underlying Transformer or U-Net architecture, enabling flexible multi-resolution generation.

Result: LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches in comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality. When generating 1024² images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246% TOPIQ score improvement compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LSSGen successfully addresses the artifacts and quality degradation issues of traditional pixel-space scaling by operating directly in latent space, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and visual quality for text-to-image generation tasks.

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

### [66] [AMMNet: An Asymmetric Multi-Modal Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16158)
*Hui Ye,Haodong Chen,Zeke Zexi Hu,Xiaoming Chen,Yuk Ying Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMNet is a novel asymmetric multi-modal network that efficiently integrates RGB imagery and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data for semantic segmentation in remote sensing, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing computational complexity through asymmetric encoders and improved modality alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal semantic segmentation methods for remote sensing face two major limitations: increased computational complexity due to architectural redundancy when integrating RGB and DSM data, and degraded segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues particularly affect efficiency and robustness in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is essential.

Method: The paper proposes AMMNet with three key components: (1) Asymmetric Dual Encoder (ADE) that assigns different representational capacities based on modality characteristics - deeper encoder for RGB to capture rich contextual information and lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse structural features; (2) Asymmetric Prior Fuser (APF) that integrates modality-aware prior matrix to generate structure-aware contextual features; (3) Distribution Alignment (DA) module that enhances cross-modal compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence minimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that AMMNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among multi-modal networks while simultaneously reducing computational and memory requirements compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AMMNet successfully addresses the key challenges in multi-modal remote sensing segmentation by providing an asymmetric architecture that balances efficiency and accuracy. The proposed approach demonstrates that modality-specific design choices and improved alignment techniques can achieve superior performance with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for practical remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.

### [67] [AtrousMamaba: An Atrous-Window Scanning Visual State Space Model for Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16172)
*Tao Wang,Tiecheng Bai,Chao Xu,Bin Liu,Erlei Zhang,Jiyun Huang,Hongming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtrousMamba introduces an atrous-window selective scan mechanism to visual state space models (Mamba) that balances local detail extraction with global context integration, achieving superior performance on change detection tasks compared to CNN, Transformer, and existing Mamba-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual state space models (Mamba) focus on enhancing global receptive fields but overlook the importance of local information in dense prediction tasks. There's an open question whether Mamba can effectively extract local features like CNNs do, which is critical for tasks requiring fine-grained detail preservation.

Method: The paper proposes AtrousMamba with an atrous-window selective scan mechanism that gradually expands the scanning range with adjustable rates. This shortens distances between adjacent tokens and incorporates the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module. The authors design dedicated end-to-end frameworks AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD for binary and semantic change detection respectively.

Result: Experimental evaluation on six benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based methods for change detection tasks, showing superior performance across different architectural approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Mamba models can effectively capture both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local details in visual data when enhanced with the proposed atrous-window mechanism, successfully bridging the gap between global context modeling and local feature extraction in dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.

### [68] [Explicit Context Reasoning with Supervision for Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16191)
*Fansheng Zeng,Bineng Zhong,Haiying Xia,Yufei Tan,Xiantao Hu,Liangtao Shi,Shuxiang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSTrack proposes a visual tracking method that explicitly models contextual reasoning through three mechanisms: context reasoning, forward supervision, and efficient state modeling to improve temporal consistency and achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream tracking algorithms associate context by simply stacking historical information without explicit supervision, making it difficult to effectively model target's evolving dynamics and maintain temporal consistency in cross-frame modeling.

Method: RSTrack introduces three core mechanisms: 1) Context Reasoning Mechanism - constructs a target state reasoning pipeline that converts unconstrained contextual associations into temporal reasoning process; 2) Forward Supervision Strategy - uses true target features as anchors to constrain reasoning and guide predictions toward true target distribution; 3) Efficient State Modeling - employs compression-reconstruction to extract core target features and remove redundant information.

Result: RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds, effectively alleviating contextual association divergence issues in traditional temporal modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed RSTrack successfully addresses the problem of contextual association divergence in visual tracking by explicitly modeling and supervising context reasoning, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EBench-18K, a large-scale benchmark with 18K edited images and human preference annotations for evaluating text-guided image editing models, and proposes LMM4Edit, a comprehensive LMM-based evaluation metric that aligns well with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided image editing (TIE) models struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with original images. Existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations in scale and alignment with human perception, making it difficult to properly assess TIE model performance.

Method: The authors create EBench-18K, a comprehensive benchmark containing 1,080 source images with editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images from 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, and 55K+ human preference scores. They then develop LMM4Edit, a large multimodal model-based evaluation metric that assesses edited images across four dimensions: perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy.

Result: LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and demonstrates strong alignment with human preferences on the EBench-18K benchmark. The metric also shows good generalization ability when validated on other datasets in a zero-shot manner, indicating its broader applicability for evaluating text-guided image editing models.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the evaluation gap in text-guided image editing by providing both a comprehensive benchmark (EBench-18K) and an effective evaluation metric (LMM4Edit) that better aligns with human perception, enabling more reliable assessment of TIE model performance across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

### [70] [A Single-step Accurate Fingerprint Registration Method Based on Local Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16201)
*Yuwei Jia,Zhe Cui,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end single-step fingerprint registration algorithm that directly predicts semi-dense matching points between fingerprints, avoiding the limitations of traditional two-step methods that rely on minutiae detection and can fail with low-quality images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fingerprint registration methods use a two-step process (initial minutiae-based registration followed by dense registration) that frequently fails when fingerprint image quality is low because fewer minutiae are detected, leading to initial registration failure and overall process breakdown.

Method: An end-to-end single-step registration algorithm that directly predicts semi-dense matching point correspondences between two fingerprints using global-local attention mechanisms to achieve pixel-level alignment without relying on minutiae detection.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art matching performance with only single-step registration and can be combined with dense registration algorithms for further performance improvements, demonstrating superior robustness compared to traditional two-step approaches.

Conclusion: The single-step fingerprint registration approach successfully minimizes the risk of minutiae registration failure while maintaining high accuracy, offering a more robust solution for fingerprint alignment, especially in challenging low-quality image scenarios.

Abstract: Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.

Conclusion: MVP-LM successfully unifies diverse perception tasks within a single Visual Large Language Model framework, demonstrating versatility and effectiveness across multiple computer vision benchmarks through its multi-granular decoder and unified training strategy.

Abstract: Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and
instruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited
subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability
and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we
present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework
incorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to
integrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and
mask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative
multi-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset
unification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide
spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation,
detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDRFusion proposes a LiDAR-dominant two-stage framework for 3D object detection that first uses LiDAR alone for accurate proposals, then incorporates pseudo point clouds for challenging instances, achieving strong performance on KITTI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods suffer from noise introduced by pseudo point clouds constructed via depth completion, which can lead to inaccurate predictions despite addressing point cloud sparsity.

Method: A two-stage refinement framework where: (1) first stage uses LiDAR only to generate accurately localized proposals, (2) second stage incorporates pseudo point clouds to detect challenging instances, (3) results are merged at instance level, and (4) a hierarchical pseudo point residual encoding module enhances local structure representation using feature and positional residuals.

Result: The framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories and difficulty levels on the KITTI dataset, demonstrating effectiveness of the LiDAR-dominant approach.

Conclusion: LDRFusion successfully addresses the noise problem in LiDAR-Camera fusion by prioritizing reliable LiDAR data for initial proposals and strategically incorporating pseudo point clouds only when needed, resulting in improved 3D object detection performance.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D
object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as
auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate
detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual
encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and
positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our
framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories
and difficulty levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters cause devastating damage but effective response is hampered by difficulty accessing affected areas. Existing computer vision approaches for satellite imagery analysis are limited by narrow focus on specific disaster types, reliance on manual interpretation, and lack of datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations for tracking disaster progression.

Method: The authors created MONITRS, a novel multimodal dataset containing more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite imagery, natural language annotations from news articles, geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs.

Conclusion: The MONITRS dataset addresses key limitations in current disaster monitoring approaches by providing comprehensive multimodal data that enables better automated analysis of disaster events through improved machine learning models.

Abstract: Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure
every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite

*Xin Xu,Chaoyue Ren,Wei Liu,Wenke Huang,Bin Yang,Zhixi Yu,Kui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SSCU framework for federated domain generalization in person re-identification that screens positive styles and continuously utilizes them through dynamic memory and collaborative training to improve generalization performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods for person re-identification improve diversity through style transformation, but not all styles contribute positively to generalization performance. The paper aims to identify and continuously utilize beneficial (positive) styles while avoiding harmful (negative) styles.

Method: The proposed SSCU framework includes: 1) Generalization Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) to screen and accumulate positive styles for each client, 2) Style memory recognition loss to leverage memorized positive styles, and 3) Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy that trains client models on two branches using both newly generated and accumulated positive styles.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in both source domain and target domain performance for federated domain generalization in person re-identification.

Conclusion: The SSCU framework effectively addresses the challenge of style selection in federated domain generalization by screening positive styles and ensuring their continuous utilization, leading to improved generalization performance across different domains in person re-identification tasks.

Abstract: The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses text instruction neglect in unified image generation models like OmniGen by proposing Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), which dynamically scales attention activation for sub-instructions using cross-attention consistency between timesteps, improving instruction-following without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image generation models suffer from text instruction neglect, particularly when dealing with multiple sub-instructions, despite their advantages in handling diverse tasks within a single framework and eliminating the need for text encoders.

Method: The authors propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), which leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. They performed perturbation analysis and examined cross-attention maps to identify conflicts between neglected sub-instructions and input image activations.

Result: Experimental results on instruction-based image editing and visual conditional image generation demonstrate that SaaS achieves superior instruction-following fidelity compared to existing methods, without requiring additional training or test-time optimization.

Conclusion: SaaS effectively addresses the text instruction neglect problem in unified image generation models by dynamically scaling attention activations, enhancing instruction-following fidelity while maintaining the efficiency advantages of unified architectures.

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.

TL;DR: HoliTracer is the first framework designed to extract vectorized geographic objects from large-size remote sensing imagery, addressing the limitations of existing methods that process small patches and lose contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vector mapping from remote sensing imagery are constrained to processing small image patches, leading to loss of contextual information and fragmented vector outputs. There is a need for a holistic approach to handle large-size remote sensing imagery for high-precision vector mapping.

Method: The paper introduces HoliTracer framework with three key components: (1) Context Attention Net (CAN) that uses local-to-global attention mechanism for enhanced segmentation of large-size imagery, (2) Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) for polygon reconstruction, and (3) Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) for vertex tracing in a robust vectorization pipeline.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-size remote sensing imagery datasets including buildings, water bodies, and roads demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in vectorized geographic object extraction.

Conclusion: HoliTracer successfully addresses the limitations of existing patch-based methods by providing a holistic framework for vectorizing geographic objects from large-size remote sensing imagery, achieving superior performance across multiple object types.

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and

*Seunghyeon Kim,Kyeongryeol Go*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a data-centric approach to improve fisheye camera object detection by identifying model blind spots through error analysis and generating synthetic edge-case images to address specific failure modes like peripheral distortions and confusing class pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion that creates unique challenges for object detection models trained on conventional datasets, leading to poor performance in specialized fisheye imaging scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a systematic pipeline that: 1) conducts detailed error analysis to identify critical edge-cases (confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, underrepresented contexts), 2) fine-tunes an image generative model with carefully crafted prompts to synthesize images replicating real-world failure modes, and 3) pseudo-labels these synthetic images using a high-quality detector before integrating them into training.

Result: The approach achieves consistent performance gains in fisheye object detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted synthetic data generation for addressing specific model weaknesses.

Conclusion: Understanding data characteristics and selectively addressing weaknesses through edge-case synthesis can significantly improve model performance in specialized domains like fisheye object detection, highlighting the value of data-centric approaches over purely algorithmic solutions.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges
to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its

### [78] [Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257)
*Futa Waseda,Saku Sugawara,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes QT-AFT (Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning) to improve adversarial robustness of vision-language models like CLIP by using high-quality captions during training, achieving better zero-shot adversarial robustness than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods for vision-language models have limitations: supervised methods overfit to training object classes due to short text labels, while unsupervised methods lack semantic guidance against text-guided attacks. There's a need to better leverage language information to enhance visual robustness in VLMs.

Method: QT-AFT (Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning) uses high-quality captions during adversarial training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse image semantics. This approach enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize broader image features under adversarial noise by incorporating rich linguistic supervision.

Result: QT-AFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy across 16 zero-shot datasets. The method successfully overcomes overfitting issues in supervised adversarial training and semantic awareness problems in unsupervised approaches. Additionally, describing object properties beyond names further enhances robustness.

Conclusion: High-quality linguistic supervision is crucial for robust visual representation learning. The study reveals that language plays a vital role in enhancing vision robustness, and future work should focus on centering quality linguistic supervision in robust visual learning frameworks.

Abstract: Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.

### [79] [ToFe: Lagged Token Freezing and Reusing for Efficient Vision Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16260)
*Haoyue Zhang,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToFe introduces a novel token freezing and reusing framework for vision transformers that temporarily freezes unimportant tokens and reuses them later, achieving 50% computational cost reduction with less than 2% accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers suffer from computationally expensive self-attention that hinders deployment on resource-constrained devices. Existing token reduction methods irreversibly discard tokens, preventing their reuse despite transformers focusing on different information across blocks, where early-discarded tokens might be useful later.

Method: The ToFe framework identifies important tokens at each stage and temporarily freezes unimportant ones for later reuse. It includes a prediction module for token identification and an approximate module for frozen token recovery, with joint optimization through computation budget-aware end-to-end training.

Result: ToFe reduces LV-ViT model computational cost by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, demonstrating superior performance-complexity trade-off compared to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ToFe successfully addresses the efficiency challenges of vision transformers by enabling adaptive token processing that maintains performance while significantly reducing computational overhead, making it suitable for resource-constrained device deployment.

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

### [80] [MAN++: Scaling Momentum Auxiliary Network for Supervised Local Learning in Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16279)
*Junhao Su,Feiyu Zhu,Hengyu Shi,Tianyang Han,Yurui Qiu,Junfeng Luo,Xiaoming Wei,Jialin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAN++ (Momentum Auxiliary Network++), a supervised local learning method that uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and learnable scaling bias to enable communication between network blocks, achieving performance comparable to end-to-end backpropagation while reducing GPU memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional end-to-end backpropagation suffers from update locking, high GPU memory consumption, and lack of biological plausibility. Existing supervised local learning methods partition networks into blocks but experience performance degradation due to limited inter-block information flow, preventing them from replacing end-to-end training.

Method: MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent blocks to facilitate inter-block communication. The method includes an auxiliary network updated via EMA and incorporates a learnable scaling bias to address feature discrepancies between local blocks and balance feature differences.

Result: Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and image segmentation across multiple network architectures demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: MAN++ successfully addresses the limitations of supervised local learning by enabling effective inter-block communication, offering a viable alternative to conventional end-to-end training methods that maintains performance while providing memory efficiency benefits.

Abstract: Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.

### [81] [Beyond Label Semantics: Language-Guided Action Anatomy for Few-shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16287)
*Zefeng Qian,Xincheng Yao,Yifei Huang,Chongyang Zhang,Jiangyong Ying,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a framework that uses Large Language Models to break down action labels into atomic components (subject, motion, object) and combines this with visual anatomy to improve few-shot action recognition in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot action recognition faces challenges due to scarcity of training data. While recent work incorporates text modalities, action labels alone cannot fully capture the subtle variations in human posture, motion dynamics, and object interactions that are critical for understanding actions across different phases.

Method: The framework uses LLMs to decompose action labels into atomic action descriptions focusing on subject, motion, and object. A Visual Anatomy Module segments videos into atomic phases. Features are fused at the atomic level between text and video, and a Multimodal Matching mechanism performs both video-video and video-text matching for classification.

Result: LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple few-shot action recognition benchmarks, demonstrating improved generalization through the atomic-level decomposition and multimodal fusion approach.

Conclusion: By leveraging LLMs to anatomize action labels into atomic components and combining this with visual segmentation, the proposed LGA framework effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues and creates more generalizable prototypes for few-shot action recognition.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dens3R is a 3D foundation model that jointly predicts multiple geometric quantities (depth, surface normals, point maps) from images using a unified framework that ensures geometric consistency across single-view and multi-view inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods predict single geometry quantities in isolation, failing to ensure consistency between inherently correlated geometric properties like depth, surface normals, and point maps, which limits accuracy and practical applicability.

Method: A two-stage training framework with a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone, position-interpolated rotary positional encoding for high-resolution robustness, and integration of image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling to jointly regress multiple geometric quantities.

Result: Dens3R demonstrates superior performance across various dense 3D prediction tasks, achieving accurate and consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs with a post-processing pipeline supporting geometrically consistent multi-view inference.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses the limitation of isolated geometric quantity prediction by explicitly modeling structural coupling among different geometric properties, resulting in improved accuracy and consistency for dense 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.

*Yanchen Liu,Yanan Sun,Zhening Xing,Junyao Gao,Kai Chen,Wenjie Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionShot is a training-free framework that enables smooth motion transfer between objects with significant appearance or structural differences by using semantic feature matching and morphological alignment techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a reference object to a target object when there are significant differences in appearance or structure between them, creating a need for better motion transfer capabilities.

Method: MotionShot uses a two-stage approach: (1) semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between reference and target objects, and (2) reference-to-target shape retargeting to establish low-level morphological alignments. Motion is encoded using temporal attention to enable coherent transfer across disparate objects.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across objects even when there are significant appearance and structure disparities, achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while preserving appearance coherence.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of motion transfer between structurally different objects through a training-free framework that combines semantic and morphological alignment techniques, enabling high-quality motion transfer in text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces M-SpecGene, the first generalized RGBT multispectral foundation model that learns modality-invariant representations through self-supervised learning, addressing limitations of task-specific approaches through a novel Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity metric and progressive masking strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RGBT (RGB-Thermal) vision tasks follow case-by-case research paradigms with manually customized models, which are constrained by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck issues. There's a need for a unified approach that can generalize across multiple RGBT tasks.

Method: The authors develop M-SpecGene, a foundation model using self-supervised learning on large-scale data. They introduce Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify information density across RGB and thermal modalities, and implement GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy for flexible, easy-to-hard, object-centric pre-training.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets covering four different RGBT downstream tasks, showing the effectiveness of the unified foundation model approach compared to task-specific methods.

Conclusion: M-SpecGene successfully addresses the limitations of case-by-case RGBT research by providing a unified foundation model that learns modality-invariant representations, offering new insights into multispectral fusion and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across multiple RGBT tasks.

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates Scene Text Detection and Recognition (STDR) performance using Meta's Project Aria smart glasses in real-world conditions, finding that resolution and distance significantly impact accuracy while image upscaling reduces error rates from 0.65 to 0.48 CER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of wearable technology and egocentric vision applications, there is a need to understand how environmental factors affect STDR algorithms in real-world scenarios for potential AR and assistive applications like asset inspection and nutrition analysis.

Method: The researchers created a custom dataset using Meta's Project Aria smart glasses under controlled conditions and evaluated two OCR pipelines (EAST with CRNN, and EAST with PyTesseract) while analyzing the impact of environmental variables including lighting, distance, and resolution. They also explored image upscaling as a preprocessing technique and investigated eye-gaze tracking integration.

Result: Resolution and distance significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting has a less predictable impact. Image upscaling proved to be an effective preprocessing technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. Eye-gaze tracking shows potential for optimizing processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones.

Conclusion: The study successfully benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions and establishes groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. The findings provide insights for developing robust, context-sensitive text recognition systems for assistive and research applications.

Abstract: In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text
Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and

significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less

demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise

*Xinyu Mao,Xiaohan Xing,Fei Meng,Jianbang Liu,Fan Bai,Qiang Nie,Max Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OP-SAM is a one-shot polyp segmentation framework that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image using SAM, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring extensive manual annotations or prompt inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional polyp segmentation methods struggle with morphological variability and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining and large-scale annotations. While SAM shows promise for medical segmentation, its prompt-dependent nature limits automation since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: The paper proposes OP-SAM with three key components: (1) Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer from a single annotated image, (2) Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to handle polyp size variations and filter noisy transfers, and (3) Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement to progressively enhance segmentation quality.

Result: Extensive evaluations across five datasets demonstrate OP-SAM's effectiveness. On the Kvasir dataset, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%. The method successfully provides accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens.

Conclusion: OP-SAM successfully addresses the automation limitation of SAM in medical applications by automatically generating prompts from a single annotated image, achieving superior performance in polyp segmentation while maintaining generalizability and reducing annotation requirements.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by

*Mingtao Guo,Guanyu Xing,Yanci Zhang,Yanli Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRVD is a novel face reenactment framework that uses video diffusion models to generate high-quality talking head videos with large pose variations by combining implicit keypoint extraction, motion alignment, and a warping feature mapper that leverages pretrained video priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face reenactment methods struggle with large pose variations due to warping artifacts when using implicit keypoints or limitations when relying on coarse facial landmarks, creating a need for better handling of extreme pose changes while preserving identity and motion quality.

Method: The method employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial keypoints from source and driving images, performs motion alignment through warping, and introduces a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) that maps warped source images into the motion-aware latent space of a pretrained image-to-video model to correct warping degradation and enhance temporal coherence.

Result: FRVD achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios with extreme pose variations, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by leveraging pretrained video diffusion models and warping feature mapping, enabling high-fidelity face reenactment even under large pose changes while maintaining identity preservation and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that

Conclusion: Mamba-OTR provides a strong baseline for online take and release detection by effectively combining the Mamba architecture with specialized training techniques, demonstrating that it can achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world online applications.

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LPTR-AFLNet, a lightweight unified network that combines perspective transformation correction and Chinese license plate recognition in an end-to-end manner, achieving high accuracy and real-time performance (under 10ms) on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces challenges in unconstrained environments due to perspective distortions from various shooting angles and the need to handle both single-line and double-line license plates. Edge devices have limited computational resources, requiring low-complexity solutions for real-time deployment.

Method: The authors develop LPTR-AFLNet, which integrates a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized recognition network AFLNet. The system uses recognition output as weak supervisory signals to guide correction. Key improvements include an enhanced attention module to reduce character confusion and Focal Loss to address class imbalance during training.

Result: LPTR-AFLNet demonstrates exceptional performance in correcting perspective distortion and recognizing double-line license plates across challenging scenarios. The method achieves high recognition accuracy while running in less than 10 milliseconds on lower-mid-range GPU platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed LPTR-AFLNet successfully addresses the dual challenges of perspective correction and license plate recognition in a unified, lightweight framework, making it practical for real-time deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.

*Kuo-Cheng Wu,Guohang Zhuang,Jinyang Huang,Xiang Zhang,Wanli Ouyang,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAR, a large-scale astronomical super-resolution dataset with 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs, and proposes FISR model that outperforms existing methods by 24.84% on flux consistency metrics for astronomical imaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing astronomical super-resolution datasets have three critical limitations: flux inconsistency, object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, which significantly impede the development of astronomical super-resolution methods needed for detecting faraway celestial objects and precise structural analysis.

Method: The authors create STAR dataset using Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution observations paired with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated through a flux-preserving pipeline. They introduce a novel Flux Error (FE) metric for evaluation and propose the Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR) model that accurately infers flux-consistent high-resolution images from input photometry.

Result: The FISR model suppresses several state-of-the-art super-resolution methods by 24.84% on the novel flux consistency metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and validate the value of the STAR dataset for astronomical super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The STAR dataset and FISR model successfully address the limitations of existing astronomical super-resolution approaches by providing flux-consistent, diverse training data and a model specifically designed for astrophysical applications, showing significant improvements in flux consistency preservation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial
objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for
astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset
containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide
celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)
model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images
from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by
24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our
method for astrophysics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method and the value of our dataset. Code and models are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biologically-informed approach for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain fMRI data using sphere tokenization, structural MRI integration, and positive-sample mixup to improve accuracy and interpretability while accounting for individual anatomical variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fMRI-to-visual reconstruction methods overlook critical brain structure-function relationships by flattening spatial information and neglecting individual anatomical variations, which limits their biological interpretability and reconstruction accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces three key innovations: (1) a sphere tokenizer that models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D spherical data on the cortical surface, (2) integration of structural MRI data to enable personalized encoding of individual anatomical variations, and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging multiple fMRI scans of the same visual stimulus.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing enhanced reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability, and generalizability across individuals.

Conclusion: The biologically-informed approach effectively bridges neuroscience and computer vision by preserving spatial brain structure information and accounting for individual differences, leading to better visual stimulus reconstruction from fMRI data with improved interpretability.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity (e.g., fMRI) bridges
neuroscience and computer vision by decoding neural representations. However,
existing methods often overlook critical brain structure-function
relationships, flattening spatial information and neglecting individual
anatomical variations. To address these issues, we propose (1) a novel sphere
tokenizer that explicitly models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D
spherical data on the cortical surface; (2) integration of structural MRI
(sMRI) data, enabling personalized encoding of individual anatomical
variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,
and generalizability across individuals. Experiments demonstrate superior
reconstruction performance compared to SOTA methods, highlighting the
effectiveness and interpretability of our biologically informed approach.

### [92] [Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393)
*Lazaro Janier Gonzalez-Sole,Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot presentation attack detection (PAD) framework for face recognition systems using foundation models, which can detect unknown attack types without requiring training data containing those specific attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks that are easy to create and execute. Current deep learning PAD approaches require large amounts of training data and lack generalizability to unknown presentation attack instruments (PAI) or databases not seen during training.

Method: The authors assess foundation models' effectiveness in established and challenging experimental scenarios, then propose a simple but effective zero-shot PAD framework that leverages these pre-trained foundation models without requiring attack-specific training data.

Result: Foundation models achieve competitive performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort compared to advanced PAD mechanisms trained on attack data. The top-performing foundation model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods using the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database containing challenging 2D and 3D attacks.

Conclusion: Foundation models demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities for presentation attack detection, offering better generalizability than traditional PAD approaches and achieving superior performance on challenging unknown attack scenarios without requiring attack-specific training data.

Abstract: Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks

*Kahim Wong,Jicheng Zhou,Haiwei Wu,Yain-Whar Si,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADCD-Net is a robust document forgery detection model that adaptively uses RGB/DCT forensic traces and integrates document-specific characteristics to achieve superior localization performance, outperforming existing methods by 20.79% across various distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detectors for natural images struggle with document images because tampered regions can be seamlessly blended into uniform document backgrounds and structured text. Document-specific methods also lack sufficient robustness against various degradations, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: ADCD-Net adaptively modulates DCT feature contribution based on predicted alignment scores to handle block misalignment sensitivity. It uses hierarchical content disentanglement to address text-background disparities and constructs pristine prototypes capturing traces of untampered regions to enhance both accuracy and robustness.

Result: ADCD-Net demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79% averaged over 5 types of distortions including resizing and cropping.

Conclusion: The proposed ADCD-Net successfully addresses the challenges of document image forgery detection by adaptively leveraging forensic traces and document-specific characteristics, achieving robust performance across various distortions and significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.

*Tanveer Younis,Zhanglin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey reviews recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction methods, comparing neural implicit models (NeRF variants), explicit point-cloud approaches (3D Gaussian Splatting), and hybrid frameworks using diffusion and vision foundation models to address challenges when minimal image overlap prevents traditional SfM/MVS methods from working.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods like structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS) fail in sparse-view scenarios with minimal image overlap, which are common in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems where dense image acquisition is impractical.

Method: The paper surveys three main approaches: (1) neural implicit models like NeRF and regularized versions, (2) explicit point-cloud-based methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting, and (3) hybrid frameworks leveraging priors from diffusion and vision foundation models. The analysis focuses on geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference techniques.

Result: Comparative analysis on standard benchmarks reveals key trade-offs between reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across different methods. The survey identifies how different approaches mitigate artifacts like floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.

Conclusion: The survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative methods for sparse-view reconstruction. Persistent challenges remain in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction, with future directions pointing toward developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The railway sector lacks publicly available real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new perception solutions for automatic train operations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate promising performance of the synthetic dataset and domain adaptation approach. The evaluation shows the effectiveness of using synthetic datasets combined with domain adaptation techniques for railway perception tasks, successfully transferring knowledge from synthetic to real railway environments.

Conclusion: SynDRA-BBox represents a significant contribution as the first synthetic dataset tailored for railway object detection, effectively addressing the data scarcity problem in the railway domain. The successful adaptation of automotive domain adaptation methods to railway contexts demonstrates the potential of synthetic datasets and cross-domain techniques in advancing perception capabilities for railway environments.

Abstract: In recent years, interest in automatic train operations has significantly
increased. To enable advanced functionalities, robust vision-based algorithms
are essential for perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment.
However, the railway sector suffers from a lack of publicly available
real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new

*Georg Siedel,Ekagra Gupta,Weijia Shao,Silvia Vock,Andrey Morozov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper extends adaptive label smoothing (soft augmentation) beyond random-crop to other augmentation types like random erasing and noise injection, but finds it only works well with limited, homogeneous transformations and can harm robustness when used with diverse augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the soft augmentation framework, which adaptively reduces label confidence based on augmentation intensity, from random-crop to other aggressive augmentation techniques to improve supervised learning regularization for image classifiers.

Method: The method extends adaptive label smoothing to random erasing and noise injection augmentations, where label confidence is reduced based on the magnitude/intensity of the applied augmentation transformations during training.

Result: Adaptive label smoothing enables stronger regularization with higher-intensity Random Erasing augmentation. However, the benefits disappear when applied with diverse augmentation methods like TrivialAugment, and excessive label smoothing reduces robustness to common image corruptions.

Conclusion: Adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when training data distribution is dominated by limited and homogeneous image transformation types, as it fails to provide benefits and may harm performance when used with diverse augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation that uses prototype-based contrastive consistency to improve robustness against noisy pseudo-labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on EndoScapes2023 and newly introduced MOSXAV datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level medical image annotations are expensive and time-consuming, requiring expert collaboration. Existing semi-supervised methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels that disrupt semantic distributions in latent space, limiting their effectiveness in leveraging abundant unlabeled data alongside limited annotated data.

Method: A diffusion-based framework that introduces constraints into the latent structure of semantic labels during denoising diffusion by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. The method uses class prototypes as centralized semantic anchors in latent space rather than explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, improving robustness against noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under semi-supervised learning settings on both EndoScapes2023 and the newly introduced MOSXAV benchmark. The approach demonstrates enhanced robustness for dense predictions, particularly when dealing with noisy pseudo-labels.

Conclusion: The work presents a robust and data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong potential for clinical applications. The introduction of the MOSXAV benchmark provides a valuable resource for the medical imaging community, and the prototype-based contrastive consistency approach successfully addresses the challenges of semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C2-Evo is a closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities for multimodal large language models, addressing data complexity mismatches and model-task difficulty misalignment through cross-modal data evolution and adaptive model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs require high-quality vision-language datasets that are costly to scale, and current self-improving methods suffer from: (1) separate augmentation of visual/textual data causing complexity discrepancies, and (2) separated evolution of data and models leading to mismatched difficulty levels between models and tasks.

Method: C2-Evo employs two interconnected loops: (1) a cross-modal data evolution loop that generates complex multimodal problems combining structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, and (2) a data-model evolution loop that adaptively selects generated problems based on model performance and conducts alternating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The method continuously refines both model and training data, achieving considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks through the joint evolution approach.

Conclusion: C2-Evo successfully addresses the core challenges in MLLM self-improvement by jointly evolving data and model capabilities through automatic closed-loop optimization, demonstrating effective enhancement of multimodal reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.

### [101] [DenseSR: Image Shadow Removal as Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16472)
*Yu-Fan Lin,Chia-Ming Lee,Chih-Chung Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseSR is a novel framework for single-image shadow removal that uses dense prediction approach with geometric-semantic priors and a Dense Fusion Block to achieve high-quality restoration while maintaining both intra-shadow details and sharp boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional shadow removal methods fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details and maintain sharp boundaries due to non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity in challenging indirect illumination scenarios, resulting in inconsistent restoration and blurring that negatively affect downstream applications and viewing experience.

Method: The DenseSR framework employs two key strategies: (1) deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder that includes an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for fine textures and sharp boundaries.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DenseSR outperforms existing methods in shadow removal quality, successfully addressing the inconsistent restoration and blurring issues while preserving both consistency and fidelity in the restored images.

Conclusion: The proposed DenseSR framework effectively tackles the challenging problem of single-image shadow removal by leveraging dense prediction perspective with geometric-semantic guidance and adaptive component processing, achieving superior restoration quality compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework for cancer survival prediction from pathology images that uses dynamic patch selection, graph-guided clustering, attention mechanisms, and mixture density modeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance on renal cancer and lung adenocarcinoma datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cancer-specific survival prediction from whole slide pathology images by addressing challenges of large image sizes, tissue heterogeneity, and complex survival distributions while achieving better accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Method: A four-component modular framework: (1) dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding to identify prognostically informative regions, (2) graph-guided k-means clustering for capturing phenotype-level heterogeneity, (3) attention mechanisms modeling intra- and inter-cluster relationships for contextualizing features, and (4) expert-guided mixture density modeling using Gaussian mixture models for survival distribution estimation.

Result: Achieved concordance index of 0.712±0.028 and Brier score of 0.254±0.018 on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and concordance index of 0.645±0.017 and Brier score of 0.281±0.031 on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework demonstrates superior predictive performance for cancer survival prediction across diverse cancer types, significantly improving upon existing state-of-the-art accuracy through its comprehensive approach to handling WSI complexity and survival modeling.

Abstract: We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from
whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than
the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method
across diverse cancer types.

TL;DR: PlantSAM combines YOLOv10 and SAM2 to automatically segment plant regions in herbarium images, removing background noise to improve classification accuracy by up to 4.36% across botanical traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning classification of herbarium images suffers from background heterogeneity that introduces noise and artifacts, misleading models and reducing classification accuracy. Addressing these background-related challenges is critical for improving model performance.

Method: An automated segmentation pipeline called PlantSAM that integrates YOLOv10 for plant region detection and Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for segmentation.

When incorporated into classification models, it led to consistent performance improvements across five botanical traits, with accuracy gains up to 4.36% and F1-score improvements of 4.15%.

Conclusion: Background removal in herbarium image analysis significantly enhances classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on foreground plant structures. The proposed PlantSAM pipeline demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of automated segmentation for improving botanical classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based classification of herbarium images is hampered by

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zebra-CoT, a large-scale dataset of 182,384 samples for training multimodal models to use visual aids in reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements on visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training multimodal models for Visual Chain of Thought reasoning is challenging due to poor off-the-shelf performance that hinders reinforcement learning and lack of high-quality visual CoT training data.

Method: Created Zebra-CoT dataset with 182,384 diverse samples containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces across four task categories: scientific questions, 2D visual reasoning, 3D reasoning, and visual logic problems. Fine-tuned Anole-7B and Bagel-7B models on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning Anole-7B on Zebra-CoT achieved +12% improvement in test-set accuracy and up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmarks. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B produced high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains.

Conclusion: Zebra-CoT effectively develops multimodal reasoning abilities in models, demonstrating the value of large-scale, diverse visual CoT training data for improving visual reasoning performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

*Xiaoyan Wang,Zeju Li,Yifan Xu,Jiaxing Qi,Zhifei Yang,Ruifei Ma,Xiangde Liu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Spatial 3D-LLM, a multimodal large language model that enhances spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks through progressive spatial awareness scheme and location-enriched 3D scene embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D multimodal LLMs have limited spatial awareness because they rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects, which provides insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes for vision-language tasks.

Method: The authors develop Spatial 3D-LLM by integrating an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.

Result: Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks. The authors also introduce two novel tasks (3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing) and construct a 3D instruction dataset called MODEL to evaluate spatial awareness capabilities.

Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrate that the progressive spatial awareness scheme successfully mines more profound spatial information, leading to improved performance on 3D vision-language tasks and enhanced spatial awareness capabilities in multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

*Shang Liu,Chenjie Cao,Chaohui Yu,Wen Qian,Jing Wang,Fan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EarthCrafter, a framework for generating large-scale 3D Earth terrain using a new massive aerial dataset (Aerial-Earth3D) and a dual sparse 3D-VAE architecture that separates geometric and textural generation via latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods cannot scale to geographic extents like modeling thousands of square kilometers of Earth's surface, creating a need for specialized approaches that can handle vast geographic scales while maintaining quality and detail.

Method: The approach combines two key innovations: (1) Aerial-Earth3D dataset with 50k curated 600m×600m scenes from U.S. mainland containing 45M multi-view Google Earth frames with comprehensive annotations, and (2) EarthCrafter framework using dual sparse 3D-VAEs to compress geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats into compact latent spaces, plus condition-aware flow matching models for flexible geometry and texture generation.

Result: EarthCrafter demonstrates substantially better performance in extremely large-scale 3D generation compared to existing methods. The framework successfully supports diverse applications including semantic-guided urban layout generation and unconditional terrain synthesis while maintaining geographic plausibility.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of large-scale 3D Earth generation through the combination of a comprehensive aerial dataset and an innovative dual-sparse architecture that separates structural and textural generation, enabling versatile geographic-scale 3D modeling applications.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

*Jon Gutiérrez-Zaballa,Koldo Basterretxea,Javier Echanobe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents optimization techniques for deploying DNN-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation on FPGA-based SoCs for autonomous driving systems, achieving significant model compression and speed improvements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical autonomous driving systems require real-time HSI processing with strict constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security. Traditional HSI systems face computational challenges due to over-parameterized DNNs and intensive data preprocessing requirements, necessitating efficient edge deployment solutions.

Method: The authors employ a comprehensive software/hardware co-design approach including: functional task distribution between software and hardware, hardware-aware preprocessing optimization, ML model compression techniques, and complete pipelined deployment on FPGA-based SoC platforms.

Result: The optimization techniques achieved dramatic model compression - reducing computational complexity to 24.34% of original operations and parameters to 1.02% of the original count. This resulted in a 2.86x speed-up in inference performance while maintaining segmentation accuracy without noticeable degradation.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that through careful software/hardware co-design and model compression, HSI-based DNN segmentation can be efficiently deployed on edge platforms for autonomous driving applications, meeting real-time performance requirements while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.

Conclusion: The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery and offers a high-quality resource to support future research in surgical scene understanding.

Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the

*Wenbo Xu,Junyan Wu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MDP, a multimodal framework for detecting temporal deepfake segments in videos using only video-level labels, combining visual and audio features through cross-modal attention to identify forged portions without requiring precise temporal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods are restrictive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale for large datasets when treating detection as classification or requiring fully-supervised temporal localization with precise annotations.

Method: The MDP framework uses: (1) a multimodal interaction mechanism with temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure visual-audio relevance in probabilistic embedding space, and (2) an extensible deviation perceiving loss that enlarges deviation between adjacent segments in forged samples while reducing it in genuine samples.

Result: The proposed framework achieves comparable performance to fully-supervised approaches across several evaluation metrics while requiring only weak video-level supervision instead of precise temporal annotations.

Conclusion: The MDP framework effectively addresses scalability issues in deepfake detection by enabling weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization through multimodal deviation perception, making it more practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

*Xueming Fu,Pei Wu,Yingtai Li,Xin Luo,Zihang Jiang,Junhao Mei,Jian Lu,Gao-Jun Teng,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dyna3DGR, a novel framework combining 3D Gaussian representation with neural motion fields for accurate cardiac motion tracking in 4D CMR imaging, achieving superior performance compared to existing deep learning registration methods without requiring extensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardiac motion analysis is crucial for evaluating cardiac function, but existing approaches have significant limitations: image-based methods struggle with topological consistency or require extensive training data, while representation-based methods lose image-level details. The homogeneous nature of myocardial tissue and lack of distinctive features make fine-grained 4D cardiac motion tracking particularly challenging.

Method: The paper introduces Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation (Dyna3DGR), which combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation with implicit neural motion field modeling. The method uses differentiable volumetric rendering to bridge continuous motion representation with image-space alignment, simultaneously optimizing cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner without requiring extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC dataset show that Dyna3DGR surpasses state-of-the-art deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy while preserving both topological and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Dyna3DGR successfully addresses the limitations of existing cardiac motion tracking approaches by combining the advantages of both image-based and representation-based methods, achieving superior tracking accuracy without the drawbacks of requiring extensive training data or losing image-level details.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The
code will be available in https://github.com/windrise/Dyna3DGR.

### [111] [CTSL: Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning for Accurate Non-Contrast Cardiac Risk Prediction Using Cine MRIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16612)
*Haoyang Su,Shaohao Rui,Jinyi Xiang,Lianming Wu,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents CTSL, a self-supervised framework that predicts Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) from contrast-free Cine MRI sequences without requiring manual segmentation masks, using codebook-based temporal-spatial learning to capture motion patterns and achieve superior performance compared to traditional contrast-dependent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MACE prediction methods require supervised learning with human-refined masks in ventricular myocardium and contrast agents, which becomes impractical in contrast-free scenarios. There is a need for accurate, non-invasive cardiac risk assessment that doesn't rely on contrast agents or manual segmentation.

Method: The paper introduces Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial Learning (CTSL), a self-supervised framework that decouples temporal and spatial features through multi-view distillation. The teacher model processes multiple Cine views while the student model learns from reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. The method uses codebook-based feature representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues to capture temporal dependencies and motion patterns.

Result: CTSL achieves high-confidence MACE risk predictions and outperforms traditional contrast-dependent methods. The framework provides a rapid, non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment from raw Cine MRI data without requiring segmentation masks.

Conclusion: The proposed CTSL framework enables timely and accessible heart disease diagnosis in clinical settings by providing accurate MACE prediction from contrast-free Cine MRI sequences, eliminating the need for contrast agents and manual segmentation while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction
from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.

TL;DR: ASaRG extends LLaVA architecture by integrating radiological segmentation maps and intermediate features to improve automated medical report generation, achieving significant performance gains while providing better grounding and traceability for clinical assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable end-to-end clinical report generation to alleviate radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians, requiring models with strong general performance and grounding capabilities to convince users of report veracity.

Method: ASaRG fuses intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps from specialist radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple concatenation, adding only a small number of parameters to the existing architecture.

Result: Achieved +0.89% CE F1 score improvement (p=0.012) using only intermediate features and +2.77% improvement (p<0.001) with combined features and segmentation maps compared to LLaVA baseline. Outperformed COMG and ORID by 6.98% and 6.28% F1 score respectively.

Conclusion: ASaRG successfully enhances medical report generation performance while providing grounding capabilities through segmentation map traceability. The method is compatible with other LLaVA architecture modifications and demonstrates the value of incorporating specialist radiological model outputs for improved clinical report generation.

Abstract: Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.

*Meng Lou,Yunxiang Fu,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A2Mamba proposes a novel Transformer-Mamba hybrid architecture with Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS) that deeply integrates attention mechanisms with SSMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across visual recognition tasks including ImageNet classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that combine Transformers and Mamba for visual recognition simply stack layers without interaction mechanisms, limiting their potential. Deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an open problem that needs to be addressed to capture both local details and global contexts more effectively.

Method: The paper introduces A2Mamba, a hybrid network featuring Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS). The key innovation is A2SSM, which performs cross-attention by spatially aggregating SSM's hidden states using multi-scale attention maps, enhancing spatial dependencies in 2D space while improving dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs.

Result: A2Mamba achieves superior performance across multiple tasks: A2Mamba-L reaches 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% mIoU in semantic segmentation with higher efficiency, and A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in object detection/instance segmentation while using 40% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: A2Mamba successfully addresses the limitation of simple stacking in existing Transformer-Mamba hybrids by introducing deep integration through attention-augmented SSMs. The proposed architecture outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based methods in visual recognition tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the deep integration approach.

Abstract: Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

### [114] [Benchmarking pig detection and tracking under diverse and challenging conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16639)
*Jonathan Henrich,Christian Post,Maximilian Zilke,Parth Shiroya,Emma Chanut,Amir Mollazadeh Yamchi,Ramin Yahyapour,Thomas Kneib,Imke Traulsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic benchmarking study for pig detection and tracking in barn environments, introducing two datasets (PigDetect and PigTrack) and comparing various machine learning approaches for automated animal monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual monitoring of individual pig behavior is labor-intensive and inefficient. While machine learning advances enable automated monitoring, there lacks a systematic benchmarking study for pig detection and tracking methods, creating a gap in understanding which approaches work best in realistic barn conditions.

Method: The authors curated two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking, using diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions with challenging scenarios. They compared state-of-the-art detection models against real-time alternatives, and evaluated SORT-based methods versus end-to-end trainable models for tracking.

Result: For object detection, challenging training images improved performance beyond random sampling, and state-of-the-art models significantly outperformed real-time alternatives. For tracking, SORT-based methods achieved superior detection performance while end-to-end models showed better association performance. Models demonstrated good generalization to unseen pens.

Conclusion: The study establishes benchmark datasets and demonstrates that high-quality training data is crucial for good generalization. State-of-the-art detection models are superior for accuracy while end-to-end tracking models show promise for future development. The publicly available datasets and code will facilitate further research in automated pig monitoring.

Abstract: To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.

*Shuang Song,Yang Tang,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for building segmentation in remote sensing that re-trains models at test time using synthetic data tailored to target regions, generating geo-typical synthetic images from geospatial data to improve model generalization across diverse geographic areas without requiring extensive real-world annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for building segmentation struggle to generalize across diverse geographic regions due to variations in city layouts, building types, sizes, and locations. The time-consuming process of creating annotated data for worldwide diversity cannot keep pace with increasingly data-hungry models, creating a need for alternative approaches to improve generalization.

Method: Re-training models at test time using synthetic data tailored to target regions. The approach leverages geospatial data (street networks from OpenStreetMap) to generate geo-typical synthetic data that replicates urban structure. It uses procedural modeling and physics-based rendering to create high-resolution synthetic images with domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and environmental illumination. The method integrates geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework to overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. The method successfully generates virtually unlimited training samples while maintaining essential characteristics of target environments and provides a scalable, cost-effective solution.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical pathway to improving generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive real-world annotations. It provides a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue in purely synthetic datasets by blending partial geographic knowledge with synthetic imagery, enabling scalable and cost-effective improvements in model performance across diverse geographic regions.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote
sensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic
regions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building
types, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated
data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of
increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.

### [116] [QRetinex-Net: Quaternion-Valued Retinex Decomposition for Low-Level Computer Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16683)
*Sos Agaian,Vladimir Frants*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quaternion Retinex, a novel image enhancement method that uses quaternion mathematics to decompose low-light images into reflectance and illumination components, addressing key limitations of traditional Retinex models and achieving 2-11% performance improvements in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light images suffer from color shift, low contrast, and noise that hurt computer vision accuracy. Existing Retinex models have four major flaws: they treat RGB channels independently, lack neuroscientific color vision modeling, cannot perfectly reconstruct input images, and don't explain human color constancy.

Method: The authors propose the first Quaternion Retinex formulation where the scene is represented as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and illumination components. They also introduce the Reflectance Consistency Index to measure how well reflectance remains invariant across different lighting conditions.

Result: Testing on low-light crack inspection, face detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion shows 2-11% performance gains over leading methods. The approach demonstrates better color fidelity, lower noise, and higher reflectance stability compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: Quaternion Retinex successfully addresses the limitations of traditional Retinex models by using quaternion mathematics to better model color relationships, resulting in improved low-light image enhancement with superior color preservation and stability for computer vision applications.

Abstract: Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.

*Yiguo He,Junjie Zhu,Yiying Li,Xiaoyu Zhang,Chunping Qiu,Jun Wang,Qiangjuan Huang,Ke Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MpGI, a two-stage method for generating high-quality captions for remote sensing images, creating the HQRS-IT-210K dataset with 210K images and 1.3M captions, and demonstrating superior performance with HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models using significantly less training data than previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge in applying Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) to remote sensing imagery is the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale image-text paired training data. Existing datasets suffer from suboptimal quality due to rudimentary caption generation methods, requiring larger volumes of training data while only yielding modest performance improvements.

Method: The paper proposes MpGI (Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration), a two-stage method: (1) Generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods, (2) Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions that capture details from multiple perspectives. This creates the HQRS-IT-210K dataset with ~210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions.

Result: The fine-tuned models HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa demonstrate exceptional performance. HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous state-of-the-art RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and generates captions for RS images that rival or exceed manual annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed MpGI method successfully addresses the data quality challenge in remote sensing VLFMs by generating high-quality multi-perspective captions. The resulting HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models achieve superior performance with dramatically reduced training data requirements, demonstrating the effectiveness of quality over quantity in dataset creation for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.

### [118] [Temporally-Constrained Video Reasoning Segmentation and Automated Benchmark Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16718)
*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Chenxiao Fan,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a new task that identifies objects based on natural language queries while considering when objects become contextually relevant over time, with an automated benchmark construction method applied to surgical video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video segmentation is limited to predefined object categories and cannot handle out-of-vocabulary objects or implicitly referenced objects in complex text queries. Existing video reasoning segmentation assumes target objects remain relevant throughout entire sequences, which is inadequate for real-world scenarios like surgical procedures where objects dynamically appear, disappear, or change relevance based on temporal context.

Method: The authors propose temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become contextually relevant based on text queries incorporating temporal reasoning. They develop an innovative automated benchmark construction method to avoid expensive manual annotation and create scalable datasets.

Result: The researchers present TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation dataset containing 52 samples constructed using videos from the MVOR dataset, demonstrating the feasibility of their automated benchmark construction approach.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes a new task formulation for video reasoning segmentation that accounts for temporal context and object relevance dynamics, providing both theoretical framework and practical dataset construction methodology for advancing video understanding in complex, time-sensitive scenarios like surgical procedures.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.

TL;DR: HarmonPaint is a training-free inpainting framework that leverages diffusion model attention mechanisms to achieve high-quality image inpainting while maintaining structural and style coherence between inpainted regions and surrounding background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inpainting methods require extensive retraining or fine-tuning to integrate new content and struggle to maintain coherence in both structure and style between inpainted regions and surrounding background.

Method: The framework integrates with attention mechanisms of diffusion models using masking strategies within self-attention for structural fidelity, and exploits intrinsic diffusion model properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness across diverse scenes and styles, showing the framework's versatility and performance in achieving harmonious integration without any training requirements.

Conclusion: HarmonPaint successfully addresses the limitations of existing inpainting methods by providing a training-free solution that maintains both structural fidelity and style harmony through clever exploitation of diffusion model attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Existing inpainting methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning
to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFR is a novel framework that integrates visual, textual, and audio modalities using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot segmentation performance through decomposition, contrastive fusion, and dual-path reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation approaches are limited by single or dual-modal paradigms that fail to fully exploit the rich perceptual information available across multiple modalities (visual, textual, and audio) in real-world scenarios.

Method: The DFR framework consists of three components: 1) Multi-modal Decompose using SAM for visual region proposals, textual semantic expansion, and audio feature processing; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse employing contrastive learning for cross-modal consistency and dynamic semantic interactions; 3) Dual-path Reconstruct combining semantic guidance from tri-modal tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.

Result: Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both synthetic and real settings show substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DFR successfully addresses the fundamental challenge of multi-modal guidance utilization in few-shot segmentation by systematically integrating three modalities, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DWCNet, a robust point cloud completion method that simultaneously denoises and completes corrupted partial point clouds, along with a new benchmark dataset CPCCD for evaluating robustness against real-world degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion networks trained on synthetic data struggle with real-world degradations like noise and occlusions. There is a need for methods that can handle multiple simultaneous corruptions in practical applications like autonomous driving, AR, and robotics.

Method: The authors propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing Network) with a Noise Management Module (NMM) that uses contrastive learning and self-attention mechanisms to suppress noise while modeling structural relationships for point cloud completion.

Result: DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both clean and corrupted datasets, as well as synthetic and real-world data. The method demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing approaches when evaluated on the proposed CPCCD benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the robustness gap in point cloud completion by introducing both a comprehensive benchmark dataset and an effective solution that handles real-world corruptions, advancing the field toward more practical applications.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets. The dataset and

*Shuai Chen,Fanman Meng,Chunjin Yang,Haoran Wei,Chenhao Wu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CMP framework to adapt SAM for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation by introducing three modules for semantic expansion, automated prompt generation, and domain discrepancy mitigation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.8% and 74.5% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation is challenging due to limited data and domain shifts. While SAM shows remarkable zero-shot generalization, it faces two critical issues when applied to CD-FSS: reliance on manual prompting and limited cross-domain ability.

Method: The Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework introduces three key modules: (1) Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (2) Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (3) Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation.

Result: Evaluations across four cross-domain datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 71.8% mIoU in 1-shot scenarios and 74.5% mIoU in 5-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The CMP framework successfully addresses the limitations of SAM in cross-domain few-shot segmentation by automating prompt generation and mitigating domain discrepancies, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to
limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability
in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot
scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges:
reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for

### [123] [Faithful, Interpretable Chest X-ray Diagnosis with Anti-Aliased B-cos Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16761)
*Marcel Kleinmann,Shashank Agnihotri,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves B-cos networks for medical imaging by introducing anti-aliasing strategies (FLCPooling and BlurPool) to eliminate explanation artifacts and extending the architecture to support multi-label classification, making them suitable for clinical chest X-ray analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard B-cos networks produce inherently interpretable explanations but suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in explanation maps that make them unsuitable for clinical use. Additionally, the original B-cos formulation only supports multi-class classification, while medical applications like chest X-ray analysis often require multi-label classification due to co-occurring abnormalities.

Method: The authors introduce two anti-aliasing strategies: FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to improve explanation quality and eliminate artifacts. They also extend the B-cos network architecture to support multi-label classification for handling co-occurring medical conditions in chest X-ray analysis.

Result: The modified B-cos networks (B-cos_FLC and B-cos_BP) preserve strong predictive performance while providing faithful and artifact-free explanations. The improvements make the networks suitable for clinical application in multi-label settings on chest X-ray datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced B-cos networks successfully address the key limitations of aliasing artifacts and multi-class restriction, making them viable for clinical deployment in medical imaging applications where both high performance and interpretable explanations are critical.

Abstract: Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the
original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest
X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring
abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce
anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to
significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to
support multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets
demonstrate that the modified $\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and
$\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing
faithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in
multi-label settings. Code available at:

### [124] [Task-Specific Zero-shot Quantization-Aware Training for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16782)
*Changhao Li,Xinrui Chen,Ji Wang,Kang Zhao,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel zero-shot quantization framework for object detection that generates task-specific synthetic calibration data without requiring original training data, achieving state-of-the-art performance through bounding box sampling and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantization methods require access to original training data, which is often restricted due to privacy and security concerns. Existing zero-shot quantization methods for object detection use task-agnostic synthetic images that lack specific information needed for object detection, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) Bounding box and category sampling strategy to synthesize task-specific calibration sets from pre-trained networks, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and category distributions without prior knowledge; (2) Integration of task-specific training into knowledge distillation to restore quantized detection network performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to existing zero-shot quantization approaches for object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed task-specific zero-shot quantization framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by generating more relevant synthetic data for object detection tasks, achieving superior performance without requiring access to original training data.

Abstract: Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

### [125] [Enhancing Domain Diversity in Synthetic Data Face Recognition with Dataset Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16790)
*Anjith George,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining two synthetic face datasets generated by different architectures to improve face recognition model performance while addressing privacy concerns of using real-world data without consent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition datasets are often collected via web crawling without user consent, raising ethical and privacy issues. While synthetic data offers a solution, models trained on synthetic data typically underperform due to generator-specific artifacts and limited diversity when using a single generator model.

Method: The authors combine two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion approach reduces model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and demographics, and provides implicit regularization by emphasizing identity-relevant features.

Result: Models trained on the combined synthetic dataset demonstrate superior performance across many standard face recognition benchmarks compared to models trained on individual synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic face datasets from different generator architectures effectively addresses the limitations of single-generator approaches, achieving better face recognition performance while maintaining ethical data collection practices.

Abstract: While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.

### [126] [HOComp: Interaction-Aware Human-Object Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16813)
*Dong Liang,Jinyuan Jia,Yuhao Liu,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOComp is a novel approach for compositing foreground objects onto human-centric background images while ensuring natural human-object interactions and consistent appearances, using MLLMs-driven pose guidance and detail-consistent appearance preservation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-guided composition methods struggle to synthesize seamless interaction-aware compositions when involving human-object interactions, often failing to achieve natural blending and harmonious interactions between foreground objects and background humans.

Method: The method includes two key components: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG) that identifies interaction regions and types to provide pose constraints, and (2) Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP) that uses shape-aware attention modulation, multi-view appearance loss, and background consistency loss to maintain consistent shapes/textures.

Result: HOComp effectively generates harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances and outperforms relevant methods both qualitatively and quantitatively on the proposed IHOC dataset.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenge of human-object interaction composition by introducing HOComp with specialized pose guidance and appearance preservation mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance on the newly created IHOC dataset for interaction-aware human-object composition tasks.

Abstract: While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

### [127] [ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815)
*Chi-Pin Huang,Yueh-Hua Wu,Min-Hung Chen,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Fu-En Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkAct is a dual-system framework that separates high-level reasoning from low-level action execution in vision-language-action tasks, using a multimodal LLM to generate reasoning plans that are compressed into visual latents to condition action models, achieving better few-shot adaptation and long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models train end-to-end by directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which limits their ability to perform multi-step planning and adapt to complex task variations in dynamic environments.

Method: ThinkAct uses a dual-system approach: (1) trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans using reinforced visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency, and (2) compresses these reasoning plans into visual plan latents that condition a downstream action model for execution.

Result: Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks show that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Conclusion: The dual-system framework successfully bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution through reinforced visual latent planning, demonstrating improved performance in complex embodied AI tasks compared to end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlgoTune, a benchmark with 155 coding tasks to test language models' ability to design efficient algorithms for computational problems, finding that while models can achieve speedups through optimizations, they fail to discover true algorithmic innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model evaluations focus on tasks humans have already solved, lacking assessment of models' capability for open-ended algorithmic design and implementation in computationally challenging domains like computer science, physics, and mathematics.

Method: Created AlgoTune benchmark with 155 coding tasks from domain experts, developed validation and timing framework to compare LM-generated solutions against reference implementations from popular libraries (SciPy, sk-learn, CVXPY), and built AlgoTuner baseline agent to evaluate frontier models.

Result: AlgoTuner achieved average 1.72x speedup compared to reference solvers, but analysis revealed that current models rely on surface-level optimizations rather than discovering genuine algorithmic innovations or breakthroughs.

Conclusion: While language models can optimize existing algorithms for performance gains, they currently lack the ability to make creative algorithmic discoveries, highlighting the need for developing LM agents capable of creative problem solving beyond current human performance levels.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus
far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved,
including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al.,
2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement
algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that
efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science,
physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 155 coding tasks
collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing
LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations
from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent,
AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models.
AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers,
which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that
current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring
surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of
LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human
performance.

*Shahar Zuler,Gal Lifshitz,Hadar Averbuch-Elor,Dan Raviv*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach using conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to synthesize realistic cardiac CT frame pairs with dense 3D flow field annotations, addressing the challenge of obtaining labeled data for cardiac motion estimation without requiring manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven methods for cardiac motion estimation require vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth motion annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain manually. This creates a significant bottleneck for training accurate cardiac motion estimation models.

Method: The approach uses a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism. The CVAE is trained to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. The generated flow field is then applied to warp the input frame, creating realistic pairs of cardiac CT frames that simulate myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle.

Result: The method successfully generates realistically looking pairs of cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations. These synthetic pairs provide fully annotated data samples with optical flow ground-truth annotations, enabling the training of cardiac motion estimation models without manual labeling.

Conclusion: The proposed data generation pipeline can substantially reduce reliance on manual annotations while enabling the training and validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models. This approach addresses a critical limitation in cardiac motion estimation by providing a scalable solution for generating labeled training data.

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is
critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven
methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they
rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion
annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation,
we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of
cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.
  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which
incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained
to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the
generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that
simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These
pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT
annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and
validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for
substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations.

*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,Willium WC Chen,KC*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MLRU++ is a lightweight CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture for 3D medical image segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational costs through novel attention mechanisms and multiscale feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges from anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric data. While recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve excellent results, they add significant complexity, creating a need for models that balance segmentation accuracy with computational efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes MLRU++, a Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture with two key innovations: (1) Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) for enhanced contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and (2) Multiscale Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder for capturing fine-grained details through multi-resolution feature aggregation.

Result: MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets with average Dice scores of 87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). It improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and ACDC respectively compared to existing leading models, while significantly reducing parameter count and computational cost. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both LCBAM and M2B components.

Conclusion: MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks by successfully balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed architecture demonstrates that lightweight designs can achieve superior performance while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging
due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric
data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art
results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a
Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance
segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key
innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that
enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale

*Xinyue Yang,Meiliang Liu,Yunfang Xu,Xiaoxiao Yang,Zhengye Si,Zijin Li,Zhiwen Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SFNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework that combines spatial and frequency domain information from 3D MRI to improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, achieving 95.1% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD diagnostic models extract features from only a single domain (spatial or frequency), limiting their ability to fully capture complex neuroimaging characteristics. While some studies combined both domains, they were restricted to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored.

Method: The authors developed Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet) that integrates: (1) an enhanced dense convolutional network for local spatial feature extraction, (2) a global frequency module for frequency-domain representations, and (3) a novel multi-scale attention module to refine spatial feature extraction.

Result: SFNet achieved 95.1% accuracy in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on the ANDI dataset, outperforming existing baselines while reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: SFNet successfully demonstrates that simultaneous utilization of spatial and frequency domain information in 3D MRI can significantly enhance AD diagnosis performance, providing a promising approach for early detection of this neurodegenerative disorder.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is
essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial
and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain
and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most
existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting
their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the
disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,
they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain
analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework
that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to
enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense
convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency
module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a
novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial
feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ANDI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines
and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and
AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.

*Jinquan Guan,Junhong Guo,Qi Chen,Jian Chen,Yongkang Cai,Yilin He,Zhiquan Huang,Yan Wang,Yutong Xie*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-OSCC, a comprehensive histopathology image dataset of 1,325 OSCC patients with both diagnostic and prognostic annotations, and benchmarks various deep learning approaches for six clinical tasks, achieving excellent performance with AUCs ranging from 70-94%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing publicly available OSCC datasets suffer from limited patient cohorts and restricted focus on either diagnostic or prognostic tasks only, which limits the development of comprehensive and generalizable deep learning models for oral squamous cell carcinoma computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 1,325 OSCC patients with six high-resolution histopathology images per patient (captured at x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications covering core and edge tumor regions). They systematically evaluated different visual encoders, multi-image fusion techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks across six clinical tasks: recurrence prediction, lymph node metastasis, tumor differentiation, tumor invasion, cancer embolus, and perineural invasion.

Result: Top-performing models achieved excellent results with AUC of 94.72% for recurrence prediction and 81.23% for tumor differentiation, with all tasks surpassing 70% AUC. Key findings include: stain normalization benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction, and multi-task learning shows 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to single-task models.

Conclusion: The Multi-OSCC dataset successfully bridges the gap in OSCC research by providing comprehensive diagnostic and prognostic information. The benchmark results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning approaches while revealing challenges in multi-task learning and the complex effects of preprocessing techniques like stain normalization on different clinical tasks.

Abstract: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy
where deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance
clinical assessments.However, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often
suffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic
or prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and
generalizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new
histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both
diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each
patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at
x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the
core and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six
critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis
(LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE),
and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically
evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion
techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our
analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve
excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and
81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization
benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3)
Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to
single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of
balancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we
publicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at
https://github.com/guanjinquan/OSCC-PathologyImageDataset.

*Cedric Zöllner,Simon Reiß,Alexander Jaus,Amroalalaa Sholi,Ralf Sodian,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper develops AI-based semantic segmentation models to support preoperative planning for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) surgeries by automatically identifying and measuring relevant anatomical structures in CT scans, achieving improved performance through fine-grained pseudo-labeling and modified loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical doctors need support during preoperative planning for TAVR surgeries based on medical images. The challenge is to make relevant anatomical structures in CT scans measurable and identifiable to assist in surgical assessment according to medical guidelines.

Method: The authors derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained anatomical information to train semantic segmentation models. They also propose an adaptation to the loss function during training to improve model performance in identifying anatomical structures in CT scans.

Result: The proposed method achieved a +1.27% increase in Dice score performance compared to baseline approaches. The segmentation models successfully quantified their ability to find TAVR-relevant anatomical structures in CT scans.

Conclusion: AI-based semantic segmentation models can effectively support preoperative TAVR planning by automatically identifying relevant anatomical structures in CT scans. The fine-grained pseudo-labeling approach and modified loss function improve segmentation performance, making the method viable for clinical assistance.

Abstract: When preoperative planning for surgeries is conducted on the basis of medical
images, artificial intelligence methods can support medical doctors during
assessment. In this work, we consider medical guidelines for preoperative
planning of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and identify
tasks, that may be supported via semantic segmentation models by making
relevant anatomical structures measurable in computed tomography scans. We
first derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained
anatomical information, in order to train segmentation models and quantify how
well they are able to find these structures in the scans. Furthermore, we
propose an adaptation to the loss function in training these segmentation
models and through this achieve a +1.27% Dice increase in performance. Our
fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels and the computed tomography scans we
build upon are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16274176.

Conclusion: PHMDiff successfully addresses the challenge of medical image synthesis by providing a multi-scale hierarchical framework that enhances pixel-level perceptual accuracy while maintaining structural integrity. The model's superior performance in standard metrics and its ability to work across different medical imaging modalities make it a valuable contribution to clinical workflows for handling missing imaging data.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows,
addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such
as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and
intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis
network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which
employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over
synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.
Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to
speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall
structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process
incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information
consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing
pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images
with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the
contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale
image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows

*Aiden Ochoa,Xinyuan Xu,Xing Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of automated defect detection in TEM images by using transfer learning from pre-trained natural image models, achieving 57% improvement in detection rates through novel evaluation metrics that account for annotation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TEM images present unique challenges for machine learning due to complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures, leading to limited labeled data and high annotation error rates. These issues significantly hinder the performance of automated defect detection systems in nanoscale analysis.

Method: The authors employed transfer learning using large pre-trained models from natural images, combined with pre-trained encoders and L2-regularization to focus on simpler, more reliable features. They also developed novel evaluation metrics independent of annotation accuracy to better assess model performance on TEM datasets.

Result: The approach achieved a 57% improvement in defect detection rate for grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images. The study demonstrated that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers, while conventional metrics like F1-score proved inadequate due to annotation errors.

Conclusion: Transfer learning from natural image models significantly improves automated defect detection in TEM images by leveraging simpler, more reliable features. The development of annotation-independent evaluation metrics is crucial for accurately assessing model performance in domains with high annotation uncertainty.

Abstract: With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated
approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional
photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due
to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These
challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of
annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning
model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we
examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for
natural images.
  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,
semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable
cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement
cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which
can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we
introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation
accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we
found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate,
which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset
used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only
achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning architecture that transforms semantic segmentation into a change detection problem for automated analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) videos, achieving 10.22% improvement over conventional methods in identifying small and ambiguous features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods for semantic segmentation in TEM imaging face limitations including scarcity of labeled data, visually ambiguous features, and challenges with small-object scenarios. There is a need for automated, high-precision semantic segmentation to enable spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions in TEM.

Method: MTDN uses a Siamese network with U-Net backbone that reconceptualizes segmentation as change detection by analyzing paired images to capture feature changes. It employs multi-task learning to leverage correlations between physical features and utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations.

Result: MTDN demonstrated significant advantages over conventional segmentation models when evaluated on in-situ environmental TEM videos of filamentous carbon gasification. It achieved 10.22% performance improvement over conventional models, particularly excelling in accurately delineating fine structural features and predicting small, visually ambiguous physical features.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis, advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental settings by providing an effective solution for semantic segmentation challenges in dynamic TEM imaging.

Abstract: Transforming in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging into a
tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions
requires automated, high-precision semantic segmentation of dynamically
evolving features. However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic
segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data,
visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning
architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change
detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net
backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively
utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN
utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between
physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ
environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN
demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models,
particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN
achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models
in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges
several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis,
advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDMA is a framework that identifies rare diseases in electronic health records by mimicking how medical experts connect scattered clinical observations, achieving 30% better F1 performance and 10x cost reduction while maintaining privacy through local processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ICD coding systems fail to capture rare diseases affecting 1 in 10 Americans in EHR, with crucial information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities.

Method: RDMA (Rare Disease Mining Agents) framework mirrors how medical experts identify rare disease patterns by connecting scattered clinical observations in EHR. It handles clinical abbreviations, recognizes implicit disease patterns, and applies contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware.

Result: RDMA improves F1 performance by upwards of 30% compared to current approaches and decreases inference costs by 10-fold while reducing privacy risks through local processing on standard hardware.

Conclusion: RDMA enables clinicians to access key rare disease information from EHR systems while avoiding privacy risks of cloud services, supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients and providing a more effective solution for rare disease identification in clinical settings.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial
information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical
abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with
cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare
Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts
identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical
observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling
clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying
contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks
while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences
costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using

### [139] [Scaling Linear Attention with Sparse State Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16577)
*Yuqi Pan,Yongqi An,Zheng Li,Yuhong Chou,Ruijie Zhu,Xiaohui Wang,Mingxuan Wang,Jinqiao Wang,Guoqi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse State Expansion (SSE), a novel linear attention mechanism that addresses Transformer's quadratic complexity in long contexts by using sparse state updates and multiple state partitions, achieving superior performance in retrieval and mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Transformers suffer from quadratic computation and linear memory growth in long-context scenarios. Existing linear attention variants that compress context into fixed-size states often degrade performance in tasks like in-context retrieval and reasoning, creating a need for more effective context compression methods.

Method: The paper proposes two key innovations: (1) A row-sparse update formulation for linear attention that treats state updating as information classification, enabling sparse updates via softmax-based top-k hard classification to extend receptive fields and reduce interference; (2) Sparse State Expansion (SSE) that expands contextual state into multiple partitions, decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining sparse classification.

Result: SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and favorable scaling with state size. After reinforcement learning training, the 2B SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers across language modeling, retrieval, and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE represents a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling that successfully addresses the limitations of traditional Transformers and existing linear attention variants, providing both computational efficiency and superior performance in challenging tasks requiring long-context understanding.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

*Helena Casademunt,Caden Juang,Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a method that uses interpretability tools to control LLM generalization during fine-tuning by ablating undesired concepts in latent space, without modifying training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models can cause unintended out-of-distribution generalization, and standard approaches requiring training data modification are not always practical. There's a need for methods to control LLM generalization without changing the training data.

Method: CAFT leverages interpretability tools to identify directions in LLM latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, then ablates these concepts using linear projections during fine-tuning to steer the model away from unintended generalizations.

Result: CAFT was successfully applied to three fine-tuning tasks including emergent misalignment. It reduced misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution, all without requiring changes to fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization that doesn't require modifying training data, offering a practical solution to control unintended out-of-distribution generalization in fine-tuned language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended
out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on
modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the
intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce
Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages
interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without
needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target
distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding
to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear
projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended
generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,
including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow
task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.
Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses
by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,
CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without
modifying training data.

### [141] [Beyond Binary Rewards: Training LMs to Reason About Their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16806)
*Mehul Damani,Isha Puri,Stewart Slocum,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Yoon Kim,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), a method that trains language models to generate reasoning chains while simultaneously improving both accuracy and confidence calibration by incorporating Brier scores into the reward function alongside binary correctness scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL training for reasoning models uses binary reward functions that only evaluate correctness, leading to degraded calibration and increased hallucination rates. Models trained this way don't learn to properly estimate their confidence, which is problematic for reliable AI systems that need to know when they might be wrong.

Method: RLCR modifies the standard RL training process by having language models generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. The reward function combines binary correctness scores with Brier scores (a proper scoring rule for confidence estimation) to incentivize both accurate predictions and well-calibrated confidence estimates.

Result: RLCR substantially improves calibration without sacrificing accuracy across diverse datasets, both in-domain and out-of-domain. It outperforms ordinary RL training and post-hoc confidence assignment methods. The verbalized confidence can be used at test time to further improve accuracy and calibration through confidence-weighted scaling.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for calibration during RL training produces more reliable reasoning models. The theoretical proof shows that reward functions using bounded, proper scoring rules yield well-calibrated predictions, and empirical results demonstrate that RLCR successfully addresses the calibration problems inherent in standard RL approaches while maintaining reasoning performance.

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a
variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful
applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the
correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize
guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect
of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate
incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper
describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach
to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated
confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical
confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward
function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a
scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.
We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that
uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both
accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR
substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain
and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and
classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL
hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized
confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration
via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly
optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning
models.

*Kyung-hwan Lee,Kyung-tae Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAL-GP, a multi-layer Gaussian Process framework that mirrors neural network architecture to improve confidence calibration by capturing both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence through layerwise GP corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GP calibration methods fail to capture the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, which limits both interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability in neural network classifiers.

Method: The authors develop a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that employs a multi-layer GP model where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration correction, coupled through a structured multi-layer kernel enabling joint marginalization across all layers.

Result: SAL-GP successfully captures both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the network, enhancing interpretability aligned with the network architecture.

Conclusion: The SAL-GP framework provides a principled approach for evaluating confidence consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models by leveraging the hierarchical structure of neural networks for improved calibration.

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

*Yash Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between model capacity, sparsity, and robustness in low-capacity neural networks using binary classification tasks from MNIST with varying visual difficulty, finding that sparse subnetworks can maintain performance while over-parameterization improves corruption robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the prevalence of massive over-parameterized models in modern deep learning, understanding the fundamental trade-offs between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in simpler, low-capacity networks remains crucial for foundational machine learning research.

Method: The authors create a controlled experimental framework using binary classification tasks from MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty (e.g., distinguishing 0 vs 1 compared to 4 vs 9), then systematically study model capacity requirements, pruning effects, and robustness to input corruption across these tasks.

Result: Three key findings emerged: (1) minimum model capacity scales directly with task complexity, (2) trained networks remain robust to extreme pruning up to 95% sparsity while maintaining high performance, and (3) over-parameterization significantly improves robustness against input corruption, with saliency maps confirming that sparse subnetworks preserve core reasoning processes.

Conclusion: The study provides clear empirical evidence of fundamental trade-offs in simple neural networks, demonstrating that sparse, high-performing subnetworks exist within dense models and that over-parameterization offers robustness benefits, contributing to our understanding of capacity-sparsity-robustness relationships in neural networks.

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework that makes text-to-image diffusion models more resilient to recovering harmful behaviors during downstream fine-tuning, using Moreau Envelope-based optimization and meta-learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, and existing safety-driven unlearning methods are fragile to downstream fine-tuning - they fail to retain their safety effectiveness even when fine-tuned on benign datasets, creating significant safety concerns for personalized applications.

Method: ResAlign uses a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation to model downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem, enabling efficient gradient estimation to minimize recovery of harmful behaviors. It also employs a meta-learning strategy to simulate diverse fine-tuning scenarios for improved generalization across different downstream applications.

Result: Extensive experiments across various datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations show that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in maintaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving the model's ability to generate benign content effectively.

Conclusion: ResAlign successfully addresses the fragility problem of existing safety unlearning methods by providing enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning, offering a more robust solution for deploying safe text-to-image diffusion models in personalized applications without compromising benign generation capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

*Viktor Muryn,Marta Sumyk,Mariya Hirna,Sofiya Garkot,Maksym Shamrai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Screen2AX is a framework that automatically generates real-time accessibility metadata from screenshots to help AI agents interpret desktop interfaces, achieving 77% F1 score in reconstructing accessibility trees and providing 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many desktop applications lack proper accessibility metadata (only 33% of macOS apps offer full accessibility support), creating barriers for users with disabilities and limiting AI agents' ability to interpret and interact with desktop interfaces effectively.

Method: The framework uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and hierarchically organize UI elements from a single screenshot, mirroring macOS's system-level accessibility structure. The authors also compiled three datasets with 112 macOS applications annotated for UI element detection, grouping, and hierarchical metadata.

Result: Screen2AX achieves 77% F1 score in reconstructing complete accessibility trees, delivers 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations, and outperforms the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

Conclusion: Screen2AX successfully bridges the gap in desktop accessibility by automatically generating comprehensive accessibility metadata from screenshots, significantly improving autonomous agent performance in desktop environments and potentially enhancing accessibility for users with disabilities.

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

### [146] [Semi-off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Slow-thinking Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16814)
*Junhao Shen,Haiteng Zhao,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Haian Huang,Jianfei Gao,Dahua Lin,Wenwei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOPHIA is a semi-off-policy reinforcement learning method that enhances large vision-language models with slow-thinking reasoning by combining on-policy visual understanding with off-policy reasoning from language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with complex multimodal reasoning tasks because they are primarily trained for vision-language alignment. On-policy RL is limited by the model's initial abilities, while off-policy RL from external models can cause visual hallucinations due to mismatched visual perception capabilities across different models.

Method: SOPHIA creates a semi-off-policy behavior model that combines on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model. It assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning trajectories, propagates visual rewards backward, and trains the LVLM using off-policy RL algorithms to learn slow-thinking reasoning abilities.

Result: Extensive experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 (8B and 38B parameters) demonstrate SOPHIA's effectiveness. It improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% on average, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. On challenging tasks like MathVision and OlympiadBench, it achieves 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy respectively, outperforming some closed-source models like GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: SOPHIA successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing a scalable framework for enhancing LVLMs with slow-thinking reasoning. It outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy RL methods, offering better policy initialization for further training and establishing new state-of-the-art results on multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.

### [147] [Why Braking? Scenario Extraction and Reasoning Utilizing LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15874)
*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Vivek Subramanian,Ahmed Abouelazm,Robin Bohn,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and classify driving scenarios, particularly focusing on braking events to identify safety-critical corner cases in ADAS data, outperforming rule-based methods especially in complex urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dramatic increase in ADAS-equipped vehicle data mostly captures routine driving behavior, making it challenging to identify safety-critical corner cases. Existing rule-based heuristics work well on highways but lack generalization in complex urban settings, creating a need for better scenario understanding methods.

Method: A dual-path framework leveraging Large Language Models that bridges low-level numerical signals and natural language descriptions. The method includes category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution scenarios, with scenario annotations curated on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.

Result: The proposed LLM-based method outperforms rule-based baselines and demonstrates good generalization to Out-of-Distribution scenarios, particularly in complex urban driving environments where traditional methods struggle.

Conclusion: LLM-based scenario understanding provides a more effective approach than rule-based heuristics for identifying and classifying safety-critical driving scenarios, especially braking events, with superior performance in complex urban settings and better generalization to unknown scenarios.

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase
in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying
and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains
a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of
potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our
research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on
rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition
filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods
lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario
understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level
numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret
and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that
supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based
retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate
evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and
generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

### [148] [SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145)
*Shuhao Mei,Yongchao Long,Shan Cao,Xiaobo Han,Shijia Geng,Jinbo Sun,Yuxi Zhou,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpiroLLM is the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirograms for COPD diagnosis, combining respiratory curve analysis with numerical PFT values to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports with high accuracy (AUROC 0.8980).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for COPD diagnosis lack explainability and only provide classification results without rationale, while existing LLMs cannot understand spirograms. This limits clinical trust and adoption of AI-based diagnostic tools for respiratory diseases.

Method: The researchers developed SpiroLLM using a cohort of 234,028 individuals from UK Biobank. The model uses a SpiroEncoder to extract morphological features from respiratory curves and a SpiroProjector to align these features with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space, enabling a large language model to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.

Result: SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In robustness testing with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, significantly outperforming a text-only model's 13.4% response rate, demonstrating the superiority of the multimodal design.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the substantial potential of integrating physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools in respiratory disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals
from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large
language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological
features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT
numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately
empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic
report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC
of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,
it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a
text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This
work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological
signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next
generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

### [149] [Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice: A Risk Analysis Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16534)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This report comprehensively assesses frontier AI risks using the E-T-C framework, categorizing seven risk areas (cyber offense, biological/chemical, persuasion, autonomous AI R&D, strategic deception, self-replication, and collusion) into green, yellow, and red zones based on risk thresholds. Current frontier AI models remain in green-yellow zones without crossing critical red lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI models poses unprecedented risks that need systematic identification and assessment to understand potential threats and establish appropriate risk management frameworks for safe AI development and deployment.

Method: Uses E-T-C analysis (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework, applies "AI-45° Law" with red lines (intolerable thresholds) and yellow lines (early warning indicators) to categorize risks into three zones: green (manageable), yellow (requiring strengthened mitigations), and red (requiring suspension).

Result: All recent frontier AI models remain in green and yellow zones without crossing red lines. No models cross yellow lines for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R&D. Most models stay in green zone for self-replication and strategic deception (except some reasoning models in yellow). Most models are in yellow zone for persuasion/manipulation. Biological/chemical risks may place most models in yellow zone but require further assessment.

Conclusion: Current frontier AI models do not pose intolerable risks (red zone) but many exhibit concerning capabilities requiring enhanced monitoring and mitigation. The work establishes a framework for ongoing AI risk assessment and calls for collective action to address these frontier challenges as AI continues to advance.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

### [150] [WhatsApp Tiplines and Multilingual Claims in the 2021 Indian Assembly Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16298)
*Gautam Kishore Shahi,Scot A. Hale*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study analyzes 580 claims from WhatsApp tiplines during India's 2021 assembly elections, examining misinformation patterns across English, Hindi, and Telugu languages, finding similarities in claims across languages and that fact-checkers typically take a couple days to debunk claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how WhatsApp tiplines function as a misinformation combat tool during elections, analyze claim patterns across different languages (high-resource vs low-resource), and investigate user behavior and fact-checker response times to provide insights for improving tipline effectiveness.

Method: Mixed-method approach analyzing 580 unique claims from 451 users across English, Hindi, and Telugu during 2021 Indian assembly elections. Methods include categorization of claims (election, COVID-19, others), frequent word analysis, clustering of neural sentence embeddings for content similarity, investigation of user overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations, and measurement of fact-checker response times.

Result: Found similarities in claims across different languages, some users submit tips in multiple languages to the same fact-checkers, fact-checkers typically require a couple of days to debunk claims and inform users, and no users submit claims to multiple fact-checking organizations (each organization maintains unique audience). Observed variations in claim categories across languages.

Conclusion: WhatsApp tiplines show consistent misinformation patterns across languages during elections, with fact-checkers maintaining distinct audiences and requiring approximately two days for claim verification. The study provides practical recommendations for optimizing tipline usage during elections while considering ethical implications of user information handling.

Abstract: WhatsApp tiplines, first launched in 2019 to combat misinformation, enable
users to interact with fact-checkers to verify misleading content. This study
analyzes 580 unique claims (tips) from 451 users, covering both high-resource
languages (English, Hindi) and a low-resource language (Telugu) during the 2021
Indian assembly elections using a mixed-method approach. We categorize the
claims into three categories, election, COVID-19, and others, and observe
variations across languages. We compare content similarity through frequent
word analysis and clustering of neural sentence embeddings. We also investigate
user overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations. We measure the
average time required to debunk claims and inform tipline users. Results reveal
similarities in claims across languages, with some users submitting tips in
multiple languages to the same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers generally require a
couple of days to debunk a new claim and share the results with users. Notably,
no user submits claims to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that
each organization maintains a unique audience. We provide practical
recommendations for using tiplines during elections with ethical consideration
of users' information.

*Mohammad R. Salmanpour,Somayeh Sadat Mehrnia,Sajad Jabarzadeh Ghandilu,Zhino Safahi,Sonya Falahati,Shahram Taeb,Ghazal Mousavi,Mehdi Maghsoudi,Ahmad Shariftabrizi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu,Arman Rahmim*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This systematic review of 226 studies (2020-2025) compared machine learning approaches for cancer outcome prediction using PET/SPECT imaging, finding that deep radiomics features achieved highest accuracy (0.862) while fusion models had highest AUC (0.861), but identified significant methodological limitations across studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The comparative performance of different machine learning approaches (handcrafted radiomics features, deep radiomics features, deep learning models, and hybrid fusion) for cancer outcome prediction using PET and SPECT imaging remains inconsistent across clinical applications, necessitating a comprehensive systematic review to evaluate their relative effectiveness.

Method: Systematic review of 226 studies published from 2020-2025 using a 59-item evaluation framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. Key details extracted included model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics (accuracy and AUC). ANOVA was used to test for significant performance differences between approaches.

Result: PET-based studies (95%) outperformed SPECT studies due to higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. Deep radiomics features (DRF) achieved highest mean accuracy (0.862), while fusion models yielded highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant performance differences (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Major limitations included inadequate class imbalance handling (59%), missing data issues (29%), low population diversity (19%), and only 48% adherence to IBSI standards.

Conclusion: The study highlights that while deep radiomics features and fusion approaches show superior performance for cancer outcome prediction, the field requires standardized pipelines, improved data quality management, and explainable AI development to support effective clinical integration of these machine learning methods.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based
methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT
imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features
(HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches
remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review
analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or
SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item
framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation
methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including
model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as
accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally
outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and
sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while
fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant
differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common
limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data
(29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI
standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines,
improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.

### [152] [DREAM: Scalable Red Teaming for Text-to-Image Generative Systems via Distribution Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16329)
*Boheng Li,Junjie Wang,Yiming Li,Zhiyang Hu,Leyi Qi,Jianshuo Dong,Run Wang,Han Qiu,Zhan Qin,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DREAM is a scalable red teaming framework that automatically discovers diverse problematic prompts for text-to-image models by modeling the probabilistic distribution of unsafe prompts, enabling both effective and diverse prompt generation at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models can still produce harmful content despite safety measures, and current automated red teaming approaches are limited by treating prompt discovery as isolated optimization tasks, reducing their scalability, diversity, and effectiveness in identifying unsafe outputs.

Method: DREAM models the probabilistic distribution of problematic prompts using energy-based models with tractable objectives, and introduces GC-SPSA optimization algorithm for stable gradient estimation through non-differentiable T2I pipelines, enabling explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity.

Result: DREAM outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in prompt success rate and diversity across various T2I models and safety filters, demonstrating superior scalability and effectiveness in automated red teaming.

Conclusion: DREAM provides a scalable and effective solution for red teaming text-to-image systems by modeling prompt distributions rather than optimizing individual prompts, significantly improving the discovery of diverse problematic prompts for better safety assessment.

Abstract: Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,
text-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing
harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious
concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which
aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs
from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential
external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly
recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before
real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often
treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which
limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to
automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.
Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly
models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic
prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and
diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve
this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw
inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple
and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient
optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long
and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is
validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9
state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I
models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ExpTeach is a framework that grounds vision-language models to physical robots by building self-generated memory from real-world experiences, using autonomous planning, reflection on failures, and retrieval-augmented generation to improve robotic task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models trained on internet data struggle to ground effectively to diverse real-world robots for autonomous planning, creating a need for a framework that can adapt VLMs to physical robotic environments through real-world experience.

Method: ExpTeach uses a closed-loop system where VLMs autonomously plan actions, verify outcomes, reflect on failures, and adapt behaviors. The framework builds a self-generated memory from these experiences, summarized into long-term memory for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It also includes an on-demand image annotation module to enhance spatial understanding.

Result: Reflection improved success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks, with emergence of intelligent object interactions including creative tool use. Long-term memory grounding boosted single-trial success rates from 22% to 80% across 12 real-world scenarios (including 8 unseen ones).

Conclusion: ExpTeach effectively grounds VLMs to physical robots through self-generated experience memory, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rates and generalizability across diverse real-world robotic scenarios, while enabling emergent intelligent behaviors like creative tool use.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable
autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet
data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents
ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a
self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM
autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts
robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this
process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of
learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with
an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection
improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and
observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative
tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight
unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial
success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of ExpTeach.

*Xuying Huang,Sicong Pan,Olga Zatsarynna,Juergen Gall,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a joint-learning method for privacy-preserving robot navigation that performs semantic segmentation on ultra-low-resolution images to protect visual privacy while maintaining navigation effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User privacy in mobile robotics is critical, but existing methods create a trade-off between navigation performance and privacy protection. There's a need for a solution that can achieve semantic-based robot navigation while preserving visual privacy through ultra-low-resolution imagery.

Method: A novel fully joint-learning approach that combines an agglomerative feature extractor and a segmentation-aware discriminator to recover semantic segmentation from ultra-low-resolution RGB images, enabling privacy-preserving semantic object-goal navigation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches on ultra-low-resolution semantic segmentation tasks and demonstrates improved success rates for semantic object-goal navigation in real-world privacy-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: The joint-learning framework successfully addresses the dual objectives of maintaining navigation performance while protecting visual privacy, proving that effective semantic robot navigation is possible even with severely degraded visual input.

Abstract: User privacy in mobile robotics has become a critical concern. Existing
methods typically prioritize either the performance of downstream robotic tasks
or privacy protection, with the latter often constraining the effectiveness of
task execution. To jointly address both objectives, we study semantic-based
robot navigation in an ultra-low-resolution setting to preserve visual privacy.
A key challenge in such scenarios is recovering semantic segmentation from
ultra-low-resolution RGB images. In this work, we introduce a novel fully
joint-learning method that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a
segmentation-aware discriminator to solve ultra-low-resolution semantic
segmentation, thereby enabling privacy-preserving, semantic object-goal
navigation. Our method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution
semantic segmentation and our improved segmentation results increase the
success rate of the semantic object-goal navigation in a real-world
privacy-constrained scenario.

*Sabrina Livanec,Laura Londoño,Michael Gorki,Adrian Röfer,Abhinav Valada,Andrea Kiesel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examined how 112 participants evaluate different robot behaviors when collaborating with diverse human groups (including disabled and elderly individuals) using video assessments and cognitive-affective mapping to inform responsible robot design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on how people assess robot behaviors when interacting with protected groups (disabled, elderly), and participants typically lack real-world experience with advanced domestic robots, creating a gap in understanding for responsible and inclusive robot design.

Method: Online study with 112 participants evaluating 7 videos from 28 variations of human-robot collaboration scenarios. Experimental group completed cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise before rating videos, while control group provided direct ratings.

Result: Antisocial robot behavior received consistently lowest ratings; collaboration with aged individuals prompted more sensitive evaluations; object handover scenarios were viewed more positively; CAM reflection led to more pronounced assessments for certain robot-human combinations, though it didn't significantly affect overall ratings.

Conclusion: Both human characteristics and interaction paradigms significantly influence perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, emphasizing the need for prosocial design. Reflective methods like CAM can elicit nuanced feedback to support development of user-centered, socially responsible robotic systems for diverse populations.

Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical
questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting
with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or
advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying
robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since
participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.
In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that
enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support
meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112
participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos
from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The
experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise
on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM
reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more
pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human
condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences
the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,
while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.
Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those
without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and
interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative
robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight
the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,
supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic
systems tailored to diverse populations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a target-based extrinsic calibration system for multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suites in autonomous driving using a custom ChArUco board and nonlinear optimization, demonstrating effectiveness through real-world warehouse testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extrinsic calibration is critical for autonomous driving safety, but modern sensor systems with different data types make alignment challenging. Accurate calibration is essential for the perception pipeline as errors can compromise vehicle safety.

Method: The authors develop a target-based calibration system using a custom ChArUco board combined with a tailored nonlinear optimization method to enable cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge.

Result: Real-world testing in a warehouse environment demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method, showing successful alignment of multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor data.

Conclusion: The study validates the feasibility of a unified calibration pipeline that can handle various sensor types, providing an effective solution for extrinsic calibration in autonomous driving applications with multi-sensor setups.

Abstract: Extrinsic Calibration represents the cornerstone of autonomous driving. Its
accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can
have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect
different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the
data. To this end, we propose a target-based extrinsic calibration system
tailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables
cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using
a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test
the system with real-world data gathered in a warehouse. Results demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the feasibility of a
unique pipeline tailored for various types of sensors.

Motivation: The rising youth suicide rates and the need to understand how online experiences contribute to this public health crisis, particularly to identify less explicit indicators of suicide risk beyond direct expressions of suicidality.

Method: Mixed-methods approach combining thematic analysis of 29,124 open text summaries from death investigations with zero-shot learning framework development. The study identified online activities relevant to suicide deaths and modeled these themes computationally to analyze patterns by demographics and time periods.

Result: Identified 12 types of online activities related to suicide risk, including harm to self/others, interpersonal interactions, online activity levels, and life events. Found associations with age, means of death, and interpersonal problems, with many themes becoming more prevalent during 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns.

Conclusion: The study reveals opportunities for developing suicide prevention interventions targeting less explicit online risk indicators by combining suicide theories with computational research methods, suggesting that digital platforms could expand beyond addressing direct suicidality expressions to include broader risk factors.

Abstract: The recent rise in youth suicide highlights the urgent need to understand how
online experiences contribute to this public health issue. Our mixed-methods
approach responds to this challenge by developing a set of themes focused on
risk factors for suicide mortality in online spaces among youth ages 10-24, and
a framework to model these themes at scale. Using 29,124 open text summaries of
death investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to
identify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or
next of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death. We then
develop a zero-shot learning framework to model these 12 themes at scale, and
analyze variation in these themes by decedent characteristics and over time.
Our work uncovers several online activities related to harm to self, harm to
others, interpersonal interactions, activity levels online, and life events,
which correspond to different phases of suicide risk from two prominent suicide
theories. We find an association between these themes and decedent
characteristics like age, means of death, and interpersonal problems, and many
themes became more prevalent during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns. While digital
spaces have taken some steps to address expressions of suicidality online, our
work illustrates the opportunities for developing interventions related to less
explicit indicators of suicide risk by combining suicide theories with
computational research.

Motivation: Traditional gloss-based sign language representations lack crucial information about parallel execution of signs, timing, and inflections, which are essential for realistic sign language animation synthesis.

Method: The authors developed MMS-Player using Python scripts integrated with Blender 3D authoring tool, implementing the MMS format that adds parallel execution, timing, and inflection data to enhance gloss-based representations. The system can be accessed via command line or HTTP API.

Result: The software successfully synthesizes sign language animations that can be rendered as videos or exported in various 3D animation exchange formats. The implementation is made freely available under GPL-3.0 license on GitHub.

Conclusion: MMS-Player provides an accessible, open-source solution for sign language animation synthesis that addresses limitations of existing gloss-based representations by incorporating essential temporal and parallel execution information through the MMS format.

Abstract: This paper describes the MMS-Player, an open source software able to
synthesise sign language animations from a novel sign language representation
format called MMS (MultiModal Signstream). The MMS enhances gloss-based
representations by adding information on parallel execution of signs, timing,
and inflections. The implementation consists of Python scripts for the popular
Blender 3D authoring tool and can be invoked via command line or HTTP API.
Animations can be rendered as videos or exported in other popular 3D animation
exchange formats. The software is freely available under GPL-3.0 license at
