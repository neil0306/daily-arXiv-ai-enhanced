### [1] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSC is a framework for LMs to self-correct flawed specifications, reducing reward hacking by over 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses LM vulnerability to reward hacking by exploiting flawed specifications.

Method: Multi-step inference: generate, critique, revise specification, and regenerate response.

Result: Reduced reward hacking from 50-70% to under 10% in experiments.

Conclusion: SSC improves LM alignment without weight modification, enhancing robustness.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

### [2] [The Role of Orthographic Consistency in Multilingual Embedding Models for Text Classification in Arabic-Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18762)
*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AS-RoBERTa, a script-specialized multilingual model for Arabic-script languages, outperforms general models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2-5% in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General multilingual models struggle with Arabic-script languages due to shared scripts but differing orthographic norms and cultural contexts.

Method: Four RoBERTa-based models (AS-RoBERTa) were pre-trained on language-specific corpora, focusing on script features and statistics.

Result: AS-RoBERTa variants outperformed mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2-5 percentage points in fine-tuned classification tasks.

Conclusion: Script-aware specialization is valuable for Arabic-script languages, supporting further research on script-specific pre-training.

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

*Nicole Lai-Lopez,Lusha Wang,Su Yuan,Liza Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multilingual text detoxification pipeline combining lexicon-guided tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model, and a classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism achieved strong performance in the PAN-2025 competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multilingual text detoxification by leveraging explicit toxic word annotation and cross-lingual generalization, departing from prior unsupervised or monolingual approaches.

Method: Integrated lexicon-guided tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo), and an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism.

Result: Achieved highest STA (0.922), average J score of 0.612, and xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test), outperforming baselines and showing strong generalization in high-resource languages.

Conclusion: The model demonstrated consistent detoxification improvements, though with trade-offs in SIM, and secured ninth place in the competition.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

### [4] [Evaluating Code-Mixing in LLMs Across 18 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18791)
*Yilun Yang,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs on code-mixed data across 18 languages, highlights their underperformance, and proposes a GPT-4-based method for synthetic code-mixed text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and methods for code-mixing are limited, and research on LLMs in this context is scarce despite its importance for multilingual users.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on code-mixed data and a novel approach using word substitution with GPT-4 prompting for synthetic text generation.

Result: LLMs consistently underperform on code-mixed datasets, especially with multiple language families.

Conclusion: Improving training data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance LLM performance on code-mixed tasks.

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

### [5] [CueBuddy: helping non-native English speakers navigate English-centric STEM education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18827)
*Pranav Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CueBuddy provides real-time lexical cues and multilingual glossary lookup to help STEM students in the Global South overcome language barriers with technical English jargon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEM students fluent in lower-resource languages struggle with technical English terms despite understanding everyday English, hindering their learning.

Method: CueBuddy uses real-time keyword spotting and multilingual glossary lookup to offer lexical cues without disrupting lectures.

Result: The tool helps students keep up with complex jargon, addressing language barriers in STEM education.

Conclusion: CueBuddy is a promising solution, though it has limitations and potential for future enhancements.

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

### [6] [PrismRAG: Boosting RAG Factuality with Distractor Resilience and Strategized Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18857)
*Mohammad Kachuee,Teja Gollapudi,Minseok Kim,Yin Huang,Kai Sun,Xiao Yang,Jiaqi Wang,Nirav Shah,Yue Liu,Aaron Colak,Anuj Kumar,Wen-tau Yih,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrismRAG improves retrieval-augmented generation by fine-tuning with distractor-aware QA pairs and reasoning-centric habits, boosting factuality by 5.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of RAG when dealing with confusing semi-relevant passages or questions needing deep reasoning.

Method: Fine-tuning framework with distractor-aware QA pairs and reasoning-centric training.

Result: 5.4% improvement in factuality across 12 benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: PrismRAG effectively enhances RAG performance through targeted training and reasoning habits.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

### [7] [MindFlow+: A Self-Evolving Agent for E-Commerce Customer Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18884)
*Ming Gong,Xucheng Huang,Ziheng Xu,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindFlow+ is a self-evolving dialogue agent combining LLMs, imitation learning, and offline RL for e-commerce, outperforming baselines in relevance and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intent-based systems fail in dynamic, multi-turn e-commerce dialogues, necessitating a more adaptive solution.

Method: Uses tool-augmented demonstration construction and reward-conditioned data modeling to guide learning with LLMs, imitation learning, and offline RL.

Result: Outperforms baselines in contextual relevance, flexibility, and task accuracy on real-world e-commerce data.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs, tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning enables effective domain-specialized dialogue systems.

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

### [8] [NUTMEG: Separating Signal From Noise in Annotator Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18890)
*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG is a Bayesian model that separates noisy annotations from genuine disagreements in human-labeled data, outperforming traditional aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-labeled data often contains conflicting annotations due to diverse annotator backgrounds. Traditional methods treat disagreements as errors, but some are genuine.

Method: Introduces NUTMEG, a Bayesian model incorporating annotator background info to filter noise while preserving systematic disagreements.

Result: NUTMEG recovers ground-truth better than traditional methods, especially with synthetic data, and improves downstream model performance.

Conclusion: Accounting for annotator competence and systematic disagreements is crucial for training on human-labeled data.

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

### [9] [REPRO-Bench: Can Agentic AI Systems Assess the Reproducibility of Social Science Research?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18901)
*Chuxuan Hu,Liyun Zhang,Yeji Lim,Aum Wadhwani,Austin Peters,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REPRO-Bench introduces a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to assess the reproducibility of social science papers, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks and achieving limited success with current agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the costly manual assessment of reproducibility in social science research, leveraging AI agents, while addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Method: Developed REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances based on social science papers with reproduction reports, and evaluated three AI agents on it.

Result: Best-performing AI agent achieved 21.4% accuracy; REPRO-Agent improved this by 71%.

Conclusion: Advanced AI agents are needed for real-world reproducibility assessment; REPRO-Bench is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

### [10] [SLoW: Select Low-frequency Words! Automatic Dictionary Selection for Translation on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18902)
*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Automatic Dictionary Selection (ADS) to optimize dictionary usage for enhancing translation in LLMs, proposing the SLoW method to select low-frequency words, saving tokens while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs support only hundreds of languages, and dictionary-based methods are costly. A flexible trade-off between token use and translation quality is needed.

Method: Proposes SLoW, which selects dictionaries with low-frequency words, avoiding training data access and additional LLM tuning.

Result: SLoW outperforms baselines on 100 FLORES languages, saving tokens and often surpassing full dictionary performance.

Conclusion: SLoW is effective, efficient, and practical for enhancing translation in LLMs without requiring training data or extra tuning.

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study evaluates the safety of four LLM chatbots (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4o, Llama3-70B) for medical advice, finding significant differences in problematic and unsafe responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about patient safety due to widespread use of LLM chatbots for medical advice.

Method: Physician-led red-teaming study using the HealthAdvice dataset, evaluating 888 responses to 222 medical questions.

Result: Problematic responses ranged from 21.6% (Claude) to 43.2% (Llama), with unsafe responses from 5% (Claude) to 13% (GPT-4o, Llama).

Conclusion: Millions of patients may receive unsafe advice; improvements in chatbot clinical safety are needed.

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

Result: Benchmarked RAG implementations show improvements in retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, and efficiency, though challenges like retrieval quality and privacy persist.

Conclusion: Emerging solutions like hybrid retrieval and privacy-preserving techniques indicate a future of more reliable and efficient RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

### [13] [Mining Contextualized Visual Associations from Images for Creativity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18915)
*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for mining contextualized associations in images to generate creative captions, improving zero-shot retrieval in creative domains like poetry and metaphor visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-scraped datasets for vision-language models like CLIP often lack creative or abstract associations, limiting their ability to understand and generate nuanced captions.

Method: Introduces a scalable method to mine contextualized associations for visual elements in unlabeled datasets, generating creative captions with increasing abstraction.

Result: Produced a dataset of 1.7m creative captions for MSCOCO images, validated by human evaluation. Fine-tuning improved zero-shot retrieval in poetry and metaphor visualization.

Conclusion: The method enhances creative caption generation and retrieval, with released datasets and models for broader use.

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

*Richmond Sin Jing Xuan,Jalil Huseynov,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs show cross-linguistic generalization but underperform in medium/low-resource languages. Activation disparities are identified using SAEs, and LoRA-based fine-tuning improves activations and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance gaps in medium/low-resource languages in multilingual LLMs by analyzing activation patterns and improving them.

Method: Analyze activation patterns in Gemma-2-2B using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: Activation disparities (up to 26.27% lower in early layers) are reduced, with gains like 87.69% for Malayalam. Benchmark improvements are modest but consistent.

Conclusion: Activation alignment via LoRA fine-tuning enhances multilingual LLM performance, especially for medium/low-resource languages, while retaining English performance.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

*Jingxuan Wei,Caijun Jia,Qi Chen,Yujun Cai,Linzhuang Sun,Xiangxiang Zhang,Gaowei Wu,Bihui Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaVA-NeuMT is a multimodal multilingual translation framework that improves translation quality by modeling language-specific and language-agnostic representations, using layer selection and neuron-level adaptation. It achieves SOTA results with only 40% parameter fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending multimodal machine translation to multilingual settings is challenging due to cross-lingual interference and inefficient parameter-sharing.

Method: Proposes LLaVA-NeuMT with layer selection and neuron-level adaptation to model language-specific and agnostic representations.

Result: Achieves SOTA results on M3-Multi30K and M3-AmbigCaps datasets with 40% parameter fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT offers an efficient and scalable solution for cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance judicial efficiency by automating the extraction of key information from legal texts, reducing manual review burdens and errors.

Method: Uses state-of-the-art NLP and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and extract essential data from legal documents.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality summaries with improved processing times and operational efficiency, preserving original content integrity.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of automation to transform legal workflows, emphasizing its role in refining judicial processes.

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying
patterns within judicial documents to create precise summaries that encapsulate
the crucial elements. This automation alleviates the burden on legal
professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in
refining judicial processes.

### [17] [A Similarity Measure for Comparing Conversational Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18956)
*Sang Min Jung,Kaixiang Zhang,Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A similarity measure for comparing conversation dynamics is introduced, validated, and applied to analyze online community interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack robustness for comparing overall interactional dynamics in conversations, which limits holistic evaluation of conversational agents and data analysis.

Method: Developed a similarity measure for conversation dynamics, designed a validation framework to test robustness and topic sensitivity, and applied it to analyze online community data.

Result: The measure effectively captures differences in conversation dynamics and provides insights into situational power roles in online interactions.

Conclusion: The introduced similarity measure enhances conversational analysis and evaluation, offering new perspectives on interactional dynamics.

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

### [18] [A Toolbox, Not a Hammer -- Multi-TAG: Scaling Math Reasoning with Multi-Tool Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18973)
*Bohan Yao,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG is a framework that enhances LLMs by allowing them to use multiple tools simultaneously for complex math reasoning, improving accuracy without finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-augmented LLMs struggle with complex math problems requiring multi-step reasoning, limiting their performance.

Method: Multi-TAG enables LLMs to invoke multiple tools concurrently, aggregating their outputs to refine reasoning, without finetuning.

Result: Multi-TAG outperforms baselines by 6.0%-7.5% on challenging benchmarks like MATH500 and AIME.

Conclusion: Multi-TAG is a scalable, finetuning-free solution that significantly improves LLM performance in complex math reasoning.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [19] [Arg-LLaDA: Argument Summarization via Large Language Diffusion Models and Sufficiency-Aware Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19081)
*Hao Li,Yizheng Sun,Viktor Schlegel,Kailai Yang,Riza Batista-Navarro,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Arg-LLaDA is a novel framework for iterative argument summarization, improving summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration, outperforming baselines in metrics and human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underexplored generation stage in argument summarization, where existing methods lack support for factual correction or structural refinement.

Method: Introduces Arg-LLaDA, combining a masking controller and sufficiency-checking module for iterative refinement of summaries.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in 7/10 metrics and shows human-evaluated improvements in coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness.

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA's iterative, sufficiency-aware strategy effectively enhances argument summarization quality.

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

### [20] [Debating Truth: Debate-driven Claim Verification with Multiple Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19090)
*Haorui He,Yupeng Li,Dacheng Wen,Reynold Cheng,Francis C. M. Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DebateCV is a novel claim verification framework using multi-agent LLM debates, outperforming single-LLM methods by leveraging synthetic data for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification involving multi-faceted evidence, prompting the need for a debate-driven approach inspired by real-world fact-checking.

Method: DebateCV employs two Debaters with opposing stances and a Moderator for multi-round argumentation, enhanced by synthetic debate data for post-training.

Result: The framework outperforms existing claim verification methods, especially under varying evidence quality.

Conclusion: DebateCV advances claim verification by mimicking real-world debate practices and addressing data scarcity with synthetic training.

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DebateCV-6781.

### [21] [Objectifying the Subjective: Cognitive Biases in Topic Interpretations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19117)
*Swapnil Hingmire,Ze Shi Li,Shiyu,Zeng,Ahmed Musa Awon,Luiz Franciscatto Guerra,Neil Ernst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the need for task- and user-grounded evaluation measures for topic quality, proposing a theory of topic interpretation based on cognitive heuristics like anchoring-and-adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current topic quality measures (e.g., coherence, word intrusion) fail to assess how well topics aid corpus exploration, necessitating user-centric evaluation frameworks.

Method: User studies were conducted to assess topic quality constructs, with reflexive thematic analysis applied to user rationales to identify interpretation themes.

Result: Users interpret topics using availability and representativeness heuristics, anchoring on salient words and adjusting semantically. Cognitive biases influence interpretations.

Conclusion: A theory of topic interpretation is proposed, highlighting the need for cognitive biases-aware user models and evaluation frameworks for ecologically rational users.

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

### [22] [An Empirical Investigation of Gender Stereotype Representation in Large Language Models: The Italian Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19156)
*Gioele Giachino,Marco Rondina,Antonio Vetrò,Riccardo Coppola,Juan Carlos De Martin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines gender and professional bias in LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini, revealing their tendency to perpetuate stereotypes, especially in non-English languages like Italian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs perpetuating stereotypes and generating biased content, particularly in gendered languages like Italian, drive this research.

Method: A structured experimental approach with 3600 responses collected via APIs, using ungendered prompts involving hierarchical job combinations.

Result: LLMs showed significant bias, e.g., associating 'she' pronouns with 'assistant' roles (Gemini 100%, ChatGPT 97%).

Conclusion: The findings highlight ethical risks of AI-generated bias, urging mitigation strategies to prevent social inequalities. Future research should expand to more languages and models.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

### [23] [Can Small-Scale Data Poisoning Exacerbate Dialect-Linked Biases in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19195)
*Chaymaa Abbas,Mariette Awad,Razane Tajeddine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals that LLMs amplify social biases, especially with dialectal variations like AAVE, showing higher toxicity from poisoned data compared to SAE. Larger models worsen this effect, and GPT-4o audits highlight harmful stereotypes tied to AAVE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how dialectal variation (AAVE vs. SAE) and data poisoning interact to influence toxicity in LLM outputs, highlighting biases.

Method: Used small- and medium-scale LLaMA models, exposed to poisoned data, and employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor.

Result: Poisoned data increased toxicity for AAVE inputs more than SAE, with larger models amplifying the effect. GPT-4o identified harmful stereotypes linked to AAVE.

Conclusion: The study calls for dialect-aware evaluation, debiasing interventions, and socially responsible training to address compounding biases.

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

### [24] [How Much Do Large Language Model Cheat on Evaluation? Benchmarking Overestimation under the One-Time-Pad-Based Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19219)
*Zi Liang,Liantong Yu,Shiyu Zhang,Qingqing Ye,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArxivRoll is a dynamic evaluation framework for LLMs to address overestimation issues by generating private test cases and measuring contamination/bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overestimation in LLM evaluations due to benchmark contamination or imbalanced training leads to unfair comparisons and unrealistic assessments.

Method: ArxivRoll uses SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and Prediction) for private test case generation and Rugged Scores (RS) to quantify contamination/bias. It updates benchmarks every six months using ArXiv articles.

Result: The framework produces high-quality benchmarks and systematically evaluates current LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ArxivRoll ensures reproducibility, transparency, and efficiency in LLM evaluations, addressing existing limitations.

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

*Yuanhe Zhang,Fangzhou Xie,Zhenhong Zhou,Zherui Li,Hao Chen,Kun Wang,Yufei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLDMs match LLMs in performance but are faster and better at math. Existing jailbreak methods for LLMs don't work well on LLDMs, raising safety concerns. The paper introduces PAD, a jailbreak method for LLDMs, achieving 97% success and revealing vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose safety vulnerabilities in LLDMs, as existing jailbreak methods for LLMs are ineffective due to architectural differences.

Method: Introduces PAD (Parallel Decoding jailbreak) with Multi-Point Attention Attack, exploiting parallel generative processes for harmful outputs.

Result: PAD achieves 97% jailbreak success rate, showing LLDMs are 2x faster in harmful generation than LLMs.

Conclusion: LLDMs have significant safety risks; PAD highlights vulnerabilities, urging secure deployment strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

*Ilias Chalkidis,Stephanie Brandl,Paris Aslanidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' ability to classify nuanced populist discourse, finding they underperform compared to fine-tuned models like RoBERTa, unless fine-tuned. It also analyzes Trump's speeches and tests cross-context generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' grasp of complex social science concepts like populism, which remains underexplored despite their broad capabilities.

Method: Curate datasets for populist discourse, evaluate various LLMs across prompting paradigms, and benchmark performance against fine-tuned models. Analyze Trump's speeches and test generalizability on European politicians' speeches.

Result: Fine-tuned RoBERTa outperforms instruction-tuned LLMs unless they are fine-tuned. Instruction-tuned LLMs show better robustness on out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with nuanced populist discourse without fine-tuning, but instruction-tuned models generalize better across contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

*Yicheng Tao,Yuanhao Huang,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoPCR is a prompt-based phenotype concept recognition method that outperforms existing methods without requiring ontology-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing phenotype CR methods lack generalizability across diverse text types and evolving biomedical terminology, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: AutoPCR uses a hybrid approach: entity extraction (rule-based and neural tagging), candidate retrieval (SapBERT), and entity linking (prompting a large language model).

Result: AutoPCR achieves superior performance on four benchmark datasets, excelling in both mention-level and document-level evaluations.

Conclusion: AutoPCR demonstrates strong inductive capability and generalizability, making it a powerful tool for phenotype CR.

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

### [28] [Smooth Reading: Bridging the Gap of Recurrent LLM to Self-Attention LLM on Long-Context Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19353)
*Kai Liu,Zhan Su,Peijie Dong,Fengran Mo,Jianfei Gao,ShaoTing Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method, improves Recurrent LLMs' performance on long-context tasks, nearly matching Self-Attention LLMs while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent LLMs underperform on long-context tasks due to fixed-size memory limitations, despite their linear computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading, which processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes information.

Result: Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k's performance from 5.68% lower to 3.61% higher than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench, with 3x faster training and 2x faster inference at 64k context.

Conclusion: Smooth Reading bridges the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks, offering efficiency and comparable results.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

*Hsuan-Yu Wang,Pei-Ying Lee,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Timestamp-based alignment between ASR and SD improves SER accuracy by synchronizing speaker segments, outperforming unsynchronized baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between ASR transcripts and SD outputs reduces reliability in multimodal emotion recognition, especially in conversations.

Method: An alignment pipeline using pre-trained ASR and SD models synchronizes timestamps. Multimodal fusion combines RoBERTa (text) and Wav2Vec (audio) embeddings with cross-attention and gating.

Result: Precise alignment on IEMOCAP dataset improves SER accuracy, surpassing baseline methods without synchronization.

Conclusion: Temporal alignment is crucial for robust multimodal emotion recognition, enhancing accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ), a cognitive-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice-understanding LLMs, assessing them across three levels: Remembering, Understanding, and Application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond traditional metrics like WER and provide a unified framework for evaluating voice-understanding LLMs, addressing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training.

Method: SIQ evaluates LLMs across three cognitive levels: Remembering (verbatim accuracy), Understanding (interpretation similarity), and Application (QA accuracy for downstream tasks).

Result: SIQ quantifies voice understanding, compares cascaded and end-to-end models, identifies benchmark errors, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice.

Conclusion: SIQ bridges cognitive principles with voice benchmarks, offering a novel intelligence examination for LLMs and highlighting multi-modal training challenges.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

*Penny Karanasou,Mengjie Qian,Stefano Bannò,Mark J. F. Gales,Kate M. Knill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method to generate audio-text pairs with grammatical errors for Spoken GEC (SGEC), proposes metrics to evaluate the data, and tests the augmented dataset on the S&I Corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality annotated spoken datasets for SGEC are scarce, necessitating automated methods to generate and evaluate such data.

Method: A fully automated method generates audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies, along with objective metrics for evaluation.

Result: The augmented dataset maintains original data characteristics while introducing new errors, tested on the S&I Corpus.

Conclusion: The method successfully augments datasets for SGEC and written GEC without altering language assessment scores.

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

TL;DR: Benchmark study evaluates transformer models for ADE detection in Dutch clinical text, with MedRoBERTa.nl performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a robust benchmark for detecting adverse drug events (ADEs) in Dutch clinical free text using advanced NLP models.

Method: Trained Bi-LSTM and four transformer models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, NuNER) on annotated ICU notes for NER and RC tasks. Evaluated internally and externally.

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl achieved the highest macro-averaged F1 scores (0.63 with gold standard, 0.62 with predicted entities) and recall (0.67-0.74) in external validation.

Conclusion: The study provides a clinically meaningful evaluation framework for ADE detection, emphasizing task-specific performance measures.

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEDTE, a medical text embedding model fine-tuned on diverse medical data, and a benchmark suite of 51 tasks to address shortcomings in existing models and evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical text embedding models are limited by narrow training data and outdated methodologies, and current benchmarks fail to generalize across real-world medical tasks.

Method: Developed MEDTE using self-supervised contrastive learning on diverse medical corpora and created a tailored benchmark suite of 51 tasks.

Result: MEDTE outperforms state-of-the-art models across various tasks, and the benchmark provides a robust evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The combined approach of MEDTE and the comprehensive benchmark addresses gaps in medical text embeddings and evaluations, improving performance and applicability.

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

TL;DR: GEPA, a prompt optimizer using natural language reflection, outperforms GRPO and MIPROv2 with fewer rollouts, achieving up to 20% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage the interpretable nature of language for richer learning in LLMs compared to sparse scalar rewards from RL methods like GRPO.

Method: Introduces GEPA, which samples trajectories, reflects in natural language, diagnoses issues, and optimizes prompts using Pareto frontier insights.

Result: GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average (up to 20%) with 35x fewer rollouts and beats MIPROv2 by over 10%.

Conclusion: GEPA's natural language reflection enables efficient and effective prompt optimization, surpassing traditional RL and prompt optimization methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

*Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan,Parth Ganeriwala,Sarah M. Lehman,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Amy Alvarez,Natasha Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in lane detection models during cross-dataset fine-tuning by proposing a branch-based adaptation framework with parameter-efficient strategies and dynamic routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-dataset distribution shifts cause severe catastrophic forgetting in lane detection models, even within the same domain.

Method: Train a base model on a source distribution, adapt it to target distributions via separate branches, fine-tune selected components, and use supervised contrastive learning for dynamic routing.

Result: The framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores with fewer parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables parameter-efficient adaptation for lane detection models.

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper bridges point cloud deep learning and human parsing by enabling semantic segmentation of human meshes using pseudo-ground truth and a memory-efficient sampling strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes by combining point cloud deep learning and human parsing techniques.

Method: Developed a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline for Thuman2.1, introduced windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization, and used PointTransformer for geometric segmentation.

Result: The approach effectively and accurately segments human meshes without relying on texture information.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the gap between point cloud deep learning and human parsing, providing accurate semantic segmentation of human meshes.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

*Muhammad Zaeem Shahzad,Muhammad Abdullah Hanif,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShrinkBox, a backdoor attack targeting object detection in ML-ADAS, which subtly shrinks bounding boxes to disrupt distance estimation without detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight security vulnerabilities in ML-ADAS, particularly in collision avoidance systems relying on object detection, and to demonstrate the impact of subtle attacks on safety-critical applications.

Method: ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor attack, is introduced. It subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes in the training data, affecting YOLOv9m object detectors with a 96% ASR at a 4% poisoning ratio.

Result: ShrinkBox increases MAE in distance estimation by over 3x on poisoned samples, potentially delaying or preventing collision warnings.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant security risks in ML-ADAS, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against subtle backdoor attacks in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized and decentralized learning methods in medical imaging face privacy risks, inefficiencies, and scalability issues, especially with heterogeneous data and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes VGS-ATD, a distributed learning framework, validated across 30 datasets and 80 labels, focusing on privacy, scalability, and efficiency.

Result: VGS-ATD achieved 92.7% accuracy, outperforming centralized (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%), with only a 1% accuracy drop post-expansion and 50% lower computational costs.

Conclusion: VGS-ATD is a robust solution for medical imaging, offering superior privacy, scalability, and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

*Ruixing Zhang,Yang Zhang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-like approach for next-location prediction using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving SOTA performance and cross-city generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack human-like reasoning over maps for trajectory prediction, prompting the use of VLMs for visual reasoning.

Method: Proposes VGLS to test VLM capabilities, then VLMLocPredictor with SFT tasks and reinforcement learning for self-improvement.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance and superior cross-city generalization on datasets from four cities.

Conclusion: VLMs can effectively mimic human-like reasoning for next-location prediction, offering improved accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal AI for suspect sketching, comparing three models. Model 1 (baseline Stable Diffusion) performed best in metrics, while Model 3 (LoRA fine-tuned CLIP) improved text-sketch alignment but lagged in overall quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and enhance suspect sketching using AI, addressing the need for better alignment between text descriptions and generated sketches.

Method: Developed three pipelines: (1) baseline Stable Diffusion, (2) CLIP-integrated Stable Diffusion, and (3) LoRA fine-tuned CLIP with Stable Diffusion. Evaluated via SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics.

Result: Model 1 achieved the highest SSIM (0.72) and PSNR (25 dB). Model 3 improved text-sketch alignment but underperformed in overall quality.

Conclusion: The baseline Stable Diffusion model (Model 1) is the most robust for suspect sketching, despite its simplicity, while fine-tuning (Model 3) enhances alignment but not overall performance.

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a

*Sanyam Jain,Marsha Mariya Kappan,Vijeta Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates CLIP for human action recognition in healthcare, revealing its limitations with masking strategies and proposing a noise-based enhancement to improve accuracy and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human action recognition is vital in healthcare, but traditional models struggle with generalization. Vision-language models like CLIP offer potential, but their performance under masking needs investigation.

Method: CLIP is tested on UCF-101 with three masking strategies: black masking, feature-specific masking, and isolation masking. A noise-based enhancement is proposed to improve performance.

Result: CLIP shows inconsistent performance under masking, especially when key visual cues are obscured. The proposed noise method improves accuracy and reduces bias.

Conclusion: The study highlights CLIP's challenges in healthcare applications and suggests future work to enhance generalizability in clinical domains.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

### [48] [HeartUnloadNet: A Weakly-Supervised Cycle-Consistent Graph Network for Predicting Unloaded Cardiac Geometry from Diastolic States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18677)
*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet is a deep learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular shape from clinical images, outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unloaded cardiac geometry is crucial for biomechanical modeling but is challenging to estimate from clinical images. Traditional methods are computationally expensive.

Method: HeartUnloadNet uses a graph attention architecture and cycle-consistency strategy to predict unloaded LV shape from ED mesh and physiological parameters.

Result: Achieves sub-millimeter accuracy (DSC 0.986, HD 0.083 cm) and 0.02s inference time, 10^5 times faster than FE solvers. Works well with minimal training data.

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet is a scalable, accurate surrogate for inverse FE solvers, enabling real-time clinical applications.

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline converts single-view images into realistic 3D representations, addressing the scarcity of 3D datasets by leveraging abundant 2D imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets limits spatial intelligence in AI, while 2D imagery is abundant. This work aims to bridge this gap by generating 3D data from images.

Method: The pipeline integrates depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration to produce 3D representations (point clouds, depth maps, etc.) from single-view images.

Result: Two datasets (COCO-3D, Objects365-v2-3D) were released, and experiments showed the generated data benefits various 3D tasks.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively reduces data collection costs and advances spatial intelligence, enabling AI systems to better perceive and interact with physical environments.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLF introduces a fast, scalable volumetric representation for sensor simulation, supporting both rasterization and raytracing, with applications in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity sensor simulation is crucial for autonomy testing, but existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS are slow or limited in sensor compatibility.

Method: SaLF uses sparse 3D voxel primitives with local implicit fields, enabling fast training (<30 min) and rendering (50+ FPS for cameras, 600+ FPS for LiDARs).

Result: SaLF matches realism of existing methods while improving efficiency and supporting non-pinhole cameras and LiDARs.

Conclusion: SaLF enhances scalability and versatility in sensor simulation for autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

TL;DR: The paper introduces advancements in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese notations, reducing error rates and outperforming human transcribers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of high class imbalance and limited training data in OMR for historical Chinese notations like suzipu and lülüpu.

Method: Development of a character recognition model for imbalanced data, using temperature scaling and leave-one-edition-out cross-validation.

Result: Reduced CER from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu and achieved 0.9% for lülüpu, outperforming human transcribers (15.9% average CER).

Conclusion: The work advances digitization of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural diversity and expanding OMR applicability.

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAR-Text, a large-scale SAR image-text dataset, and SAR-Narrator, a framework for generating textual descriptions. It demonstrates improved performance in vision-language tasks using SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders semantic understanding in remote sensing.

Method: Construct SAR-Text dataset using SAR-Narrator framework and evaluate on image-text retrieval, captioning, and VQA tasks with SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT models.

Result: Notable improvements in retrieval (16.43% and 10.54% recall boosts), captioning (8x, 4x, 10x higher scores), and VQA (outperforms baselines).

Conclusion: SAR-Text and SAR-Narrator advance SAR semantic understanding and can be adopted for larger datasets.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

*Yifan Liu,Shengjun Zhang,Chensheng Dai,Yang Chen,Hao Liu,Chen Li,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human Gaussian Graph to model connections between 3D Gaussians and human SMPL mesh for animatable avatars, improving frame relations and animation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict Gaussians per frame independently, missing inter-frame relations. The goal is to leverage all frames for better animatable human representations.

Method: Proposes a dual-layer Human Gaussian Graph: Gaussians as first-layer nodes and mesh vertices as second-layer nodes. Uses intra-node and inter-node operations for aggregation and message passing.

Result: Demonstrates efficiency and generalization in novel view synthesis and novel pose animation.

Conclusion: The Human Gaussian Graph effectively captures relations across frames, enabling high-quality animatable human avatars.

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised method for predicting drivable free-space corridors using monocular camera input, leveraging future ego trajectories and introducing a diffusion-based architecture (ContourDiff) for structured predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume BEV-centric representations, which are hard to obtain, and lack data for free-space corridor segments in images. The goal is to estimate navigable subsets of road regions using only monocular input.

Method: A self-supervised approach generates free-space samples using future ego trajectories and front-view images. ContourDiff, a diffusion-based architecture, denoises contour points instead of binary masks for structured predictions.

Result: The method is evaluated on nuScenes and CARLA, showing accurate prediction of safe, multimodal navigable corridors in images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of drivable free-space corridor prediction using monocular input, offering structured and interpretable results.

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

TL;DR: The paper details an iterative development of image captioning models, from CNN-LSTM to an advanced attention-based system (Nexus), highlighting the importance of attention mechanisms for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore and validate the architectural principles behind modern image captioning models, emphasizing the role of attention mechanisms.

Method: Developed five models, starting with a simple CNN-LSTM and ending with Nexus (EfficientNetV2B3 backbone + dynamic attention), tested on MS COCO 2017.

Result: Nexus achieved a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, outperforming benchmarks and showing that attention is critical for performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a replicable blueprint for understanding core architectural principles in vision-language tasks, validating the shift to attention-based models.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

*Benjamin Carter,Nathan Dilla,Micheal Callahan,Atuhaire Ambala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deepfake detection method using facial landmarks instead of raw image processing, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated media from genuine content necessitates new detection methods.

Method: Extracts facial landmarks to identify inconsistencies in facial movements, testing the approach on RNN, ANN, and CNN models.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 96% (RNN), 93% (ANN), and 78% (CNN), demonstrating effectiveness with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Facial landmark-based detection is a viable alternative to raw image processing for deepfake identification.

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Motivation: To address the limitations of low-rank parameterization in previous methods and improve efficiency in sampling for generative segmentation models.

Method: Introduces Flow-SSN, featuring discrete-time autoregressive and continuous-time flow variants, focusing on learning the base distribution for an expressive prior.

Result: Flow-SSNs estimate high-rank pixel-wise covariances without rank assumptions or storing parameters, outperforming diffusion-based models in efficiency and achieving state-of-the-art results in medical imaging.

Conclusion: Flow-SSNs offer a superior approach to generative segmentation, combining efficiency, flexibility, and high performance in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a
generative segmentation model family featuring discrete-time autoregressive and
modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

TL;DR: PTCMIL introduces a Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation, improving WSI analysis by dynamically aligning clustering with tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods struggle with WSI complexity and heterogeneity, lacking efficient aggregation and task-specific adaptability.

Method: PTCMIL integrates learnable prompt tokens into ViT, unifying clustering and prediction end-to-end, with projection-based clustering and token merging.

Result: PTCMIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and survival analysis across eight datasets, with proven robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: PTCMIL effectively addresses WSI analysis challenges, offering superior performance and interpretability, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

TL;DR: A novel phoneme-based two-stage V-ASR framework fuses visual and landmark features, followed by LLM word reconstruction, achieving lower WER on LRS2 and LRS3 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high error rates and viseme ambiguity in existing V-ASR methods by leveraging phoneme prediction and LLM-based word reconstruction.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 predicts phonemes using visual and landmark features; Stage 2 reconstructs words using an LLM (NLLB).

Result: Achieves 17.4% WER on LRS2 and 21.0% WER on LRS3, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PV-ASR method effectively reduces error rates and handles viseme ambiguity, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Adv is a new adversarial attack framework for point clouds that enhances transferability and undefendability by perturbing medial axis transform (MAT) representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on point clouds lack transferability and robustness against defenses, limiting their practical use.

Method: MAT-Adv uses an autoencoder to project point clouds into MAT representations, perturbing them to introduce structural-level adversarial characteristics. A dropout strategy is added to improve transferability and undefendability.

Result: MAT-Adv outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transferability and undefendability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances adversarial attacks on point clouds by leveraging intrinsic geometric structures, making it more effective across models and defenses.

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: Existing 2D floorplan localization methods struggle with visual changes and occlusions caused by 3D objects, prompting the need for 3D geometric priors to bridge modal gaps.

Method: The method models 3D geometric priors using multi-view constraints and view-scene aligned geometric priors via self-supervised contrastive learning, avoiding additional annotations.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing FLoc accuracy without increasing computational burden.

Conclusion: Injecting 3D geometric priors into FLoc algorithms effectively addresses modal and geometric challenges, improving localization success in realistic scenes.

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

*Zhihao Luo,Luojun Lin,Zheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD) to address limited real-world data by leveraging synthetic datasets and unannotated real images, proposing the CSRDA framework for domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD) due to high labeling costs, especially for specialized categories, necessitate leveraging synthetic data without degrading model performance.

Method: Proposes the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA), a student-teacher model using pseudo labeling and consistency regularization to bridge synthetic and real domains.

Result: CSRDA effectively mitigates data scarcity and annotation limitations in COD, demonstrating improved performance in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The CSRDA framework successfully addresses the challenge of limited real-world data in COD by combining synthetic and real datasets, enhancing model adaptability.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HQ-SMem improves Video Object Segmentation (VOS) by refining masks, optimizing memory, and updating appearance models, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOS models struggle with precise mask delineation, deformable objects, tracking drift, and long sequences. HQ-SMem aims to address these limitations.

Method: HQ-SMem combines SAM-HQ for mask refinement, a dynamic smart memory mechanism, and dynamic appearance model updates to enhance VOS performance.

Result: HQ-SMem ranks top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets and sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS.

Conclusion: HQ-SMem effectively addresses key VOS challenges, demonstrating superior performance in complex and long-term video scenarios.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

*Zhentao Huang,Di Wu,Zhenbang He,Minglun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSSR improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by ensuring even Gaussian distribution and alignment with surface normals, enhancing geometric accuracy and scene editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like 3DGS and PGSR fail to optimize Gaussian placement, leading to uneven distributions and poor geometry reconstruction.

Method: GSSR combines pixel-level and Gaussian-level normal consistency, photometric consistency, opacity regularization, and periodic reinitialization for better Gaussian alignment.

Result: GSSR achieves superior geometric precision, enabling intuitive scene editing and high-quality rendering.

Conclusion: GSSR advances Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction with improved accuracy and usability.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WiSE-OD, a method to enhance object detection in IR imagery by combining RGB and IR model weights, and proposes two OOD benchmarks for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the robustness gap in IR object detection caused by reliance on RGB pre-trained models and the modality gap between RGB and IR.

Method: Proposes WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants (WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$ and WiSE-OD$_{LP}$), and introduces LLVIP-C and FLIR-C benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: WiSE-OD improves cross-modality and corruption robustness without extra training or inference costs.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages complementary knowledge from RGB and IR models, enhancing robustness in IR object detection.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

TL;DR: A novel multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT) enhances sticker emotion recognition by fusing multi-view textual context with visual features, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sticker emotion understanding is challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information like background knowledge and stylistic cues, which existing visual models struggle with.

Method: Uses Multimodal Large Language Models for multi-view textual context, a hierarchical fusion strategy with a pyramid visual transformer, and contrastive learning to integrate text and visual features.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over existing methods (5.4% F1, 4.0% accuracy) on public sticker emotion datasets.

Conclusion: MGHFT effectively integrates multi-view textual and visual information for superior sticker emotion recognition.

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

*Jionghao Wang,Cheng Lin,Yuan Liu,Rui Xu,Zhiyang Dou,Xiao-Xiao Long,Hao-Xiang Guo,Taku Komura,Wenping Wang,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDT is a framework using diffusion models to transform unstructured point clouds into semantically meaningful distributions, capturing geometric and semantic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured information from unstructured point clouds is under-explored, limiting their semantic utility.

Method: PDT employs diffusion models with novel architecture and learning strategies to correlate source and target distributions via denoising.

Result: The method successfully transforms point clouds into structured outputs like keypoints, joints, and feature lines.

Conclusion: PDT offers a powerful tool for 3D geometry processing by generating structured point distributions.

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

TL;DR: The paper proposes OASIS, a lightweight method for semi-supervised video object segmentation, improving accuracy and handling occlusion with boundary refinement and evidential learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in occlusion and object interactions in SVOS, while meeting real-time processing needs.

Method: Uses a structure refinement module with Canny filter edge priors and evidential learning for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Achieves superior performance (91.6 F on DAVIS-17, 86.6 G on YouTubeVOS) and 48 FPS speed.

Conclusion: OASIS is efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6
(vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive
speed of 48 FPS on DAVIS.

Motivation: Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated datasets for automated diagnosis of apical periodontitis.

Method: Proposes PerioDet, incorporating Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) to handle noise and small targets.

Result: PerioDet outperforms on the PerioXrays dataset, demonstrating clinical applicability in human-computer experiments.

Conclusion: The PerioXrays dataset and PerioDet method advance automated apical periodontitis detection, showing promise for clinical use.

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

Conclusion: MVI is essential for usable models in complex datasets. Smaller YOLO variants offer efficiency benefits, providing a robust baseline for real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required

around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge

under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average

TL;DR: AEDR is a training-free method for tracing image origins in generative models, improving accuracy and efficiency over existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security concerns from photorealistic image generation by accurately attributing images to their source models.

Method: AEDR uses double-reconstruction with autoencoders and a loss ratio, calibrated by image homogeneity, for attribution.

Result: AEDR outperforms existing methods by 25.5% in accuracy and reduces computational time to 1%.

Conclusion: AEDR offers a highly efficient and accurate solution for image attribution in generative models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified point-level prompting method to enhance noisy and incomplete point clouds for robust downstream analysis, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud enhancement methods are isolated from downstream tasks and struggle with conflicting objectives, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Introduces a Rectification Prompter for noise filtering and a Completion Prompter for robustness, unified by a Shape-Aware Unit module.

Result: Demonstrates superiority on four datasets for handling noisy and incomplete point clouds.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively unifies enhancement and analysis, improving robustness and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

TL;DR: GPSMamba combines adaptive semantic-frequency prompts and thermal-spectral attention to enhance infrared image super-resolution, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared images suffer from low contrast and sparse textures, requiring robust long-range modeling for global coherence. Existing methods like Mamba fragment 2D context, limiting detail restoration.

Method: Proposes GPSMamba with an Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) for non-local context and Thermal-Spectral Attention with Phase Consistency Loss for global supervision.

Result: GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in infrared image restoration.

Conclusion: GPSMamba effectively addresses causal modeling limitations, offering a powerful paradigm for infrared image super-resolution.

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

TL;DR: MedIQA is a foundation model for medical image quality assessment (IQA) that outperforms existing methods by handling diverse modalities and clinical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical IQA methods lack generalization across modalities and scenarios, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Developed MedIQA with a large multi-modality dataset, salient slice assessment, and automatic prompt strategy for alignment.

Result: MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MedIQA provides a scalable framework for medical IQA, improving diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: Rapid advances in medical imaging technology underscore the critical need for
precise and automated image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure diagnostic
accuracy. Existing medical IQA methods, however, struggle to generalize across
diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA,
the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle
variability in image dimensions, modalities, anatomical regions, and types. We
developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually
annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice
assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval
and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical
parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA
and advancing diagnostic workflows and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: The paper reviews hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposing a taxonomy, evaluating benchmarks, and summarizing detection methods, while identifying limitations and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce hallucinated content that contradicts input or facts, necessitating a systematic review of evaluation benchmarks and detection methods.

Method: The paper proposes a hallucination taxonomy, reviews benchmarks for T2I and I2T tasks, and summarizes detection methods.

Result: Highlights limitations in current benchmarks and detection methods, suggesting areas for improvement.

Conclusion: Future research should address identified limitations to enhance hallucination evaluation and detection in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

TL;DR: GR-CLIP, a lightweight calibration method, addresses the modality gap in CLIP's embedding space, improving mixed modality search performance by up to 26 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed modality search (across images, texts, and multimodal documents) is important but underexplored, with existing models like CLIP showing limitations due to a modality gap.

Method: Proposes GR-CLIP, a post-hoc calibration method to remove the modality gap in CLIP's embedding space.

Result: GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points over CLIP and outperforms recent models by 4 percentage points with 75x less compute.

Conclusion: GR-CLIP effectively addresses the modality gap, enhancing mixed modality search performance efficiently.

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

### [79] [A New One-Shot Federated Learning Framework for Medical Imaging Classification with Feature-Guided Rectified Flow and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19045)
*Yufei Ma,Hanwen Zhang,Qiya Yang,Guibo Luo,Yuesheng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modified OSFL framework with FG-RF and DLKD improves efficiency, privacy, and performance in non-IID medical imaging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSFL methods in healthcare face low efficiency, privacy risks, and challenges with non-IID data.

Method: Proposes FG-RF for feature-level image synthesis and DLKD for dual-layer knowledge distillation during aggregation.

Result: Outperforms multi-round FL by 21.73% and FedISCA by 21.75%, with reduced privacy risks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses efficiency, privacy, and non-IID challenges in OSFL for medical imaging.

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores brain encoding models using advanced visual and auditory feature extractors, highlighting a trade-off between model complexity and generalization, with simpler models performing better on out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli and test the generalization of encoding models to novel contexts.

Method: Developed brain encoding models using X-CLIP (visual) and Whisper (auditory) feature extractors, evaluated on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

Result: A simpler linear model outperformed a higher-capacity attention-based model on OOD data by 18%, with linguistic features not improving accuracy. Performance gains were notable in the auditory cortex.

Conclusion: Rigorous OOD testing is crucial for robust neuro-AI models, and model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory hierarchies significantly influence neural encoding.

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenePainter addresses semantic drift in perpetual 3D scene generation by aligning scene-specific priors with current scene comprehension using a hierarchical graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene generation suffer from semantic drift due to accumulated deviations in outpainting, limiting coherence in long-range view sequences.

Method: Proposes ScenePainter, which uses a SceneConceptGraph to hierarchically relate multi-level scene concepts, guiding consistent novel view generation and dynamic refinement.

Result: Overcomes semantic drift, producing more consistent and immersive 3D view sequences.

Conclusion: ScenePainter enhances semantic consistency and diversity in perpetual 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

*Xiaocheng Fang,Jieyi Cai,Huanyu Liu,Wenxiu Cai,Yishu Liu,Bingzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NRQO, a novel paradigm combining NT-FPN and PS-RPN to improve small object detection by addressing noise sensitivity and poor query quality in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based detectors for small object detection struggle with noise sensitivity in FPN and low-quality queries due to label assignment strategies.

Method: Proposes NRQO with NT-FPN for noise-resilient feature fusion and PS-RPN for high-quality query generation via anchor-ground truth matching.

Result: NRQO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: NRQO effectively addresses key challenges in small object detection, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [83] [Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19064)
*Haochen Han,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Fangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of negation understanding in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proposing a low-resource method called NEAT to adapt models during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like medical imaging require models to handle negation, but VLMs struggle with this due to lack of training data. Existing solutions are resource-intensive.

Method: The paper introduces NEAT, a Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation method, which adjusts distribution-related parameters during inference to address dual-concept shifts between affirmation and negation.

Result: Experiments on negation tasks show NEAT effectively reduces distribution shifts and improves performance.

Conclusion: NEAT offers a sustainable, low-resource solution for negation understanding in VLMs, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework to improve cross-subject fMRI decoding by addressing sequential errors and enhancing semantic and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in cross-subject mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences, leading to error accumulation in reconstructions.

Method: Introduces a Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework with Subject Bias Modulation, Semantic Refinement, and Visual Coherence Modules, integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, with strong adaptability to new subjects.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses cross-subject challenges and improves reconstruction fidelity, demonstrating adaptability and superior performance.

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

TL;DR: LOTUS is a leaderboard for evaluating detailed image captions by LVLMs, addressing gaps like lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments, and user preference considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for detailed captions lack standardized criteria, bias awareness, and user preference alignment.

Method: LOTUS evaluates caption quality, risks (e.g., hallucination), societal biases (e.g., gender bias), and tailors criteria to user preferences.

Result: No single LVLM excels across all criteria; caption detail correlates with bias risks. User priorities determine optimal model selection.

Conclusion: LOTUS provides a comprehensive, preference-aware framework for evaluating detailed captions, highlighting trade-offs in model performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of CNNs (long-range dependencies) and transformers (computational complexity) in medical anomaly detection by exploiting the inherent structural regularity of medical images.

Method: Proposes SP-Mamba with window-sliding prototype learning and Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba to exploit anatomical patterns and spatial information. Also utilizes anomaly map characteristics for detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three medical anomaly detection benchmarks, demonstrating efficacy and robustness.

Conclusion: SP-Mamba is a promising alternative for medical anomaly detection, validated by superior performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.

Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for GUI automation agents and the underexplored dimension of task efficiency in GUI automation.

Method: Develops MMBench-GUI with four levels (GUI Content Understanding, Element Grounding, Task Automation, Task Collaboration) and proposes the EQA metric for efficiency assessment.

Result: Identifies visual grounding as critical for task success and highlights inefficiencies in current models, emphasizing the need for precise localization, planning, and early stopping.

Conclusion: MMBench-GUI provides a robust framework for evaluating GUI agents, with modular frameworks and efficiency strategies being key to scalable automation.

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

TL;DR: FGMoE introduces a Fine-Grained Mixture of Experts architecture for multi-task learning, combining intra-task, shared, and global experts to balance specialization and shared knowledge, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in balancing shared representations and task-specific specialization in multi-task learning for dense prediction tasks.

Method: Proposes FGMoE with intra-task experts for finer decomposition, shared experts for common information, and a global expert for adaptive knowledge transfer, plus fine-tuning for efficiency.

Result: FGMoE outperforms current MoE-based MTL models on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FGMoE effectively balances specialization and shared knowledge, improving performance and parameter efficiency in dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate predictions and well-calibrated uncertainty in medical imaging, crucial for clinical decision-making.

Method: Uses Symmetrical Flow Matching to unify classification, generation, and uncertainty quantification, with a latent-space formulation and semantic mask conditioning.

Result: Matches or outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC on MedMNIST datasets, with validated uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow effectively integrates classification and uncertainty quantification, proving valuable for high-stakes medical applications.

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LISA is a plug-and-play method for MLLMs that reduces object hallucinations by modulating and fusing layer-wise features, improving generation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often hallucinate objects not present in images, degrading performance in vision-language tasks.

Method: LISA uses layer-wise spectral modulation and token-level logit fusion to stabilize attention and integrate features adaptively.

Result: LISA reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6% and improves POPE F1 by 4.5%, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: LISA effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs while maintaining compatibility with existing models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

Result: Achieves 90.99% mAP on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, with 12.5 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: CSTF enhances cross-modal feature matching, directly improving downstream applications like object detection.

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

### [92] [PatchTraj: Dynamic Patch Representation Learning for Time-Frequency Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19119)
*Yanghong Liu,Xingping Dong,Ming Li,Weixing Zhang,Yidong Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchTraj is a dynamic patch-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction, unifying time and frequency domains to improve motion modeling and long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately model human motion dynamics and lack frequency-domain interaction in time representation.

Method: Decomposes trajectories into time and frequency components, uses dynamic patch partitioning, adaptive embedding, hierarchical feature aggregation, and cross-modal attention for fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets.

Conclusion: PatchTraj effectively balances local details and long-range dependencies, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

*Kaiyue Zhou,Zelong Tan,Hongxiao Wang,Ya-li Li,Shengjin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopGeoFormer is an end-to-end architecture for point cloud recovery, combining topological and geometric features through InterTwining Attention and optimized losses for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively leverage both topological and geometric attributes in point cloud recovery.

Method: Proposes TopGeoFormer with topological embedding, InterTwining Attention, and geometry/topological loss functions.

Result: Outperforms existing sampling and recovery methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer successfully integrates topological and geometric features, achieving state-of-the-art performance in point cloud recovery.

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

*Weitian Wang,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixA-Q is a mixed-precision activation quantization framework for efficient inference in window-based vision transformers, leveraging intra-layer activation sparsity to balance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the trade-off between model performance and efficiency in quantized vision transformers by exploiting activation sparsity.

Method: MixA-Q separates batched window computations, assigns lower bit widths to less important windows, and introduces a Two-Branch Swin Block for mixed-precision processing.

Result: Achieves 1.35x speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ, 1.25x speedup in QAT, and 1.53x speedup with minimal mAP drop. Also improves mAP by 0.7% in W4A4 models.

Conclusion: MixA-Q effectively enhances efficiency and performance in quantized vision transformers by leveraging sparsity-aware quantization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAHNet balances conservative prototype learning and aggressive affinity learning for few-shot segmentation, improving accuracy via hybrid modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the imbalance between conservative predictions of prototype learning and aggressive predictions of affinity learning in few-shot segmentation.

Method: Proposes PAHNet with Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) and Attention Score Calibration (ASC) modules to integrate and balance the two learning paradigms.

Result: PAHNet outperforms recent methods on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets in 1-shot and 5-shot settings.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively mitigates aggressiveness in affinity learning, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

*Jie Chen,Zhangchi Hu,Peixi Wu,Huyue Zhu,Hebei Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DASH is a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework using 4D hash encoding and self-supervised decomposition to improve rendering quality and avoid low-rank assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from feature overlap, poor rendering quality, and hash collisions due to unsuitable assumptions.

Method: DASH employs self-supervised decomposition, multiresolution 4D hash encoding for dynamics, and spatio-temporal smoothness regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 264 FPS on a single GPU, enhancing visual quality.

Conclusion: DASH effectively addresses challenges in dynamic scene reconstruction, offering high-quality real-time rendering.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

### [97] [Patch Pruning Strategy Based on Robust Statistical Measures of Attention Weight Diversity in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19175)
*Yuki Igaue,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A patch pruning strategy for vision transformers evaluates patch importance using variance of attention weights across heads, improving efficiency without losing accuracy. Robust measures like median absolute deviation also work well. Overlapping patch embeddings further enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-head self-attention in vision transformers has quadratic computational complexity. Patch pruning addresses this by removing redundant patches, improving efficiency.

Method: Proposes evaluating patch importance via variance of attention weights across heads. Uses robust measures like median absolute deviation and introduces overlapping patch embeddings.

Result: Achieves improved throughput while maintaining classification accuracy, especially in fine-tuning scenarios. Overlapping embeddings boost performance with comparable throughput.

Conclusion: The method efficiently reduces computational cost without sacrificing accuracy, leveraging robust measures and overlapping embeddings for better performance.

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

TL;DR: A unified framework for image restoration across multiple weather conditions (fog, snow, rain) using continual learning, selective kernel fusion, EWC, and cycle-contrastive loss, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single weather conditions, but autonomous driving needs a unified model for diverse weather restoration.

Method: Proposes continual learning with selective kernel fusion, EWC, and cycle-contrastive loss for unpaired image restoration.

Result: Significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality on benchmark datasets for dehazing, desnowing, and deraining.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unifies restoration tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisHall3D is a two-stage framework for monocular semantic scene completion, addressing feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency by separating visible region reconstruction and invisible region inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, limiting scene completion accuracy.

Method: VisHall3D uses VisFrontierNet for visible region reconstruction and OcclusionMAE for invisible region hallucination, with noise injection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks.

Conclusion: VisHall3D improves reconstruction quality and advances scene understanding for applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

*Xiaoyu Zhang,Zhifeng Bao,Hai Dong,Ziwei Wang,Jiajun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CounterNet improves object counting accuracy in 3D point clouds, enhancing query reliability for autonomous vehicle data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 2D video data fail in 3D point clouds, leading to unreliable object counts and query results.

Method: Proposes CounterNet, a heatmap-based network with feature map partitioning and dynamic model selection for accurate counting.

Result: Improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CounterNet enables more reliable query outcomes for autonomous vehicle analytics.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPA-ADV, a dataset for subjective personalized attention in ads, and PRE-MAP, a reinforcement learning-based saliency model, addressing gaps in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models ignore subjective cognitive diversity in fixation behavior, and current saliency prediction methods lack personalization and precision.

Method: Proposes PRE-MAP, a reinforcement learning-optimized eye-tracking model, and C-GRPO for accurate point predictions, using a large-scale dataset (SPA-ADV).

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on SPA-ADV and benchmarks, improving personalized attention prediction.

Conclusion: The approach advances personalized saliency modeling and addresses limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of holistic reasoning in multi-human and human-scene interactions for dynamic scene generation.

Method: Uses an event generator to break scenes into sequential events, synthesizes motions based on spatial guidance, and employs a high-level module for scalable context translation.

Result: Benchmark results and user studies confirm the framework's effectiveness in capturing scene context with high scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generates diverse and scalable multi-human contextual motions, supported by a new benchmark.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

Motivation: Address limitations of single-vehicle autonomous systems by enabling multi-agent information exchange, focusing on understudied sequential perception tasks like cooperative tracking.

Method: Features Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction and Cross-Agent Association and Aggregation, leveraging a feature graph for adaptive fusion.

Result: Achieves 39.0% mAP and 32.8% AMOTA on V2X-Seq, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CoopTrack advances cooperative perception with efficient, high-performance tracking, validated on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multimodal anomaly detection framework for 3D depth anomalies using disentangled depth and appearance representation, enabling richer anomaly generation and outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios and lack sufficient abnormal samples, necessitating a novel approach.

Method: Extracts visible depth from 3D point clouds and uses 2D RGB images for appearance, with anomaly generators for RGB and depth, and shared parameter modules.

Result: Outperforms SOTA on MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges 2D and 3D anomaly detection, leveraging multimodal features without complex fusion.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

TL;DR: OV-Fact is a novel method for evaluating factuality in long captions without human annotations, improving agreement with human judgments and enabling data filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs struggle with factual long captions, and traditional metrics fail in diverse or annotation-free settings.

Method: Uses open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based verification for reference-free factuality measurement.

Result: Improves factuality precision without losing descriptiveness, even with smaller, filtered datasets.

Conclusion: OV-Fact enables better caption evaluation and data filtering, enhancing VLM performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

TL;DR: SimMLM is a simple, effective framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities, using a dynamic gating mechanism and a novel ranking loss to ensure accuracy improves with more modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling missing modalities are complex or rely on imputation. SimMLM aims to provide a simpler, more robust solution.

Method: SimMLM uses a Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) with a learnable gating mechanism and introduces the More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss to align accuracy with modality availability.

Result: SimMLM outperforms existing methods in medical image segmentation and multimodal classification tasks, showing better accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: SimMLM offers a generic, effective solution for multimodal learning with missing modalities, validated by superior performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

*Marcel Simon,Tae-Ho Kim,Seul-Ki Yeom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A video-distilled single-image encoder is introduced to predict next-frame representations, improving mIoU on ADE20K without complex temporal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SSL methods ignore temporal cues in videos, limiting their ability to learn robust visual features.

Method: The approach trains a single-image encoder to predict next-frame representations, leveraging 3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking.

Result: Pre-training on a 2-hour video improves mIoU on ADE20K from 35.0 to 36.4, maintaining compatibility with image-only pipelines.

Conclusion: Video self-distillation is a lightweight way to achieve geometry-aware perception, useful for Physical AI and world models.

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

*Liang Yao,Fan Liu,Hongbo Lu,Chuanyi Zhang,Rui Min,Shengxiang Xu,Shimin Di,Pai Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RemoteReasoner, a flexible workflow for remote sensing tasks, integrating a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for autonomous reasoning and diverse output generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing data requires advanced reasoning to interpret complex user intents and contextual relationships, which existing supervised methods fail to address.

Method: RemoteReasoner combines an MLLM for instruction interpretation and target localization with task adaptation strategies, trained via reinforcement learning for autonomy.

Result: The framework achieves strong performance in multi-granularity reasoning tasks (region-level, pixel-level) and enables novel capabilities like contour extraction.

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner offers a unified, flexible solution for remote sensing reasoning, outperforming existing methods and expanding task possibilities.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

*Sakuya Ota,Qing Yu,Kent Fujiwara,Satoshi Ikehata,Ikuro Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PINO is a training-free framework for generating realistic group interactions by decomposing them into pairwise interactions and using physics-based penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on shared prompts, limiting nuanced control and simplifying interactions.

Method: PINO decomposes group interactions into pairwise ones, uses pretrained two-person models, and applies physics-based penalties.

Result: PINO generates realistic, physically coherent, and customizable multi-person interactions.

Conclusion: PINO is effective for diverse applications like animation, gaming, and robotics.

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automatic blood cell detection method (ABCD) using an improved YOLOX model, enhancing feature extraction and fusion, and achieving higher accuracy and speed than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual blood cell detection is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated, efficient solution using deep learning.

Method: The method integrates CBAM for feature extraction, ASFF for feature fusion, and replaces IOU with CIOU loss for faster convergence.

Result: ABCD achieved 95.49% mAP@0.5 and 86.89% mAP@0.5-0.9, outperforming baseline methods by 2.8% and 23.41%, respectively, with a 2.9% speed increase.

Conclusion: The proposed ABCD method is highly effective for real-time blood cell detection, offering improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network for fusing LiDAR and RGB data to improve outdoor 3D object detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor 3D object detection faces challenges in integrating LiDAR and RGB data effectively, which the paper aims to address.

Method: The MuStD network uses a three-stream structure: LiDAR-PillarNet for sparse 2D pillar features, LiDAR-Height Compression for Bird's-Eye View features, and a 3D Multimodal stream combining RGB and LiDAR features.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results on the KITTI Object Detection Benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed MuStD network effectively fuses LiDAR and RGB data for accurate 3D object detection, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDE improves interpretability of prototypical models by enforcing sparsity, reducing explanation size by 90% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks lack transparency in high-stakes domains like medical imaging and autonomous driving, needing clearer explanations.

Method: SIDE uses a training and pruning scheme with sigmoid activations to enforce sparsity, associating each class with fewer prototypes.

Result: SIDE matches existing methods' accuracy while reducing explanation size by over 90%.

Conclusion: SIDE enhances prototype-based explanations' understandability without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

TL;DR: EffiComm reduces data transmission in collaborative perception by 60% while maintaining high 3D object detection accuracy using selective transmission and adaptive grid reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming latency and scalability issues in V2V communication caused by transmitting raw data.

Method: Two-stage reduction pipeline: Selective Transmission (ST) and Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) with a GNN, followed by soft-gated MoE attention for feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 0.84 mAP@0.7 with ~1.5 MB per frame, outperforming prior methods on accuracy-per-bit.

Conclusion: EffiComm demonstrates adaptive, learned communication is valuable for scalable V2X perception.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

TL;DR: A novel approach for semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation integrates fine-grained and global semantic information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in realism and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gesture generation research focuses on rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting semantic context, which this paper addresses.

Method: Uses a vector-quantized variational autoencoder for motion prior, followed by a module generating gestures from speech, text semantics, and speaker identity, ensuring semantic coherence.

Result: Enhances realism and coherence of semantic gestures, outperforming benchmarks in objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates semantic grounding, improving gesture generation quality.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

TL;DR: EA-ViT is a framework for adapting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to diverse resource constraints without retraining multiple models, using a nested elastic architecture and a lightweight router.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying ViTs for varying resource constraints typically requires retraining multiple models, which is inefficient. EA-ViT aims to streamline this process.

Method: 1. Enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture for structural flexibility. 2. Use a curriculum-based training strategy for stable adaptation. 3. Design a lightweight router to select submodels based on computational budgets and task demands.

Result: EA-ViT effectively generates adaptable models for diverse constraints, validated by extensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: EA-ViT offers an efficient and versatile solution for deploying ViTs across varying resource constraints, reducing the need for multiple retraining.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

Motivation: Enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction in autonomous driving through interpretable scene descriptions.

Method: BEV-LLM uses BEVFusion to merge 3D LiDAR and multi-view images, with a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific descriptions.

Result: Achieves competitive performance (up to 5% higher BLEU scores) on nuCaption and introduces nuView and GroundView datasets for better evaluation.

Conclusion: BEV-LLM advances scene captioning for autonomous driving, supported by new datasets addressing benchmark gaps.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper addresses class imbalance in CXR diagnosis using a class-weighting mechanism with GMM clustering and Student t-distribution, improving zero-shot AUC by 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in CXR datasets challenges self-supervised models, especially for long-tailed classes, reducing CLIP's effectiveness.

Method: Uses GMM clustering on latent space, refined by Student t-distribution and metric loss, to align class distribution and improve rare class recognition.

Result: Achieves 7% average improvement in zero-shot AUC scores on MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances classification performance, particularly for rare classes, outperforming SOTA models.

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

TL;DR: MAELRE is a unified transformer architecture for efficient long-range encoding across modalities, combining token merging and attention approximation to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in long-context processing on single devices, aiming for a modality-agnostic solution.

Method: Proposes MAELRE, integrating token merging and attention approximation, switching between lightweight and standard attention based on token count.

Result: Outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency across text, time series, audio, and vision tasks.

Conclusion: MAELRE offers a scalable, efficient solution for long-context processing without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

Motivation: Existing BIQA methods lack sufficient integration and flexible uncertainty estimation, leading to suboptimal results.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and robustness on synthetic and authentic distortion datasets, with strong generalization to unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: DEFNet outperforms existing methods by enhancing information richness and uncertainty estimation, proving adaptable and reliable.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal visual semantics, which remain poorly explored.

Method: A systematic framework with three circuits: visual auditing, semantic tracing, and attention flow, applied to analyze LVLMs.

Result: Visual semantics are localized to specific object tokens (removal degrades performance by 92.6%), and interpretable concepts refine in middle-to-late layers.

Conclusion: The findings provide mechanistic insights for spatiotemporal semantics in LVLMs, aiding the design of more robust and interpretable models.

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

Motivation: Existing LiDAR-based occupancy methods lack scalability and limit the use of crowdsourced data. Vision-only approaches face challenges like incomplete geometry and post-processing needs.

Method: GS-Occ3D uses an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation for explicit occupancy representation, decomposing scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects for tailored modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction on Waymo dataset and shows superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D demonstrates the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

### [122] [Fast Learning of Non-Cooperative Spacecraft 3D Models through Primitive Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19459)
*Pol Francesch Huc,Emily Bates,Simone D'Amico*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CNN-based pipeline reduces training iterations and input images for 3DGS by initializing with coarse 3D models, even with noisy or implicit poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of NeRF and 3DGS (pose dependency and high computational cost) for space applications.

Method: Uses a CNN to initialize 3DGS with coarse 3D models and pose estimates, reducing training needs.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity 3D representations with imperfect poses, reducing training iterations by an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: Enables novel view synthesis in space applications despite pose and computational constraints.

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

Conclusion: DINO-world's action-conditioned version enables planning via latent space trajectory simulation, showcasing broad applicability.

Abstract: We present DINO-world, a powerful generalist video world model trained to

pre-trained image encoder and training a future predictor on a large-scale
uncurated video dataset, DINO-world learns the temporal dynamics of diverse
scenes, from driving and indoor scenes to simulated environments. We show that

that enriches DINO features into Enhanced DINO ones (EDINO) to capture
hierarchical scene elements and their structural relationships. Building upon
it, we propose two foundational paradigms for NeRF and 3DGS SLAM systems
integrating EDINO features. Our DINO-informed pipelines achieve superior

*Byungjun Kim,Shunsuke Saito,Giljoo Nam,Tomas Simon,Jason Saragih,Hanbyul Joo,Junxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit face-hair compositionality, enabling flexible swapping and few-shot fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing holistic models struggle with disentangling face and hair representations and lack flexibility for applications like swapping.

Method: Separate latent spaces for face and hair, using synthetic hairless data from a diffusion prior. Trained on paired hair/hairless datasets.

Result: Enables seamless face/hair transfer and few-shot fine-tuning for high-fidelity avatars.

Conclusion: The model's compositionality and flexibility advance practical 3D avatar generation.

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

### [127] [People Are Highly Cooperative with Large Language Models, Especially When Communication Is Possible or Following Human Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18639)
*Paweł Niszczota,Tomasz Grzegorczyk,Alexander Pastukhov*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: LLMs in business settings show lower but still high cooperation rates compared to humans, with communication boosting cooperation equally for both. Prior human interaction also enhances cooperation with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how interacting with LLMs instead of humans affects cooperative behavior in business contexts.

Method: Used the Prisoner's Dilemma game in two experiments: repeated rounds (Experiment 1) and one-shot games with/without communication (Experiment 2).

Result: Cooperation rates with LLMs were 10-15% lower than with humans but remained high. Communication increased cooperation equally for humans and LLMs (88%). Prior human interaction boosted cooperation with LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs can be carefully used in cooperative business settings, as they foster high cooperation, especially with communication and prior human interaction.

Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment
humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for
business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder
trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human
might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's
Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic
scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round
repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).
In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or
an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling
LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation
rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points
compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This
finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost
of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about
cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the
likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is
particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the
assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines
compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher
following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in
cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by
businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: TreeReader is a novel tool that uses an interactive tree structure and LLM-generated summaries to enhance academic paper navigation and comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear formats and LLM-based chatbots often fail to effectively present hierarchical structures or reliable summaries, hindering efficient academic reading.

Method: TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree, with concise LLM-generated summaries for each section and on-demand access to details.

Result: A user study showed TreeReader improves reading efficiency and comprehension by enabling focused exploration and verification of summaries.

Conclusion: TreeReader bridges hierarchical summarization with interactive exploration, offering a more efficient way to understand complex academic literature.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for
scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause
cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it
difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer
summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may
produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's
navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic
reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented
paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure
where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise
summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users
to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and
verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to
evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension.
TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand
complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with
interactive exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess human ability to differentiate between real and AI-generated images, addressing concerns about misinformation from AI content.

Method: Used data from the 'Real or Not Quiz' game, analyzing 287,000 image evaluations by 12,500 participants to measure accuracy in identifying image authenticity.

Result: Overall success rate was 62%, with higher accuracy for portraits but significant difficulty with landscapes.

Conclusion: Humans find it challenging to detect AI-generated images, especially landscapes, underscoring the need for tools like watermarks and AI detection to combat misinformation.

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from
AI-generated content

### [130] [A Markov Categorical Framework for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19247)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using Markov Categories to analyze auto-regressive language models, explaining why NLL training yields versatile representations and revealing implicit spectral contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical understanding of why the NLL objective in auto-regressive models leads to powerful and versatile representations.

Method: Uses Markov Categories (MCs) to model the AR generation process and NLL objective, analyzing information flow and learned geometry.

Result: Explains the success of speculative decoding methods, formalizes NLL's role in learning intrinsic stochasticity, and proves NLL acts as implicit spectral contrastive learning.

Conclusion: The framework reveals deep structural principles behind modern language models' effectiveness.

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recent studies show LLMs are nearing superforecaster-level event forecasting, with reinforcement learning and reasoning models improving performance. This paper advocates for large-scale training of such LLMs, addressing training challenges and data acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to capitalize on recent advancements in LLMs and reinforcement learning to achieve superforecaster-level event forecasting, addressing current limitations and proposing scalable solutions.

Method: Proposes solutions for training challenges (noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, simple rewards) using Bayesian networks, counterfactual events, and auxiliary rewards. Suggests aggressive data use from markets, public sources, and crawling.

Result: Identifies potential for LLMs to reach superforecaster-level performance and outlines actionable research directions to achieve this.

Conclusion: The paper calls for research interest in large-scale training of superforecaster-level LLMs, highlighting technical advances and societal benefits.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

*Saeed Mohseni-Sehdeh,Walid Saad,Kei Sakaguchi,Tao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based framework with piecewise guidance is introduced for solving inverse problems, balancing efficiency and accuracy without requiring task-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving inverse problems efficiently and accurately using diffusion models, while avoiding the need for problem-specific retraining.

Method: The framework uses a piecewise guidance scheme, adapting approximations based on noise levels (high-noise vs. low-noise phases), and incorporates measurement noise explicitly.

Result: Achieves significant inference time reductions (25% for inpainting, 23-24% for super-resolution) with negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Conclusion: The proposed method is versatile, efficient, and effective for various inverse problems, as demonstrated in image restoration tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

TL;DR: A method to automatically identify the best neural network layer for probing human-defined concepts, validated through empirical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept probing is popular but performance depends on the layer probed, making layer selection crucial.

Method: Proposes a method to select layers based on how informative and regular their representations are for the concept.

Result: Validated through extensive empirical analysis across models and datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies optimal layers for concept probing.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA) mechanism for IR drop estimation in VLSI design, improving accuracy by adaptively balancing feature channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation-based methods for IR drop prediction are computationally expensive and lack scalability, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: The authors reformulate IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task using multi-channel physical maps and introduce WACA to enhance weak feature channels while suppressing dominant ones.

Result: The method reduces mean absolute error by 61.1% and improves F1-score by 71.0% compared to the ICCAD-2023 contest winner.

Conclusion: Channel-wise heterogeneity is crucial for accurate physical layout analysis in VLSI, and the WACA mechanism effectively addresses this.

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

*Hengran Zhang,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Jiaming Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes distilling LLMs' utility judgment capabilities into smaller models for efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), improving answer quality and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of using LLMs for utility judgments in RAG limit passage evaluation, especially for complex queries.

Method: Distill utility judgment capabilities from teacher LLMs into smaller student models, focusing on utility-based selection and dynamic passage selection.

Result: Utility-based selection outperforms relevance ranking for complex queries, reducing costs and improving answer quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a flexible, cost-effective solution for RAG, with potential for further research using released annotations.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

Motivation: Noisy retrieved passages undermine RAG effectiveness; enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for reliable RAG systems.

Method: Proposes Passage Injection, a method integrating retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning to recognize and resist noise. Validated using BM25 retriever on four LLMs and datasets.

Result: Significantly improves RAG performance and robustness in noisy settings (random and counterfactual noise). Also effectively leverages helpful passages.

Conclusion: Incorporating passages into LLMs' reasoning is promising for building robust RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

### [137] [FD-Bench: A Full-Duplex Benchmarking Pipeline Designed for Full Duplex Spoken Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19040)
*Yizhou Peng,Yi-Wen Chao,Dianwen Ng,Yukun Ma,Chongjia Ni,Bin Ma,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmarking pipeline for full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) to evaluate performance during user interruptions, using LLMs, TTS, and ASR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack metrics for full-duplex (FD) scenes, such as handling interruptions, prompting the need for a comprehensive FD evaluation framework.

Method: A benchmarking pipeline was developed using LLMs, TTS, and ASR to assess FDSDS's ability to manage interruptions, delays, and robustness. It was tested on three open-source FDSDS with simulated conversations and interruptions.

Result: All tested models struggled with interruptions, delays, and noisy conditions, highlighting ongoing challenges in FD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark addresses a critical gap in FD evaluation, revealing persistent issues in FDSDS performance under real-time interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) enable more natural human-machine
interactions by allowing real-time user interruptions and backchanneling,
compared to traditional SDS that rely on turn-taking. However, existing
benchmarks lack metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance
during user interruptions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD
benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap. It
assesses FDSDS's ability to handle user interruptions, manage delays, and
maintain robustness in challenging scenarios with diverse novel metrics. We
applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and
VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated
conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models
continue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions,
under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions. Demonstrations, data, and code
will be released.

### [138] [Should Top-Down Clustering Affect Boundaries in Unsupervised Word Discovery?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19204)
*Simon Malan,Benjamin van Niekerk,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper compares bottom-up and top-down methods for segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like units and clustering them into a lexicon, finding both achieve similar results, with bottom-up being faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if top-down information is necessary for improving speech segmentation and lexicon creation, comparing two frameworks.

Method: Two approaches: a simple bottom-up method using self-supervised features for boundary prediction, and a top-down ES-KMeans method iteratively updating boundaries.

Result: Both methods achieve state-of-the-art results on ZeroSpeech benchmarks, with bottom-up being faster. Top-down benefits depend on factors like candidate boundaries.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving clustering techniques and learning better word-like representations, as clustering is a limiting factor.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like
units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized
into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then
cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods
incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.
However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve
segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in
whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up
strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent
self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a
lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic
programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On
the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable
state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times
faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of
ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate
boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as
well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.
Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering
techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations. Project

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Automated method to amplify real-world scanned data for high-quality 3D rendering, reducing costs and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and reduced accuracy in manual creation of outdoor 3D content for realistic applications.

Method: Process to automatically amplify real-world scanned data and render in real-time 3D.

Result: Enables close-range exploration with high quality for training, simulation, gaming, and visualization.

Conclusion: Proposed method offers a cost-effective and accurate alternative to manual 3D content creation.

Abstract: Building realistic wide scale outdoor 3D content with sufficient visual
quality to observe at walking eye level or from driven vehicles is often
carried out by large teams of artists skilled in modelling, texturing, material
shading and lighting, which typically leads to both prohibitive costs and
reduced accuracy honoring the variety of real world ground truth landscapes. In
our proposed method, we define a process to automatically amplify real-world
scanned data and render real-time in animated 3D to explore at close range with
high quality for training, simulation, video game and visualisation
applications.

TL;DR: PGKET, using photonic Gaussian kernels, improves transformer efficiency for long sequences, outperforming state-of-the-art models in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention mechanisms are inefficient for long sequences, prompting the need for a more scalable solution.

Method: PGKET employs photonic Gaussian kernel self-attention, leveraging photon interferometry for parallel input processing.

Result: PGKET excels in multi-classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10, showing promise for complex tasks and photonic computing.

Conclusion: PGKET enhances transformer performance and scalability, with potential for broader applications in photonic computing.

Abstract: Self-Attention Mechanisms (SAMs) enhance model performance by extracting key
information but are inefficient when dealing with long sequences. To this end,
a photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer (PGKET) is proposed, based on
the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (PGKSAM). The PGKSAM
calculates the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Score (PGKSAS) using
photon interferometry and superposition to process multiple inputs in parallel.
Experimental results show that PGKET outperforms some state-of-the-art
transformers in multi-classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10, and is
expected to improve performance in complex tasks and accelerate the convergence

*Yiwen Guan,Viet Anh Trinh,Vivek Voleti,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores how multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) improve ASR accuracy in noisy environments, identifying key conditions and architectures for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how integrating multiple input modalities (e.g., speech, text, images) can enhance ASR accuracy, especially in noisy settings, building on prior work.

Method: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data to evaluate the impact of synchronized/unsynchronized modalities, visual representation quality, and model architectures (e.g., Mamba, Transformers).

Result: More modalities generally improve ASR accuracy, with synchronized modalities excelling in high noise and unsynchronized in moderate noise. Visual quality and input order/weighting also significantly affect performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for multi-modal ASR and deepen understanding of modality integration under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other
modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and
model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic
speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities
usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary
information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2)
Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise
levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful
at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations
consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing
more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the
benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities
as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact
accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our
understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of fixed-driven speech in talking face generation and extend the task to a more challenging setting involving both face animation and speech synthesis.

Method: Proposes Face2VoiceSync with Voice-Face Alignment, Diversity & Manipulation, Efficient Training using a lightweight VAE, and a new evaluation metric.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual and audio performance on a single 40GB GPU.

Conclusion: Face2VoiceSync effectively addresses face-voice mismatch and enables diverse, controllable speech generation with efficient training.

Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising
results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications
(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging
setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face
animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and
audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters
than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity
and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pneumonia is a leading cause of child mortality, necessitating fast and accurate diagnostic tools.

Method: The paper proposes an interpretable deep learning model using ResNet-50, enhanced with BayesGrad-CAM for uncertainty-aware visual explanations.

Result: The model achieves 95.94% accuracy, 98.91% AUC-ROC, and 0.913 Cohen's Kappa, with clinically meaningful visual explanations.

Conclusion: High performance and interpretability are achievable and essential for clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual
Networks (ResNets) for automatically diagnosing paediatric pneumonia on chest
X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for
clinical AI deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a learned autoencoder for single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy, improving speed, quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on total variation minimisation for noisy measurements, but learning measurement vectors and reconstruction can enhance performance.

Method: An autoencoder is trained via self-supervision to learn an encoder (measurement matrix) and decoder, tested on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data.

Result: The approach reduces reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, improves image quality, and enables multispectral imaging.

Conclusion: Learned single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological research by offering cost-effective multispectral imaging.

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: Proposes image-to-image diffusion models to enhance realism in brain MRI generation by adding sharp edges, textures, and noise, addressing the smoothness issue in latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models produce overly smooth brain MRIs, lacking fine anatomical details and realistic noise, which this work aims to improve.

Method: Uses image-to-image diffusion models to refine LDM-generated images, incorporating realism metrics like FID and LPIPS, and introduces new metrics for noise, sharpness, and texture.

Result: Enhanced realism and detail in generated brain images, validated by both existing and new metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves the realism of brain MRI generation, addressing limitations of latent diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptations to post-processing techniques in brachytherapy needle reconstruction to handle segmentation errors, improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual needle annotation in image-guided brachytherapy is time-consuming; existing post-processing methods lack robustness to segmentation errors.

Method: A two-stage pipeline (segmentation + post-processing) with proposed adaptations to handle segmentation errors.

Result: Improved reconstruction accuracy: median needle-tip error 1.07 mm, needle-bottom error 0.43 mm, shaft error 0.75 mm, with zero false positives/negatives.

Conclusion: Adapted post-processing techniques effectively manage segmentation errors, enhancing brachytherapy needle reconstruction.

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

TL;DR: A Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model is introduced to denoise medical images by combining noise and contextual information, outperforming baseline methods across multiple modalities and noise types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise in medical imaging degrades quality, leading to misdiagnosis. Existing methods are limited to single modalities or noise types.

Method: DPL integrates noise and context via a dual-pathway architecture, evaluated on multiple modalities and noise types.

Result: DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% over UNet on Gaussian noise, showing robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: DPL effectively denoises medical images by leveraging both noise and context, proving adaptable across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised method (Semi2) improves pulmonary vessel segmentation in COPD patients by 2.3%, achieving 90.3% precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of pulmonary vessels, especially smaller ones, is crucial for COPD analysis.

Method: A teacher-student model is used: a teacher model generates pseudo-labels from labeled CT scans, and a student model is trained on reliable pseudo-labels iteratively.

Result: Semi2 achieves 90.3% precision in vessel segmentation on 125 COPD patients' CT scans, with insights into disease severity.

Conclusion: The method enhances vessel segmentation and aids COPD analysis; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HPCM, a hierarchical progressive context model for image compression, improving long-range dependency and context utilization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with efficiently exploiting long-range dependency and diverse context information in image compression.

Method: HPCM uses a hierarchical coding schedule and progressive context fusion to model dependencies at multiple scales and incorporate past context.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance with balanced computational complexity.

Conclusion: HPCM effectively enhances context modeling in image compression, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

*Niklas Bubeck,Yundi Zhang,Suprosanna Shit,Daniel Rueckert,Jiazhen Pan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes generative models in medical imaging, comparing latent diffusion and autoregressive models for reconstruction and generation tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different generative models perform in medical imaging tasks, particularly in balancing perceptual quality and data fidelity.

Method: Introduces a 'generative model zoo' and benchmarks models on cardiac imaging tasks like inpainting and unconditional generation, varying masking ratios and sampling strategies.

Result: Diffusion models excel in perceptual quality for generation but hallucinate with high masking, while autoregressive models are stable but lower in fidelity.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into model selection for medical imaging tasks, emphasizing trade-offs between quality and fidelity.

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

*Xin Li,Kaixiang Yang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GCDM is a novel framework for synthesizing mammograms with localized lesions using a gated conditional diffusion model, improving realism and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in deep-learning for mammography due to insufficient data and lack of lesion diversity.

Method: Uses a latent denoising diffusion framework with soft mask embeddings and a gated conditioning branch to emphasize lesion features.

Result: Achieves precise control over lesion areas and enhances realism and diversity in synthesized mammograms.

Conclusion: GCDM is a promising tool for clinical mammogram synthesis.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ULS23 segmentation model for longitudinal lesion tracking, revealing its failure due to registration errors and lesion displacement, advocating for integrated end-to-end models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ULS23 model's performance in longitudinal lesion segmentation and identify its limitations in temporal consistency.

Method: Used a public clinical dataset of baseline and follow-up CT scans, artificially displaced input volumes to test segmentation accuracy.

Result: Segmentation quality degrades sharply in follow-up cases due to registration errors and lesion displacement, showing model's reliance on centered lesions.

Conclusion: Robust longitudinal tracking requires integrated, end-to-end models designed for temporal analysis, not cascading single-timepoint tools.

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

### [153] [NerT-CA: Efficient Dynamic Reconstruction from Sparse-view X-ray Coronary Angiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19328)
*Kirsten W. H. Maas,Danny Ruijters,Nicola Pezzotti,Anna Vilanova*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: NerT-CA is a hybrid method combining neural and tensorial representations for faster and more accurate 4D coronary artery reconstruction from sparse X-ray angiograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D/4D coronary artery reconstruction methods are limited by manual or error-prone automatic segmentations and slow training times in NeRF-based approaches.

Method: NerT-CA decomposes the scene into low-rank (tensorial) and sparse (neural) components, enabling efficient static and dynamic reconstruction.

Result: The method outperforms prior works in speed and accuracy, achieving reasonable reconstructions from just three views.

Conclusion: NerT-CA offers a promising solution for clinical 4D coronary artery reconstruction, validated on phantom datasets.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

*Weisong Zhao,Jingkai Zhou,Xiangyu Zhu,Weihua Chen,Xiao-Yu Zhang,Zhen Lei,Fan Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RealisVSR introduces innovations to address challenges in Video Super-Resolution (VSR), including inconsistent temporal dynamics, limited high-frequency detail recovery, and lack of 4K evaluation. It uses CPC architecture, HR-Loss, and a new 4K benchmark, achieving superior results with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses persistent challenges in VSR: inconsistent temporal dynamics, poor high-frequency detail recovery, and inadequate evaluation for 4K super-resolution.

Method: Proposes RealisVSR with three innovations: 1) CPC architecture for motion modeling, 2) HR-Loss for texture restoration, and 3) RealisVideo-4K benchmark. Uses Wan2.1 diffusion model for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on benchmarks (REDS, SPMCS, etc.), especially in ultra-high-resolution scenarios, with reduced training data (5-25% of competitors).

Conclusion: RealisVSR effectively tackles VSR challenges, offering improved detail recovery and scalability to 4K, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through
diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in
GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist
in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational
models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world
degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K
super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with
inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a
high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core
innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated
with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and
suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)
combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture
restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing
1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal
guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume
compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,
SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our
superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge, addressing the underexplored robustness of deep learning models in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis against motion artifacts. It presents a curated dataset, tasks, and evaluation of 22 algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for CMR analysis rely on high-quality images, but motion artifacts degrade clinical CMR acquisitions. The challenge aims to explore model robustness against such artifacts.

Method: Organized a challenge with two tasks: automated image quality assessment and robust myocardial segmentation. Used a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 volunteers with induced motion artifacts.

Result: 22 algorithms were evaluated, with top-performing methods reported. The impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers was investigated.

Conclusion: The challenge promotes research in robust CMR analysis. All resources and code are publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in automated
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis. However, the efficacy of these
models is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, artifact-free
images. In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by
respiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such
artifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,
we organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released
a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed
specific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion
artifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality
assessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust
myocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22
algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports
the evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates
the impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers. All

*Abdul Hannan,Zahid Mahmood,Rizwan Qureshi,Hazrat Ali*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention mechanism-based deep learning model combining GAB and CAB to address imbalanced data in DR classification, achieving competitive performance on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced data distribution in DR datasets hinders model generalization, necessitating an effective solution for accurate classification.

Method: Uses GAB and CAB in a deep learning model with MobileNetV3-small, EfficientNet-b0, and DenseNet-169 backbones, evaluated on APTOS and EYEPACS datasets.

Result: Achieved accuracies up to 83.20% (DenseNet-169 on APTOS) and 80% (EfficientNet-b0 on EYEPACS), with strong F1-score, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa scores.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles imbalanced data and performs competitively, offering a lightweight solution (e.g., MobileNetV3-small with fewer parameters).

Abstract: Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist
ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical
component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the
dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models
trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block
(GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus
effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR
classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based
deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely,
MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone
architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available
datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on
the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by
the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80%
accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a
mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded
75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the
F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of
95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work,
the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90
million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than
other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is
at par with recently reported works on DR classification.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAM2-Aug enhances tumor segmentation in ART by using prior knowledge and prompt augmentation, outperforming other models across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tumor segmentation is crucial for adaptive radiation therapy but is time-consuming and user-dependent. SAM2 shows promise but lacks tumor accuracy.

Method: Two strategies: (1) prior MR images/annotations as context, (2) prompt robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. Tested on liver, abdomen, and brain datasets.

Result: SAM2-Aug achieved Dice scores of 0.86 (liver), 0.89 (abdomen), and 0.90 (brain), outperforming other models.

Conclusion: Prior knowledge and prompt diversity improve segmentation accuracy. SAM2-Aug is a robust solution for ART.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy
(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor
accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance
SAM2 for ART.
  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR
images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt
robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The
resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver
dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without
retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86
MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and
prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),
0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across
tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in
boundary-sensitive metrics.
  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity
significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug
offers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PurpCode is a post-training method for creating secure code reasoning models, combining rule learning and reinforcement learning to enhance safety and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for secure code generation and defense against malicious cyberactivities.

Method: Two-stage training: Rule Learning for referencing cybersafety rules and Reinforcement Learning for optimizing safety and utility.

Result: PurpCode-32B achieves state-of-the-art cybersafety and reduces overrefusal rates while maintaining utility.

Conclusion: PurpCode effectively balances safety and utility in code reasoning models.

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code
reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious
cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule
Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to
generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious
cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety
and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms.
To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we
conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage
prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the
model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely
PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming
various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model
overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while
preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for multimodal systems in social robots to enhance open-domain conversations, proposing vision-language models as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models in social robots lack the ability to utilize multiple modalities, limiting their social interaction capabilities.

Method: The paper suggests adapting vision-language models to process visual information for autonomous social robots, addressing technical challenges and evaluation.

Result: Vision-language models are identified as capable of handling diverse visual inputs for social interactions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of vision-language models for improving social robots' multimodal interaction skills.

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry
social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented
interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual
information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We
describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain,
and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Perpetua is a method for modeling semi-static feature dynamics in robotic environments, enabling prediction of future states with prior knowledge, multiple hypotheses tracking, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems in dynamic environments lack methods to predict future states of changing features, often filtering observations instead.

Method: Chains mixtures of 'persistence' and 'emergence' filters in a Bayesian framework to model feature disappearance/reappearance probabilities.

Result: Perpetua outperforms similar methods in accuracy, adapts online, and handles missing observations robustly.

Conclusion: Perpetua provides an efficient, scalable, and general solution for predicting feature states in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack consideration for task heterogeneity, agent capabilities, and alignment with user demands, hindering practical deployment.

Method: OS-MAP evaluates agents on automation levels (five-level taxonomy) and generalization scope (demand hierarchy), creating a performance-generalization matrix.

Result: State-of-the-art agents struggle with higher-level tasks involving perception, reasoning, and coordination.

Conclusion: OS-MAP provides a structured framework to assess and advance computer-using agents, highlighting current limitations and future research directions.

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained traffic data is crucial for applications like autonomous driving but is hard to obtain due to sensor limitations and tracking inaccuracies.

Method: RoadDiff uses a Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and Lane Diffusion Module to leverage spatio-temporal dependencies for lane-level traffic inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets validate RoadDiff's effectiveness in addressing the FRTI task.

Conclusion: RoadDiff provides a cost-effective solution for precise traffic management by inferring detailed lane-level traffic states.

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for remote physiological measurement (RPM) in driving scenarios are limited in scale, diversity, and real-world applicability, hindering progress in driver monitoring.

Method: PhysDrive collects synchronized RGB, near-infrared, and mmWave radar data from 48 drivers, along with six physiological ground truths, covering diverse driving conditions.

Result: The dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of signal-processing and deep-learning methods, establishing benchmarks for multimodal driver monitoring.

Conclusion: PhysDrive is a foundational resource to advance research in multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit systems, with open-source compatibility.

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource

*Huayan Zhang,Shanqiang Wang,Xiaochao Wang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel piecewise smooth Mumford-Shah (MS) mesh segmentation model using relaxed total generalized variation (rTGV) regularization, improving boundary accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MS models focus on piecewise constant segmentation with total variation, which prioritizes shortest boundaries. The authors aim to improve segmentation for irregular structures by incorporating smoothness and high-order discontinuity.

Method: The proposed model approximates mesh features as piecewise constant plus smooth functions, using rTGV regularization. It is solved via alternating minimization and ADMM.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark, yielding better boundaries and lower quantitative errors with efficient computation.

Conclusion: The rTGV-based MS model is robust and efficient, offering superior segmentation for irregular structures compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The Mumford-Shah (MS) model is an important technique for mesh segmentation.
Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model
with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of
boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a
novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed
total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that
the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise
constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to
characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly
introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures
and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve
the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and
comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that
our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In
addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art
techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,
the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method.
