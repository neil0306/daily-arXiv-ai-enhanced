To address these, we\npresent the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that\nredefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected\nmodels. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,\nwhere each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the\nknowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further\nenhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the\nlimitations of one-step KD.

We first demonstrate that\napplying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe\nperformance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we\npropose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters\ninto one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of\nholding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be\nrecovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a\nreconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.\nCrucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,\nrecognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized\nfor its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible\nModel Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides\na closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and\ntask-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms\nexisting merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed\nmodels by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reversible Model Merging (RMM) addresses performance degradation in merging low-rank compressed models by creating a compact basis that allows recovery of original task-specific models via linear combinations, rather than collapsing all adapters into a single merged model.", "motivation": "Conventional merging methods applied to low-rank weights (from LoRA or SVD compression) cause severe performance degradation in merged models, highlighting the need for a different approach that preserves individual model capabilities.", "method": "RMM reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space instead of producing a single merged model.

In this work, we\nexamine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language\nmodels. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing\nsampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by\ndecoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states\nof these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.\nTheoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the\nbaseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern\nhardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion\nliterature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth\ntransformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,\nour findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the\nextra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that\nsuch models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,\ndiffusion language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new diffusion forcing sampler accelerates generation in recurrent-depth language models by decoding tokens in parallel while refining latent states through recurrence, achieving up to 5x speedup without tuning.", "motivation": "To examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models, and leverage their similarities to develop more efficient generation methods.", "method": "Developed a diffusion forcing sampler that decodes new tokens at every forward pass while refining latent states in parallel through recurrence, based on principles from diffusion literature.", "result": "The sampler provides strictly more expressive generation than autoregressive baselines with the same time budget, and achieves up to 5x speedup when applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without tuning.", "conclusion": "Recurrent-depth models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models, and the proposed sampler provides an efficient mechanism for parallelizing their extra computation at inference."}}
