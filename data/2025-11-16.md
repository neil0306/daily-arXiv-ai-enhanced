*Omnilingual ASR team,Gil Keren,Artyom Kozhevnikov,Yen Meng,Christophe Ropers,Matthew Setzler,Skyler Wang,Ife Adebara,Michael Auli,Can Balioglu,Kevin Chan,Chierh Cheng,Joe Chuang,Caley Droof,Mark Duppenthaler,Paul-Ambroise Duquenne,Alexander Erben,Cynthia Gao,Gabriel Mejia Gonzalez,Kehan Lyu,Sagar Miglani,Vineel Pratap,Kaushik Ram Sadagopan,Safiyyah Saleem,Arina Turkatenko,Albert Ventayol-Boada,Zheng-Xin Yong,Yu-An Chung,Jean Maillard,Rashel Moritz,Alexandre Mourachko,Mary Williamson,Shireen Yates*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omnilingual ASR is a scalable, extensible speech recognition system that supports over 1,600 languages—including 500+ previously unserved—using only minimal data samples per language through zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most of the world's 7,000+ languages lack ASR support due to high costs, limited architectures, and ethical concerns about community exclusion. Current systems are inaccessible and fail to serve long-tail languages.

Method: Combines 7B-parameter self-supervised pre-training for robust speech representations with an encoder-decoder architecture inspired by LLMs, enabling zero-shot generalization. Uses diverse training data from public resources and compensated community partnerships.

Result: Achieves largest ASR coverage to date (1,600+ languages), with 500+ languages served for the first time. Shows substantial gains in low-resource conditions and strong generalization in automatic evaluations.

Conclusion: Open-sourcing models (300M to 7B parameters) lowers barriers for communities and researchers. Ethical design through compensated partnerships and community collaboration enables sustainable, inclusive ASR expansion.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

### [2] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Example ordering in in-context learning has comparable impact to example selection, challenging the common assumption that selection matters more than ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common assumption in ICL that example selection has greater impact than example ordering, and systematically compare their effects.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments on classification and generation tasks using multiple model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, comparing variance from different orderings vs different example sets.

Result: Variance from different example orderings is comparable to variance from using entirely different example sets. Strong orderings can be identified using development sets, achieving performance close to oracle selection.

Conclusion: Example selection and ordering are equally important and intertwined in prompt design, requiring reexamination of ICL assumptions.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

### [3] [Contextual morphologically-guided tokenization for Latin encoder models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09709)
*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Morphologically-aware tokenization improves Latin language model performance, especially for out-of-domain texts, by leveraging linguistic resources instead of relying solely on large pretraining data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tokenization methods prioritize information-theoretical goals over linguistic alignment, which is suboptimal for morphologically rich languages like Latin where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance.

Method: Investigated morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin by leveraging curated lexical resources to create linguistically-aligned tokenization rather than using standard information-theoretical approaches.

Result: Morphologically-guided tokenization improved overall performance on four downstream tasks, with most significant gains for out-of-domain texts, demonstrating improved generalization ability.

Conclusion: Linguistic resources can effectively improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages, serving as a feasible alternative to large-scale pretraining data for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

### [4] [Assessing the Applicability of Natural Language Processing to Traditional Social Science Methodology: A Case Study in Identifying Strategic Signaling Patterns in Presidential Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09738)
*C. LeMay,A. Lane,J. Seales,M. Winstead,S. Baty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLP can identify signaling themes in Presidential Directives but shows discrepancies with human analysis, indicating need for validation in social science applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore NLP's utility in extracting main topics from large written corpora, specifically signaling themes in Presidential Directives from Reagan to Clinton administrations.

Method: Used Natural Language Processing to analyze Presidential Directives and compared results with human analyst identifications of relevant documents.

Result: NLP successfully identified relevant documents similar to human analysts, but discrepancies between automated and human-labeled results were observed.

Conclusion: While NLP shows potential for large corpus analysis, validation is needed due to identified discrepancies, and the rapidly evolving AI/ML landscape means current tools may already be outdated.

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [5] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small LLMs (1B parameters) can effectively detect critical translation errors with good quality-efficiency trade-off, enabling on-device deployment for privacy-sensitive translation workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs are effective for machine translation evaluation but are too resource-intensive for edge devices and privacy-sensitive applications, creating a need for smaller models that can still detect meaning-altering errors.

Method: Benchmarked sub-2B parameter models on English->German Critical Error Detection using standardized prompts, logit-bias calibration, and majority voting across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025 datasets.

Result: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off (MCC=0.77, F1-ERR=0.98) with 400ms latency on MacBook Pro M4 Pro. Qwen-3-1.7B achieves highest MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. Ultra-small models (0.6B) are usable but under-detect entity and number errors.

Conclusion: Compact instruction-tuned LLMs with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy on-device critical error detection for machine translation, enabling private and low-cost error screening in real-world pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [6] [Predicate-Argument Structure Divergences in Chinese and English Parallel Sentences and their Impact on Language Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09796)
*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis shows cross-lingual predicate-argument structure transfer is asymmetric between Chinese and English, requiring careful source language selection in transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand linguistic divergences in cross-lingual NLP, particularly predicate-argument structures between typologically distant languages like Chinese and English.

Method: Analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese-English sentences using annotation projection experiments where each language serves as source for the other.

Result: Language transfer is asymmetric - performance differs significantly depending on which language is used as source.

Conclusion: Source language selection is crucial in cross-lingual transfer learning and requires investigation before making scientific claims about cross-lingual NLP.

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [7] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG) is a lightweight method that decides when to retrieve information for RAG systems using only short draft outputs, reducing retrieval by 70-90% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation improves factuality but retrieving for every query increases latency and computational costs unnecessarily.

Method: TARG uses a single-shot policy that analyzes prefix logits from base model drafts to compute uncertainty scores (token entropy, top-1/top-2 logit margin, or small-N variance) and triggers retrieval only when uncertainty exceeds a threshold.

Result: On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG matches or improves accuracy compared to Always-RAG while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, with minimal overhead compared to Never-RAG.

Conclusion: The margin signal from top logits is a robust default uncertainty measure for modern LLMs, with small-N variance offering a conservative alternative, enabling explicit budget-accuracy trade-offs without additional training.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

### [8] [Khmer Spellchecking: A Holistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09812)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a holistic approach for Khmer spellchecking that integrates subword segmentation, NER, G2P conversion, and language models to address unique Khmer language challenges, achieving 94.4% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Khmer spellchecking faces unique challenges including word segmentation misalignments, multiple word forms, loose compound word formation, and proper noun misidentification due to lack of NER models, which existing solutions fail to adequately address.

Method: Integrates Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer named-entity recognition (NER), Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to identify and rank correction candidates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of 94.4%, significantly outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The holistic approach effectively addresses Khmer-specific spellchecking challenges and will make benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER publicly available.

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

### [10] [Answering Students' Questions on Course Forums Using Multiple Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Finetuning RAG-Enabled LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09831)
*Neo Wang,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a question answering system using fine-tuned LLM with RAG method to address repetitive student queries in course forums, achieving strong performance on HotpotQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in course forums where increased student enrollment leads to delayed responses and repetitive questions that instructors must handle manually.

Method: Fine-tune open source LLM on course dataset, use local knowledge base with RAG for document retrieval, and integrate multi chain-of-thought reasoning to reduce hallucination.

Result: Experimental results on HotpotQA dataset show that fine-tuned LLM with RAG method achieves strong performance in question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively mitigates forum challenges by providing timely, accurate responses to student queries while reducing instructor workload through automated question answering.

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

### [11] [TermGPT: Multi-Level Contrastive Fine-Tuning for Terminology Adaptation in Legal and Financial Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09854)
*Yidan Sun,Mengying Zhu,Feiyue Chen,Yangyang Wu,Xiaolei Dan,Mengyuan Yang,Xiaolin Zheng,Shenglin Ben*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TermGPT is a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework that addresses LLM embedding isotropy in legal/financial domains by using sentence graphs and multi-level contrastive learning to improve terminology discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from isotropy in embedding spaces, leading to poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology in legal and financial contexts, which hinders critical downstream tasks like legal judgment prediction and financial risk analysis.

Method: Construct sentence graphs to capture semantic relations, generate discriminative samples using contextual and topological cues, and apply multi-level contrastive learning at both sentence and token levels.

Result: TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within finance and legal domains, with evaluation supported by the first financial terminology dataset from official regulatory documents.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances terminology discrimination in domain-specific contexts through multi-level contrastive learning and structured semantic modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

*Mingye Zhu,Yi Liu,Zheren Fu,Quan Wang,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTRO is a new framework for training LLMs that enables token-level exploration and self-feedback for chain-of-thought reasoning, addressing limitations of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning penalizes equally valid reasoning alternatives, while reinforcement learning struggles with credit assignment and high computational costs, creating challenges for training LLMs for chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: InTRO uses correction factors - token-wise importance weights estimated from information discrepancy between generative policy and answer-conditioned policy - to enable token-level exploration and self-generated feedback within a single forward pass.

Result: Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms baselines, improving solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to base model, with notably more concise rationales and reduced verbosity.

Conclusion: InTRO demonstrates robust generalization through cross-domain transfer to out-of-domain reasoning tasks beyond mathematics, showing it enables accurate and concise reasoning while overcoming previous training limitations.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

*Nikunj Gupta,Bill Guo,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor K. Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HierRouter is a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from specialized lightweight LLMs using reinforcement learning, improving response quality by up to 2.4x with minimal additional cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have high computational and memory costs that limit deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings, requiring more efficient inference methods.

Method: Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, trains a PPO-based RL agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference, conditioning on evolving context and accumulated cost.

Result: Experiments with three open-source LLMs across six benchmarks show HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to individual models, with only minimal additional inference cost.

Conclusion: Hierarchical routing shows promise for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference by dynamically assembling specialized models into optimized inference pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

### [14] [EnchTable: Unified Safety Alignment Transfer in Fine-tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09880)
*Jialin Wu,Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinfeng Li,Xiaofeng Wang,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnchTable is a framework that maintains safety alignment in fine-tuned LLMs through NTK-based safety vector distillation and interference-aware merging, achieving better safety and utility than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for specialized domains often degrades their safety alignment, increasing risks of harmful outputs despite improved task performance.

Method: Uses Neural Tangent Kernel-based safety vector distillation to decouple safety constraints from task reasoning, plus interference-aware merging to balance safety and utility across different model architectures.

Result: Achieves significantly lower unsafe rates and higher utility scores than 6 parameter modification methods and 2 inference-time baselines, with robust resistance to jailbreaking attacks across 11 datasets.

Conclusion: EnchTable effectively maintains safety alignment in fine-tuned LLMs without performance compromises, demonstrating universal applicability and seamless integration into deployment pipelines.

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

Motivation: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals by introducing the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology.

Method: Uses comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with facial landmark detection, lip region isolation/stabilization, and multimodal quality assessment. Implements curriculum learning guided by quality scores. Adopts SigLIP encoder with Unified 3D-Resampler for high-frame-rate lip motion encoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HI-Dialogue dataset in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology with end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools.

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

*Pritish Sahu,Anirudh Som,Dimitra Vergyri,Ajay Divakaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Norm-RAG is a retrieval-augmented framework for social norm reasoning in multi-turn dialogues that models utterance attributes and grounds them in normative documentation via Semantic Chunking, improving norm detection and generalization across cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social norm reasoning is challenging due to its subjective, context-dependent nature and cultural variations. Prior works focus on isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture real-world multi-turn conversations.

Method: Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes (communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, linguistic cues) and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via Semantic Chunking. Introduces MINDS dataset with 31 bilingual multi-turn conversations annotated for norm categories and adherence.

Result: Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrating better performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

Conclusion: The framework enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues, addressing limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

### [17] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Identifying Knowledge Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09935)
*Canwen Wang,Jionghao Lin,Kenneth R. Koedinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can automate Knowledge Component (KC) identification but produce redundant labels. A semantic merging strategy using cosine similarity significantly improves performance by reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual KC identification by experts is a bottleneck in adaptive learning systems. LLMs offer automation potential but previous approaches suffered from small datasets and produced redundant KC labels.

Method: Scaled LLM prompting (GPT-4o-mini) on 646 multiple-choice questions, followed by a novel semantic merging technique using cosine similarity to combine similar KC labels.

Result: Initial LLM approach performed worse than expert model (RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206) with excessive KCs (569 vs 101). Semantic merging at 0.8 threshold reduced KCs to 428 and improved RMSE to 0.4259.

Conclusion: Scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, but combining it with semantic merging offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification in adaptive learning systems.

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

### [18] [REAP: Enhancing RAG with Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning for Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09966)
*Yijie Zhu,Haojie Zhou,Wanting Hong,Tailin Liu,Ning Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REAP is a retrieval-augmented generation method that uses recursive evaluation and adaptive planning to improve multi-hop reasoning in LLMs by maintaining structured sub-tasks and facts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods for multi-hop reasoning lack global planning, risk local reasoning impasses, and insufficiently exploit retrieved content, leading to inaccurate reasoning outcomes.

Method: REAP uses Sub-task Planner (SP) for global reasoning direction and task state evaluation, and Fact Extractor (FE) for fine-grained analysis of retrieved content, incrementally building coherent global knowledge representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple multi-hop datasets show REAP significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: REAP enhances reliability and traceability of reasoning processes and effectively handles complex multi-hop reasoning tasks through its unified task paradigm and adaptive planning approach.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with numerical reasoning in fact-checking tasks, showing significant accuracy drops (up to 62%) under controlled perturbations, with no model proving robust across all conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform well on knowledge-intensive tasks but have limitations in numerical reasoning, which needs systematic evaluation for veracity prediction on numerical claims.

Method: Systematic evaluation using controlled perturbations including label-flipping probes to test robustness of state-of-the-art models on numerical claims and evidence pairs.

Result: Even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops up to 62% under perturbations; increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but enriched context with perturbed demonstrations helps most models recover substantially.

Conclusion: Numerical fact-checking has critical limitations and robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

### [20] [Modeling Uncertainty Trends for Timely Retrieval in Dynamic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09980)
*Bo Li,Tian Tian,Zhenghua Xu,Hao Cheng,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETC is a training-free method that uses entropy trend analysis to determine optimal retrieval timing in dynamic RAG systems, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval than confidence-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic RAG methods trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which often leads to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. There's a need for more proactive retrieval timing.

Method: ETC uses first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, allowing it to identify when retrieval is needed before errors occur.

Result: Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones show ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency, with particular effectiveness in domain-specific scenarios.

Conclusion: Trend-aware uncertainty modeling provides more effective retrieval timing than confidence-based approaches, and ETC offers a plug-and-play, model-agnostic solution that integrates easily into existing decoding pipelines.

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

*Bo Li,Zhenghua Xu,Rui Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual RAG suffers from language drift where models generate responses in unintended languages, especially during reasoning. This is caused by decoder-level collapse and English dominance. The paper proposes Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD) to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of language drift in multilingual RAG systems where models generate responses in unintended languages when retrieved evidence differs from query language, particularly during reasoning-intensive tasks like Chain-of-Thought generation.

Method: Proposed Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight training-free decoding strategy that penalizes non-target-language tokens to steer generation toward the target language. It's model-agnostic and works with any generation algorithm without architecture changes or additional data.

Result: Experiments across three multilingual datasets and diverse languages show SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance in multilingual RAG settings.

Conclusion: SCD provides an effective and generalizable solution to mitigate language drift in multilingual RAG by addressing decoder-level collapse and English dominance through gentle steering during generation.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

*Yu-Shiang Huang,Yun-Yu Lee,Tzu-Hsin Chou,Che Lin,Chuan-Ju Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BERTScore fails to detect numerical variations in financial texts, leading to inaccurate semantic similarity assessments in finance where numbers are critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTScore's low sensitivity to numerical variation is problematic in finance, where numerical precision directly impacts meaning (e.g., distinguishing 2% gain vs 20% loss).

Method: Created FinNuE diagnostic dataset with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles to test BERTScore's numerical sensitivity.

Result: BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs.

Conclusion: Embedding-based metrics like BERTScore have fundamental limitations for finance, motivating the need for numerically-aware evaluation frameworks in financial NLP.

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show potential for personalized education in resource-limited regions, but face challenges in adapting to specific curricula like NCERT with accuracy and pedagogical relevance.

Method: Created NCERT-QA dataset aligned with grades 6-8 English and Science, classified into Factoid, Inferential, and Others categories. Evaluated using meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting with diverse metrics.

Result: Analyzed performance of open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B, Deepseek-r1-70B) as educational tools.

Conclusion: Identified strengths and limitations of current LLMs for formal education systems, providing insights into effective curriculum-aligned AI learning tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

*Jiangshu Du,Wenpeng Yin,Philip Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScaleFormer is a plug-and-play framework that adapts pre-trained encoder-decoder models to handle long sequences by segmenting inputs into overlapping chunks and using parameter-free fusion to provide structural awareness, achieving linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-attention has quadratic complexity that limits Transformer models in long-context tasks, and existing efficient variants require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch.

Method: Segment long inputs into overlapping chunks, generate compressed context-aware representations, and use a novel parameter-free fusion mechanism that enriches each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context from preceding and succeeding chunks.

Result: Experiments on long-document summarization show the method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval.

Conclusion: ScaleFormer enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text with linear complexity while maintaining strong performance on long-context tasks.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs show phonetic intuition aligning with linguistic research on sound symbolism, with attention patterns focusing on iconic phonemes across text and audio modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Multimodal Large Language Models interpret auditory information through phonetic iconicity as a probe into their understanding of sound symbolism in human languages.

Method: Created LEX-ICON dataset with 8,052 words from 4 languages and 2,930 pseudo-words, analyzed MLLMs' layer-wise processing using phoneme-level attention scores across 25 semantic dimensions in both text and audio inputs.

Result: MLLMs demonstrate phonetic intuitions that align with linguistic research and show phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight focus on iconic phonemes across multiple semantic dimensions.

Conclusion: This study provides the first large-scale quantitative analysis of phonetic iconicity in MLLMs, bridging AI and cognitive linguistics by revealing models' interpretability of sound symbolism.

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

*Zhenhe Li,Can Lin,Ling Zheng,Wen-Da Wei,Junli Liang,Qi Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphIF is a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and uses graph prompts to enhance LLMs' instruction following capabilities without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat multi-turn dialogue responses as isolated tasks and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into optimization objectives, leading to struggles with complex long-distance constraints.

Method: GraphIF has three components: agent-based relation extraction to construct structured graphs, relation graph prompt generation to convert graphs to natural language prompts, and response rewriting to refine LLM outputs using graph prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets show GraphIF significantly improves all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics when integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: Graph structures are effective for modeling multi-turn instruction following, and GraphIF provides a seamless way to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this area through graph-based prompting.

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs perform better with table-based evidence than chart-based evidence for scientific claim verification, showing limited cross-modal generalization and highlighting a gap in chart understanding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing scientific paper submissions, there's demand for systems to assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results presented in varying formats (tables/charts) need robust verification, but current multimodal LLMs' capabilities across different evidence formats remain underexplored.

Method: Adapted two existing scientific paper datasets with annotations for multimodal claim verification. Evaluated 12 multimodal LLMs on their ability to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. Conducted human evaluations for comparison.

Result: Current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. Humans maintain strong performance across both formats. Smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation between table and chart task performance, indicating limited cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: There's a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities, particularly in chart understanding. Future multimodal LLMs should focus on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

We participated in the Spoken Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) and multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtasks. Our submission ranked first for the ADI subtask and second for the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR subtask among all participants. Our ADI system is a fine-tuned Whisper-large-v3 encoder with data augmentation. This system obtained the highest ADI accuracy score of \textbf{79.83\%} on the official test set. For multi-dialectal Arabic ASR, we fine-tuned SeamlessM4T-v2 Large (Egyptian variant) separately for each of the eight considered dialects. Overall, we obtained an average WER and CER of \textbf{38.54\%} and \textbf{14.53\%}, respectively, on the test set. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of large pre-trained speech models with targeted fine-tuning for Arabic speech processing.

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

TL;DR: VISTA is a web-based visual interactive system that helps analyze multi-turn reasoning in LLMs by visualizing context influence, enabling what-if analyses, and generating reasoning dependency trees to reduce analysis complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current analysis of LLM reasoning in multi-turn interactions is challenging due to complex contextual dependencies and lack of specialized visualization tools, creating high cognitive load for researchers.

Method: Developed VISTA - a web-based visual interactive system that visualizes context influence on model decisions, allows interactive modification of conversation histories for what-if analyses, and automatically generates reasoning dependency trees.

Result: VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains and provides a transparent view of model's step-by-step logical paths, facilitating deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: VISTA offers a unified interactive framework for analyzing multi-turn reasoning in LLMs, is open-source, and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2SQL-Flow is a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data, creating SQLFlow dataset (89,544 examples) and improving LLM performance through fine-tuning and novel retrieval methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in Text-to-SQL performance caused by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets by creating a scalable data-centric solution.

Method: Six-dimensional data augmentation framework with SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning, data classification, and modular Database Manager for cross-database compatibility.

Result: Created SQLFlow dataset of 89,544 annotated examples; improved open-source LLM performance via fine-tuning; outperformed existing retrieval methods for closed-source LLMs using masked alignment retrieval.

Conclusion: Establishes scalable data-centric foundation for Text-to-SQL systems and highlights critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

*Guanrong Li,Xinyu Liu,Zhen Wu,Xinyu Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAL is a persona-aware alignment framework that treats persona alignment as the training objective for dialogue generation, using a two-stage training method to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream personalized dialogue models rely on token-level language model training and tend to neglect given personas, generating generic responses instead of persona-relevant ones.

Method: Two-stage training: Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, with Select then Generate inference strategy to improve persona sensitivity at semantics level.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed PAL framework effectively addresses persona neglect in dialogue generation by directly treating persona alignment as the training objective.

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangGPS is a lightweight two-stage framework that improves multilingual instruction tuning by selecting training data based on language separability - how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods for multilingual training overlook linguistic structure, making multilingual capabilities sensitive to training data composition. The authors aim to incorporate linguistic considerations into data selection.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Filter training data based on language separability scores, 2) Refine subset using existing selection methods. Language separability quantifies how distinguishable samples are across languages in representation space.

Result: Experiments across 6 benchmarks and 22 languages show LangGPS improves effectiveness and generalizability of existing selection methods, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Highly separable samples form clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation.

Conclusion: Language separability provides a valuable perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and can guide more linguistically informed LLM development. It also serves as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning.

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end spoken language models suffer from high response latency due to autoregressive generation of speech tokens and complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis.

Method: Integrates multi-codebook tokenizer and multi-token prediction strategy to directly generate multi-codebook speech tokens, eliminating flow-matching models and enhancing generation efficiency.

Result: Achieves substantial reduction in first chunk latency from approximately 725ms to 350ms while maintaining competitive performance compared to mainstream SLMs.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTR-DuplexBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) in multi-round conversations, addressing gaps in existing evaluations that focus only on single-round interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for FD-SLMs are inadequate as they primarily evaluate single-round interactions and overlook multi-round communication complexities, instruction following, and safety aspects.

Method: The authors introduce MTR-DuplexBench which segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling turn-by-turn evaluation across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety.

Result: Experimental results show current FD-SLMs struggle to maintain consistent performance across multiple rounds and different evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: The benchmark effectively highlights the limitations of current FD-SLMs and the need for comprehensive multi-round evaluation, with the benchmark and code to be released in the future.

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLMs' imbalanced evaluation preference in multi-step mathematical reasoning by proposing a perplexity-aware reinforcement learning method to improve critiquing capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on supervised fine-tuning for critiquing enhancement but overlook the underlying reason for poor performance - imbalanced evaluation preference where LLMs tend to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct.

Method: Built OPS benchmark to quantify LLMs' critiquing behavior differences, conducted statistical preference analysis, and proposed Group Relative Policy Optimization using perplexity as guidance to explore trajectories that correct the evaluation preference.

Result: Extensive experiments on OPS and existing critic benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in improving critiquing capability by rectifying the imbalanced evaluation preference.

Conclusion: The proposed perplexity-aware reinforcement learning successfully addresses the imbalanced evaluation preference issue in LLMs, significantly enhancing their multi-step mathematical reasoning critiquing performance.

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Conclusion: The study provides systematic insights into synthetic data generation for low-resource languages, demonstrating effective quality control methods and highlighting optimal strategies for building multilingual pretraining corpora.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

Result: Successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge with high performance: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively.

Conclusion: ATR4CH provides the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies, offering a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and enabling institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs.

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: TruthfulRAG is a framework that uses Knowledge Graphs to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems, outperforming existing methods by improving response accuracy and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems struggle with conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which compromises accuracy. Current approaches operate at token/semantic levels, leading to fragmented understanding of factual discrepancies.

Method: Constructs Knowledge Graphs from retrieved content, uses query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering to locate and mitigate conflicting elements.

Result: Extensive experiments show TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

Conclusion: TruthfulRAG successfully addresses factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems through KG-based approach, enabling more faithful and accurate LLM responses.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

TL;DR: Evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities is methodologically flawed due to mismatch between pretraining objectives and normative reasoning assessment criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight methodological concerns in existing studies that evaluate base LLMs' reasoning capabilities, challenging assumptions about their outputs representing genuine reasoning attempts.

Method: Analyzing the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective (statistical plausibility) and normative reasoning qualities (correctness), showing how valid/invalid conclusions are coincidental byproducts.

Result: Demonstrates that base LLMs generate conclusions as coincidental outcomes of linguistic pattern conformity rather than bona fide reasoning attempts, challenging generalization to post-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Calls for critical re-examination of existing work and future research to account for methodological pitfalls in evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

*Cristian Santini,Sebastian Barzaghi,Paolo Sernani,Emanuele Frontoni,Mehwish Alam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELICATE is a neuro-symbolic Entity Linking method for historical Italian that combines BERT with Wikidata context, outperforming larger models and providing more explainable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity Linking remains challenging in humanities due to complex document types, lack of domain-specific datasets/models, and long-tail entities underrepresented in Knowledge Bases.

Method: DELICATE combines BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. Also created ENEIDE corpus from 19th-20th century Italian texts.

Result: DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian, even compared to larger billion-parameter architectures. Provides more explainable and interpretable results through confidence scores and feature sensitivity.

Conclusion: The neuro-symbolic approach effectively addresses EL challenges in historical Italian, demonstrating superior performance and explainability over purely neural methods.

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

*Chunyang Jiang,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analogical paradigm organization enables lightweight models to achieve strong linguistic performance with minimal data, outperforming large models like GPT-3 on structured completion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if analogical organization can help lightweight models match large language model performance using minimal training data, inspired by cognitive principles.

Method: Developed computational approach with three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. Tested on structured completion tasks using lightweight models (BERT+CNN, 0.5M parameters) trained on only 100 examples.

Result: Achieved F1=0.95 on English causative/inchoative alternations, outperforming zero-shot GPT-3 (F1=0.87). Cross-validation with unspecified object alternations confirmed robustness. Ablation studies showed analogical organization and contrastive structure consistently improved performance.

Conclusion: Analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

TL;DR: Proposes generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in structured responses for ambiguous requests to improve coverage and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address intent misunderstandings in LLMs that frustrate users and create safety risks when models implicitly commit to single interpretations.

Method: Train models with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision to generate structured interpretation-answer pairs.

Result: Achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baselines on conversational QA and semantic parsing; human evaluation shows high alignment between interpretations and answers.

Conclusion: Approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency with single generation step, and supports downstream applications through structured output.

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

*Kiamehr Rezaee,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can perform state tracking tasks, with newer models like GPT-4 and Llama3 showing better capabilities, especially when using Chain of Thought, while older models fail after multiple steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' state tracking capabilities by isolating this component from other factors using well-defined tasks.

Method: Proposed a benchmark with three state tracking tasks and analyzed LLM performance across different scenarios, including using Chain of Thought mechanisms.

Result: Recent LLMs (GPT-4, Llama3) can track state effectively, particularly with Chain of Thought, while older models understand the task initially but fail after several steps.

Conclusion: Newer generation LLMs demonstrate improved state tracking capabilities, with Chain of Thought integration enhancing performance, highlighting the evolution of reasoning abilities in language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

### [49] [LocalBench: Benchmarking LLMs on County-Level Local Knowledge and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10459)
*Zihan Gao,Yifei Xu,Jacob Thebault-Spieker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LocalBench is the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the US, revealing significant limitations in handling hyper-local information despite good performance on macro-scale geographic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of hyper-local knowledge needed for real-world applications like civic platforms and community journalism, creating a gap in understanding LLMs' ability to reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics.

Method: Created LocalBench with 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 US counties, integrating Census data, local subreddit discourse, and regional news across physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality.

Result: Even top-performing LLMs achieve only 56.8% accuracy on narrative questions and below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Web augmentation shows inconsistent effects - improves Gemini by +13.6% but reduces GPT-series by -11.4%.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems capable of engaging with fine-grained local realities across geographic and cultural contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

*Yunzhe Xu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KPPO is a prompt optimization framework that integrates systematic knowledge provision rather than just eliciting model capabilities, achieving ~6% performance improvement on knowledge-intensive tasks with up to 29% token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods focus on elicitation-based strategies that operate within fixed parametric boundaries, lacking the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns needed for specialized domains.

Method: Proposes Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO) with three innovations: knowledge gap filling mechanism, batch-wise candidate evaluation, and adaptive knowledge pruning strategy.

Result: Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks shows ~6% average performance improvement over strongest baselines while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Conclusion: KPPO demonstrates that systematic knowledge integration is more effective than potential elicitation for knowledge-intensive tasks, providing both performance gains and token efficiency.

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvancedIF, a benchmark for evaluating complex instruction following in LLMs, and proposes RIFL, a training pipeline that uses rubric-based reinforcement learning to improve instruction following capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced instruction following for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions remains challenging for LLMs, with limitations in evaluation benchmarks and reliable training signals.

Method: Proposes RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning) - a post-training pipeline using rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping for reinforcement learning.

Result: RIFL achieves 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF benchmark and strong results on public benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: Rubrics serve as powerful tools for both training and evaluating advanced instruction following in LLMs, enabling more capable and reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

### [53] [Say It Differently: Linguistic Styles as Jailbreak Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10519)
*Srikant Panda,Avinash Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Linguistic style variation is an overlooked jailbreak attack surface that significantly increases LLM vulnerability to generating unsafe content, with style neutralization as an effective mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations focus on semantic equivalence but overlook linguistic style variation as a potential attack vector for jailbreaking aligned models.

Method: Constructed style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 datasets into 11 linguistic styles using templates and LLM rewrites, then evaluated 16 models and introduced style neutralization preprocessing.

Result: Stylistic reframing increased jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points, with fearful, curious and compassionate styles being most effective. Style neutralization significantly reduced jailbreak success.

Conclusion: Linguistic style represents a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability in current LLM safety pipelines that requires specific mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A comprehensive conversational memory benchmark with 75K+ QA pairs reveals that simple full-context approaches outperform sophisticated RAG systems for conversations under 150 interactions, with practical transition points identified for different conversation lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current conversational memory evaluation frameworks, and to examine the relationship between conversational memory and RAG systems.

Method: Created a benchmark with 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. Compared simple full-context approaches with sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 across different conversation lengths.

Result: Simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy on challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems achieve only 30-45% for conversations under 150 interactions. Long context excels for first 30 conversations, remains viable up to 150 conversations, and requires hybrid/RAG approaches beyond that point.

Conclusion: Conversational memory systems have unique characteristics starting from zero and growing progressively, enabling naive approaches impractical for traditional RAG. The small-corpus advantage deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

*Natasha Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses computational methods to analyze genre fiction vs literary fiction, finding formal markers for each category and showing how female authorship affects literary classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether genre is a valid formal designation rather than just an institutional one, examining the distinction between genre fiction and literary fiction.

Method: Used CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature; compared narrative features using Welch's ANOVA; applied logistic regression to model literary classification effects; analyzed stylistic and semantic vector representations.

Result: Found statistically significant formal markers for each literary category; showed female authorship narrows and blurs the criteria for achieving literary status.

Conclusion: Genre has formal characteristics that can be computationally identified, and author gender significantly moderates how these features affect literary classification.

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

TL;DR: URaG is a framework that unifies retrieval and generation in multimodal large language models for efficient long document understanding, reducing computational costs by 44-56% while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long document understanding due to information interference from irrelevant content and quadratic computational costs. Existing approaches either sacrifice details through token compression or add complexity with external retrievers.

Method: URaG leverages MLLMs' inherent evidence localization by converting early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector through a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module, enabling deeper layers to focus on relevant pages.

Result: Extensive experiments show URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: URaG demonstrates that MLLMs' inherent coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern can be explicitly leveraged for efficient retrieval during reasoning, enabling unified retrieval and generation within a single model for improved long document understanding.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

TL;DR: DESS is a new approach for Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction that integrates DeBERTa with LSTM in a dual-channel framework to better capture relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASTE methods using BERT and GNNs haven't fully exploited advanced language models' potential in understanding complex language patterns and relationships in text.

Method: Dual-channel framework combining DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism with LSTM to process both semantic meaning and grammatical patterns, with refined component integration.

Result: Achieved F1-score improvements of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 on standard datasets for aspect-opinion pair identification and sentiment determination, with better handling of complex sentence structures.

Conclusion: Thoughtful integration of advanced language models like DeBERTa can lead to significant improvements in sentiment analysis accuracy, particularly for handling long-distance dependencies in text.

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

Motivation: To reduce clinical documentation burdens and ensure patient safety by accurately extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations, and to evaluate domain-specific language models for this task.

Method: Systematic evaluation of MedGemma using three prompting paradigms: one-shot approach, ReAct framework, and multi-step agentic workflow on the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task.

Result: Simple one-shot prompting achieved the highest performance on the official validation set, outperforming more complex reasoning frameworks like ReAct and agentic workflows.

Conclusion: Complex reasoning chains can lead to 'overthinking' and introduce noise on manually annotated transcripts, making direct approaches more robust and efficient for clinical information extraction.

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

Result: Mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation enhances clinical precision. Combined approaches show promising performance for reliable wound care support.

Conclusion: The complementary approaches demonstrate effective strategies for developing AI tools that can provide efficient and reliable wound care assistance in remote healthcare settings.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

### [60] [Know Your Limits: Entropy Estimation Modeling for Compression and Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10618)
*Benjamin L. Badger,Matthew Neligeorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces encoder-augmented causal decoder models that achieve better compression than causal transformers and shows that training models to approach estimated per-token entropy improves generalization compared to models trained without considering entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental limit to language model accuracy due to informational entropy, but current causal language models can't efficiently estimate language entropy. The goal is to develop more efficient architectures for entropy estimation and show how entropy-aware training improves generalization.

Method: Developed encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that are more training-efficient than causal transformers. Used these models to obtain per-token entropy estimates and trained models to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies.

Result: The new architectures achieved higher compression than causal transformers even on modest hardware. Models trained to approach estimated per-token entropies exhibited greater generalization than models trained without entropy consideration.

Conclusion: Considering informational entropy in training leads to better generalization, and encoder-augmented causal decoders provide a practical way to approach entropy limits while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time frameworks for LLMs rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting effectiveness on complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Decomposes model responses into (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, performs step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks, and iteratively refines unreliable steps.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs.

Conclusion: SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding LLM reasoning processes while producing more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAD enables black-box distillation of LLMs using a generative adversarial framework where a student LLM (generator) and discriminator co-evolve through a minimax game, outperforming traditional sequence-level knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective black-box distillation of proprietary LLMs without access to internal logits or parameters, overcoming limitations of traditional distillation methods.

Method: Frames student LLM as generator and trains discriminator to distinguish student responses from teacher responses, creating a minimax game where discriminator provides on-policy, adaptive feedback.

Result: GAD consistently surpasses sequence-level knowledge distillation, with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct student becoming comparable to GPT-5-Chat teacher on LMSYS-Chat evaluation.

Conclusion: GAD establishes a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation through its adversarial co-evolution approach.

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

*Yesheng Liang,Haisheng Chen,Song Han,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParoQuant is a weight-only post-training quantization method that uses pairwise Givens rotations and channel-wise scaling to handle outliers in LLMs, achieving better accuracy than AWQ with minimal inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers in weights and activations or introduce significant inference overhead, especially problematic for reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought.

Method: Combines hardware-efficient independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out magnitude across channels and narrow dynamic range within each quantization group, with co-designed inference kernels for GPU parallelism.

Result: Achieves average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead.

Conclusion: Paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs by effectively handling outliers while maintaining low inference overhead.

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

### [65] [FedeCouple: Fine-Grained Balancing of Global-Generalization and Local-Adaptability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09599)
*Ming Yang,Dongrun Li,Xin Wang,Feng Li,Lisheng Fan,Chunxiao Wang,Xiaoming Wu,Peng Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedeCouple is a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability through joint feature learning, dynamic knowledge distillation, and privacy-preserving anchors, achieving superior performance on image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized federated learning methods focus on feature consistency and classification personalization but neglect local extractor adaptability and global classifier generalization, leading to poor component coordination and degraded performance.

Method: Jointly learns global and local feature representations, uses dynamic knowledge distillation for classifier generalization, and introduces privacy-preserving anchors with strict locality to refine feature space while reducing communication overhead.

Result: Outperforms 9 baseline methods by 4.3% on effectiveness metrics across 5 image-classification datasets, with strong performance in stability, scalability, and security. Theoretical analysis proves convergence for nonconvex objectives.

Conclusion: FedeCouple effectively addresses the coordination problem between feature extractors and classifiers in federated learning, achieving better balance between global generalization and local adaptability while maintaining privacy and efficiency.

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential, autoregressive approaches for thinking-aware generation can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation, particularly affecting alignment between generated reasoning and final images.

Method: Proposes MMaDA-Parallel, a parallel multimodal diffusion framework enabling continuous bidirectional text-image interaction throughout denoising, trained with supervised finetuning and optimized via Parallel RL with semantic rewards for cross-modal consistency.

Result: Achieves 6.9% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to state-of-the-art Bagel model, significantly improving cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency.

Conclusion: MMaDA-Parallel establishes a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis by addressing error propagation through parallel multimodal interaction and trajectory-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer vision methods for primate behavior analysis rely on human-centric pretrained models and single datasets, limiting generalization across different primate species and research settings.

Method: Created PriVi dataset with 424 hours of curated primate videos from 11 research settings and web sources, then pretrained V-JEPA model on this data and evaluated with frozen classifiers on four benchmark datasets.

Result: Outperformed prior work including fully finetuned baselines across ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave datasets, showing better scaling with fewer labels.

Conclusion: Primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it promising for low-label applications in primate behavior research.

Abstract: Non-human primates are our closest living relatives, and analyzing their behavior is central to research in cognition, evolution, and conservation. Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications. Code, models, and the majority of the dataset will be made available.

TL;DR: First automated method for classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images using ordinal regression with soft labels to handle annotator uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phonotrauma severity assessment relies on costly clinician judgment with variable reliability, limiting large-scale studies and consistent patient care.

Method: Modified ordinal regression framework with novel loss functions that operate on soft labels representing annotator rating distributions to account for label uncertainty.

Result: Achieves predictive performance approaching clinical experts while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Automated phonotrauma severity assessment enables large-scale studies, improving clinical understanding and patient care.

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

TL;DR: SliderEdit enables continuous, fine-grained control over individual instructions in multi-instruction image editing by exposing each instruction as an adjustable slider, overcoming the limitation of fixed-strength edits in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction-based image editing models apply each instruction with fixed strength, limiting users' ability to precisely control the intensity of individual edits. There's a need for continuous, fine-grained control over edit parameters.

Method: SliderEdit disentangles individual instructions from multi-part prompts and exposes each as a globally trained slider. It learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions, enabling continuous interpolation while preserving spatial locality and semantic consistency.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art models like FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, SliderEdit shows substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. It enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while maintaining both spatial locality and global semantic consistency.

Conclusion: SliderEdit is the first framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models, paving the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Result: Model effectively captures crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings, reduces computational load through selective frame sampling while maintaining essential crowd events, as validated by qualitative/quantitative evaluations including MAE.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring that successfully adapts image-based algorithms to handle temporal aspects of video analysis.

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

Motivation: Address limitations of existing vision-based indoor localization methods like PALMS, which suffer from short-range smartphone LiDAR constraints and ambiguity in indoor layouts, particularly for emergency response and assistive navigation applications.

Method: Reconstructs scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using Depth Pro foundation model, then performs geometric layout matching via convolution with floor plans to output location and orientation posteriors.

Result: Outperforms PALMS and F3Loc on Structured3D and custom campus dataset (80 observations across 4 buildings) in stationary localization accuracy without training. Achieved lower errors in sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories when integrated with particle filter.

Conclusion: PALMS+ demonstrates robust infrastructure-free indoor localization suitable for camera-free tracking applications, offering improved accuracy over existing methods while requiring no training.

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances Social LSTM with a Dynamic Occupied Space loss function to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction by reducing collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pedestrian trajectory prediction models treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space each person occupies, leading to unrealistic collisions in crowded environments.

Method: Enhances Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function that combines average displacement error with a collision penalty sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. Uses five datasets from real pedestrian trajectories with varying density conditions.

Result: Achieves up to 31% reduction in collision rate and reduces average displacement error by 5% and final displacement error by 6% on average across all datasets compared to baseline. Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by incorporating physical space considerations, leading to more realistic and accurate pedestrian trajectory predictions in dynamic crowded environments.

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

TL;DR: Medical foundation models outperform general-domain models for chest X-ray analysis, especially in linear probing, but their effectiveness is task-dependent with limitations in segmenting subtle pathologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-training domain, paradigm, and architecture influence embedding quality for selecting optimal encoders for radiology tasks.

Method: Evaluated vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain foundation models for chest X-ray analysis using linear probing and fine-tuning on classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) tasks.

Result: Medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, showing superior initial feature quality. However, all FMs performed poorly for segmenting subtle pathologies without significant fine-tuning. Text-image alignment was not essential, with image-only and label-supervised FMs performing well.

Conclusion: Medical pre-training is beneficial but architectural choices are critical. Pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain competitive alternatives.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

*Mahsa Mitcheff,Siamul Karim Khan,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new iris image augmentation method that manipulates specific iris attributes while preserving identity by traversing a generative model's latent space guided by differentiable feature gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for diverse iris datasets with realistic variations and anomalies to develop reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods, while addressing the challenge of synthesizing same-identity iris images with controlled attributes.

Method: Latent space traversal guided by gradients of specific iris features (sharpness, pupil size, iris size, pupil-to-iris ratio) using either pre-trained GAN models or real images via GAN inversion, with differentiable loss terms to manipulate attributes while preserving identity.

Result: The approach successfully synthesizes same-identity iris images with manipulated attributes, providing a flexible augmentation strategy that can be extended to any differentiable feature.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective iris image augmentation strategy that enables controlled attribute manipulation while maintaining identity consistency, with potential applications in iris recognition and presentation attack detection.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STORM is an annotation-free 6D pose estimation system that combines vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching for robust real-time tracking without manual segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods require labor-intensive manual annotation of target segmentation masks in the first frame, which reduces performance under occlusions or rapid movement.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention identifies candidate regions, and segmentation produces precise masks. Includes automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets with multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

Conclusion: Annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing practical solution for flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control applications.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

*Siddeshwar Raghavan,Jiangpeng He,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA is a patch-and-distribution-aware augmentation framework that addresses dual-level imbalances in exemplar-free continual learning by amplifying low-frequency classes and smoothing inter-task imbalances using CLIP encoder and adaptive balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data streams exhibit dual-level imbalances (dataset-level distributions with extreme skews within tasks), creating intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder learning and generalization in exemplar-free continual learning.

Method: Uses CLIP encoder to identify representative regions from low-frequency classes and transplants them into frequent-class samples; incorporates adaptive balancing strategy leveraging prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances.

Result: Extensive experiments show PANDA improves accuracy and reduces catastrophic forgetting when integrated with existing pre-trained model-based continual learning methods.

Conclusion: PANDA effectively addresses dual-level imbalances in exemplar-free continual learning, enhancing performance and reducing forgetting through patch-level augmentation and distribution-aware balancing.

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

*Konstantinos M. Dafnis,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STS is a lightweight test-time adaptation method for VLMs that steers latent representations using spectral subspaces without backpropagation, achieving faster inference and smaller memory footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods for VLMs require backpropagation through large encoders or alter core components, making them computationally expensive and impractical.

Method: Extracts spectral subspace from textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions, learns to steer latent representations by adapting per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views, operates entirely in latent space without backpropagation.

Result: STS surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art methods, achieves 8x faster inference speed and 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Conclusion: STS provides an efficient and effective test-time adaptation framework for VLMs that operates without modifying frozen encoders while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

*Hanzhou Liu,Peng Jiang,Jia Huang,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumos3D is a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration that directly reconstructs normal-light 3D scenes from unposed multi-view images without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D low-light restoration methods depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, limiting their scalability to dynamic real-world environments.

Method: Built on a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D uses cross-illumination distillation where a teacher network trained on normal-light data transfers geometric information to the student model, plus a dedicated Lumos loss for photometric consistency.

Result: Experiments show Lumos3D achieves high-fidelity 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases, and can also handle over-exposure correction.

Conclusion: Lumos3D provides a versatile framework for diverse lighting restoration tasks with strong generalization capabilities and feed-forward inference.

Abstract: Restoring 3D scenes captured under low-light con- ditions remains a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view retrieval methods require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on specialized images, limiting real-world deployment. Need for scalable, training-free approaches.

Method: Extracts geographic cues from monocular street-view images via web search and LLM location inference, generates satellite queries through geocoding API, and retrieves matches using DINOv2 with PCA-based whitening feature refinement.

Result: Outperforms prior learning-based approaches on benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings without ground-truth supervision or finetuning. Enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed framework provides effective cross-view retrieval without training, offers scalable dataset construction alternative, and demonstrates strong zero-shot performance compared to supervised methods.

Abstract: Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

TL;DR: A novel framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for animating humans in 3D scenes, enabling geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering without requiring paired human-scene data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis but remains unexplored for human-scene animation and interaction. Existing methods use meshes or point clouds, which have limitations for realistic human-scene interactions.

Method: Decouples rendering from motion synthesis using Gaussian-aligned motion module with opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures. Includes human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization for realistic contact and navigation.

Result: Successfully evaluated on Scannet++ and SuperSplat scenes with avatars from sparse/dense multi-view capture. Enables geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular videos with new animated humans.

Conclusion: 3DGS provides unique advantages for monocular video-based human animation, offering a flexible framework for realistic human-scene interactions without paired training data.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CertMask is a certifiably robust defense against adversarial patch attacks that uses a single round of masking with O(n) complexity, improving certified accuracy by up to 13.4% over prior methods while maintaining clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patch attacks pose serious risks to real-world vision systems, and existing defenses like PatchCleanser have high computational costs (O(n²)) requiring two masking rounds.

Method: CertMask constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each patch location is covered at least k times, performing only single-round masking with O(n) complexity.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4% over PatchCleanser while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Conclusion: CertMask provides an efficient and certifiably robust defense against adversarial patch attacks with strong theoretical guarantees and significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space weather poses growing risks to satellites and ground infrastructure, but automated classification of solar wind structures is challenging due to variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field.

Method: Adapted a foundation model trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery to create embeddings, concatenated with spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity using Fourier features in a neural field-based model, fine-tuned with Parker Solar Probe measurements.

Result: Overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, but demonstrates feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for solar wind tasks.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study lays groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions, with code and configuration files publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds are widely used in AR and robotics where relighting and texture editing require accurate albedo-shade separation, but conventional image-based models fail due to non-grid structure and lack of global-light consideration.

Method: Proposed IPCD-Net with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid processing and Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD) with hierarchical feature refinement to capture global-light direction via multi-view projection.

Result: IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade, demonstrated on synthetic outdoor-scene dataset with applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration.

Conclusion: IPCD-Net effectively addresses point cloud decomposition challenges and shows real-world applicability for various computer vision tasks requiring albedo-shade separation.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

TL;DR: T-DRS is an inference-only method that addresses progressive attention decay in LVLMs using three strategies to enhance long-range dependency modeling without harming local inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs using ROPE suffer from progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, impairing global context memory despite precise position modeling.

Method: Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies: (1) SD-DRS amplifies semantically meaningful distant signals, (2) DC-DRS modulates attention weights based on positional distances, (3) reRD-DRS reinforces remaining informative remote dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQA benchmarks show consistent performance improvements in a training-free manner.

Conclusion: T-DRS effectively recovers suppressed long-range token pairs while preserving local inductive biases, enhancing LVLM performance without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of SAM to RGB-D VSOD faces challenges: manual prompt dependence, high memory consumption from sequential adapters, and computational burden of memory attention.

Method: Uses depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a multi-modal image encoder for prompt-free fine-tuning, and query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module that unifies memory bank and prompt embeddings using frame-level and video-level queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three RGB-D VSOD datasets show SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ effectively addresses the limitations of direct SAM application to RGB-D VSOD by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal information in a unified framework.

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic scene completion methods use dense architectures with high parameter counts, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands.

Method: Proposes RWKV-PCSSC with RWKV Seed Generator to aggregate features from partial point clouds and RWKV Point Deconvolution modules to progressively restore point-wise features through multiple stages.

Result: Reduces parameter count by 4.18× and improves memory efficiency by 1.37× compared to PointSSC, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight design effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches while maintaining high performance in semantic scene completion tasks.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to generate a complete semantic scene from an incomplete input. Existing approaches often employ dense network architectures with a high parameter count, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose RWKV-PCSSC, a lightweight point cloud semantic scene completion network inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a RWKV Seed Generator (RWKV-SG) module that can aggregate features from a partial point cloud to produce a coarse point cloud with coarse features. Subsequently, the point-wise feature of the point cloud is progressively restored through multiple stages of the RWKV Point Deconvolution (RWKV-PD) modules. By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation.

### [88] [HCC-3D: Hierarchical Compensatory Compression for 98% 3D Token Reduction in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09883)
*Liheng Zhang,Jin Wang,Hui Li,Bingfeng Zhang,Weifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCC-3D is a hierarchical compression method for 3D Vision-Language Models that reduces computational costs by 98% while maintaining performance through global structure compression and adaptive detail mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-VLMs have high computational costs due to processing all 3D tokens in LLMs, limiting their practical applications. The goal is to reduce computational overhead while preserving essential 3D information.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) with two modules: Global Structure Compression (GSC) using global queries to compress 3D tokens into key tokens, and Adaptive Detail Mining (ADM) that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring.

Result: Achieves extreme compression ratios (~98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs while achieving new state-of-the-art performance, showing improvements in both efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: HCC-3D successfully addresses the computational bottleneck in 3D-VLMs by compressing 3D tokens efficiently while maintaining critical information, enabling practical applications with superior performance.

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

*Jinfu Li,Yuqi Huang,Hong Song,Ting Wang,Jianghan Xia,Yucong Lin,Jingfan Fan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) to improve tiny object detection in aerial images by addressing feature degradation and imbalanced regression penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern detectors struggle with tiny objects in aerial images due to limited features being degraded during network propagation and disproportionate regression penalties favoring larger objects.

Method: SARL uses cross-scale spatial-channel attention to enrich features and strengthen cross-layer sharing. SAL dynamically assigns lower weights to larger objects in IoU-based losses to focus training on tiny objects.

Result: Boosts generalization by 5.5% AP on YOLOv5 and YOLOx baselines across AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0, and VisDrone2019 benchmarks. Achieves 29.0% AP on noisy AI-TOD-v2.0 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed SARL and SAL effectively address tiny object detection challenges and demonstrate strong generalization and robustness across various aerial image datasets.

Abstract: Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

TL;DR: Proposes Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution for Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection, using temporal modeling and liquid neural networks to simulate continuous domain shifts and improve generalization to unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Single-DGOD methods use discrete data augmentation or static perturbations, which fail to capture the continuous and gradual nature of real-world domain shifts like weather or lighting changes, limiting fine-grained cross-domain perception.

Method: Uses controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring for initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters for smooth continuous domain adaptation.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness to unseen domain shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed LTFE method effectively bridges source-unknown domain distribution gaps by capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, significantly boosting generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

Result: Created MosaicDoc with 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, featuring bilingual content, complex layouts, and serving as definitive VRDU benchmark. Evaluation reveals current model limitations.

Conclusion: MosaicDoc establishes new standard for VRDU evaluation, revealing model limitations with real-world document complexity and providing clear direction for future research.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

TL;DR: SLDC introduces linear and weakly nonlinear transition operators to compensate for distribution drift in sequential fine-tuning for class-incremental learning, achieving performance comparable to joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential fine-tuning of ViTs suffers from distribution drift due to sequential optimization, causing mismatch between learned class distributions and the updater model, degrading classifier performance over time.

Method: Proposes Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC) with linear and weakly nonlinear variants that learn transition operators to align feature distributions across tasks, combined with knowledge distillation to reduce representation drift.

Result: Extensive experiments show SLDC significantly improves SeqFT performance, achieving comparable results to joint training across all evaluated datasets when combined with knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: SLDC effectively mitigates distribution drift in sequential fine-tuning for CIL, enabling performance competitive with joint training through drift compensation and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes a debiased dual-invariant defense framework for person ReID that addresses model bias and composite generalization requirements through data balancing and bi-adversarial self-meta defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person ReID models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing defenses fail to address the unique challenges of metric learning tasks like ReID, particularly model bias and composite generalization requirements.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Data balancing using diffusion-model-based resampling for fairness and diversity; 2) Bi-adversarial self-meta defense with metric adversarial training and farthest negative extension softening, plus adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism for dual generalization.

Result: Experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses against adversarial attacks on person ReID.

Conclusion: The proposed debiased dual-invariant defense framework effectively addresses the unique challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID, achieving superior robustness through data balancing and advanced adversarial training techniques.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: AdaptViG establishes a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs, demonstrating superior performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with semi-transparent surfaces due to its assumption of single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible through transparency.

Method: Uniformly samples transmittance to model pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, progressively fuses truncated signed distance functions to reconstruct external and internal surfaces separately.

Result: Significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes, as shown in experiments on public and self-collected datasets.

Conclusion: TSPE-GS provides a unified framework that generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead, effectively resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity in semi-transparent scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive fusion framework that enhances CLIP-based NR-IQA by combining cosine similarity with magnitude-aware quality cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP-based IQA methods only use semantic similarity between image embeddings and text prompts, overlooking the important quality cue from CLIP image feature magnitudes which empirically correlate with perceptual quality.

Method: Extracts absolute CLIP image features, applies Box-Cox transformation for statistical normalization, and uses confidence-guided fusion to adaptively combine magnitude cues with cosine similarity.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets show the method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The magnitude of CLIP image features provides a valuable quality cue that, when properly normalized and fused with semantic similarity, significantly improves NR-IQA performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models offer zero-shot object detection but have high latency and hallucination issues, making them unsuitable for direct deployment in autonomous driving where manual labeling is expensive.

Method: Leverage VLMs to generate pseudo-labels and use per-object co-teaching where two YOLO models collaboratively filter noisy bounding boxes based on peer loss values during training.

Result: Achieved mAP@0.5 boost from 31.12% to 46.61% on KITTI dataset, with further improvement to 57.97% when adding 10% ground truth labels. Similar gains observed on ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

TL;DR: DiVE preserves geometric structure in vision-language models during fine-tuning by equalizing difference vectors between pre-trained and fine-tuned embeddings, maintaining strong OOD and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust fine-tuning methods distort the geometric structure of embeddings, which is crucial for generalization in vision-language models, leading to limited OOD and zero-shot performance.

Method: Propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE) with two losses: average vector loss (AVL) for global geometric structure preservation and pairwise vector loss (PVL) for local multimodal alignment consistency.

Result: DiVE effectively preserves geometric structure and achieves strong results across in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and zero-shot metrics.

Conclusion: DiVE successfully fine-tunes vision-language models on ID data without compromising OOD and zero-shot generalization by preserving the geometric structure of embeddings.

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

Method: Proposes STELLAR with language-adaptive glyph encoder and multi-stage training (pre-training on synthetic data then fine-tuning on real images), constructs STIPLAR dataset, and introduces Text Appearance Similarity (TAS) metric for style preservation evaluation.

Result: STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over baselines.

Conclusion: STELLAR effectively addresses key limitations in scene text editing by enabling reliable multilingual editing through adaptive encoding and multi-stage training, while providing better evaluation through the novel TAS metric.

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

*Saket S. Chaturvedi,Gaurav Bagwe,Lan Zhang,Pan He,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBA introduces a material-oriented backdoor attack framework for LiDAR-based 3D object detection that bridges the digital-physical gap by modeling material properties, achieving 93.50% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks lack physical realizability due to digital-to-physical domain gaps and unoptimized physical triggers that are either ineffective or easily detectable.

Method: Systematic material selection (TiO2 for high reflectivity) and novel simulation pipeline with angle-independent Oren-Nayar BRDF model and distance-aware scaling for realistic LiDAR intensity simulation.

Result: Achieves 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41% on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models.

Conclusion: Reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the need for defenses accounting for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBGroup is a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that uses scene-level annotations to reduce labeling costs while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing weakly supervised methods (one-click and bounding box annotations) that are still labor-intensive, complex, and require expert annotators.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Dual-Branch Point Grouping with semantic/mask cues from multi-view images, plus refinement strategies (Granularity-Aware Instance Merging, Semantic Selection and Propagation); (2) Multi-round self-training with Instance Mask Filter to handle pseudo-label inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods and surpasses state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: DBGroup provides an efficient and scalable alternative for 3D instance segmentation using scene-level annotations, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

TL;DR: LampQ is a layer-wise mixed precision quantization method for Vision Transformers that addresses limitations of existing methods through fine-grained control, type-aware sensitivity metrics, and optimal bit allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods for Vision Transformers use uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of different ViT components to quantization. Previous mixed precision methods suffer from coarse granularity, metric scale mismatch, and quantization-unaware bit allocation.

Method: LampQ performs layer-wise quantization with fine-grained control, uses a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity, assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming, and iteratively updates them.

Result: Extensive experiments show LampQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks including image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Conclusion: LampQ overcomes the limitations of existing mixed precision quantization methods for Vision Transformers by providing accurate layer-wise quantization with optimal bit allocation.

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical image interpretation including annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints, particularly in complex domains like tongue diagnosis.

Method: Combines self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) for visual representation learning, graph attention networks (GAT) for label correlation modeling, constraint-aware optimization with KL divergence, and imbalance mitigation using asymmetric loss and boosting ensembles.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TongueAtlas-4K benchmark (4,000 images with 22 diagnostic labels), the largest public dataset in tongue analysis.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses key challenges in medical image analysis and generalizes well to broader diagnostic imaging tasks beyond tongue diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning task requiring agents to predict spatial location, motion type, and motion axis for affordance elements based on task instructions, solved by AffordBot framework integrating MLLMs with CoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack coherent instruction-driven grounding and reasoning for fine-grained affordance in physical environments, operating at object level or disjointedly handling affordance reasoning.

Method: AffordBot integrates MLLMs with tailored CoT reasoning, renders surround-view images from 3D point clouds, projects 3D element candidates into views, and uses active perception to select informative viewpoints before step-by-step reasoning for localization and motion inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SceneFun3D dataset, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively bridges 3D input with 2D-compatible MLLMs, enabling fine-grained embodied reasoning for human-agent collaboration in physical environments.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic anomalies without requiring exemplar anomaly data, enabling better training of anomaly detection models through synthetic anomaly generation.

Method: Uses crossmodal prompt encoding to unify visual and textual cues, an inpainting-based generation pipeline, and contrastive refinement for precise anomaly-mask alignment. Trained on AnomVerse dataset with 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets from 13 public datasets.

Result: Generates more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, leading to superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: Anomagic establishes a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation that can create anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

Conclusion: The dual-guided paradigm effectively addresses hard instance detection challenges in 3D object detection, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to single-guided approaches.

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel 3D VAE framework using unsigned distance fields (UDFs) with local-to-global architecture enables high-fidelity 3D content generation for complex topologies at ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing methods: SDFs require costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities.

Method: 3D VAE framework based on UDFs with local-to-global architecture that partitions UDF into uniform subvolumes (UBlocks), combining 3D convolutions for local detail and sparse transformers for global coherence, plus Pad-Average strategy for smooth boundary transitions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, achieving superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility at previously unattainable ultra-high resolutions.

Conclusion: The proposed UDF-based 3D VAE with local-to-global architecture successfully handles complex topologies and enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions, overcoming fundamental limitations of existing 3D representation methods.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visible-infrared detection methods suffer from information imbalance between modalities and inadequate cross-modal fusion, while ignoring the potential of frequency domain transformers for mining complementary information.

Method: Proposes multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to capture complementary information, frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) with mixed-scale fusion, cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) for pixel-wise interaction, and local feature enhancement module (LFEM) with convolution layers and channel shuffle.

Result: Extensive experiments show FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency domain fusion transformer effectively addresses modality imbalance and enhances cross-modal feature fusion for improved visible-infrared object detection.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuSc-V2 is a zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation framework that leverages the property that normal patches find similar neighbors while anomalies remain isolated, using mutual scoring across 2D/3D modalities to achieve significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot methods overlook that normal image patches across industrial products typically find many similar patches in both 2D appearance and 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. This discriminative property can be explicitly leveraged for better anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes Mutual Scoring framework with: Iterative Point Grouping for improved 3D representation, Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees for multi-scale patch features, Mutual Scoring Mechanism for intra-modal scoring, Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement to fuse 2D/3D scores, and Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood to suppress false positives.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements: +23.7% AP gain on MVTec 3D-AD dataset and +19.3% boost on Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and outperforming most few-shot methods.

Conclusion: MuSc-V2 provides a flexible framework for zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation that works on both full datasets and smaller subsets, ensuring robust performance across diverse product lines by leveraging mutual scoring across 2D/3D modalities.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the poor performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image screening by creating a comprehensive dataset and developing an enhanced training method called HCM-GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image screening performance with MLLMs is unsatisfactory due to lack of data and weak image aesthetic reasoning ability. Current state-of-the-art MLLMs perform like random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning tasks.

Method: Collected a large dataset (128k samples, 640k images) evaluating four aesthetic aspects. Developed HCM-GRPO method combining Hard Cases Mining with Dynamic Proportional Accuracy reward in Group Relative Policy Optimization framework.

Result: Even top closed-source MLLMs (GPT4o, Qwen-VL-Max) perform like random guessing. HCM-GRPO enables smaller models to surpass both large open-source and leading closed-source models in image aesthetic reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed solution with comprehensive dataset and HCM-GRPO method significantly improves image aesthetic reasoning capabilities, enabling smaller models to outperform much larger state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether MLLMs can identify confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent, and address the issue of visually dominated reasoning that causes failures in such scenarios.

Method: Proposes RL-CoMM with two stages: 1) Uses Large Audio Language Model as reference for audio-only reasoning with Step-wise Reasoning Reward for self-improvement, 2) Implements Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce uncertainty from heterogeneous reasoning differences.

Result: RL-CoMM improves accuracy by 10-30% over baseline models on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination tasks with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-CoMM framework effectively addresses visual dominance in MLLMs and significantly improves their ability to handle audio-visual confusion scenarios.

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses medical action evaluation challenges through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning and demonstrates superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

### [115] [Perceive, Act and Correct: Confidence Is Not Enough for Hyperspectral Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10068)
*Muzhou Yang,Wuzhou Quan,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CABIN is a semi-supervised framework that addresses overconfidence in hyperspectral image classification by incorporating uncertainty estimation and dynamic pseudo-label correction to improve generalization under sparse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models in hyperspectral image classification often mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking uncertainty awareness, leading to confirmation bias and poor generalization under sparse annotations or class imbalance.

Method: CABIN uses a closed-loop learning process with: 1) perceptual awareness through epistemic uncertainty estimation, 2) uncertainty-guided dual sampling for exploration and stable pseudo-labels, and 3) fine-grained dynamic assignment strategy to categorize and correct noisy pseudo-labels with tailored losses.

Result: Experimental results show that state-of-the-art methods benefit from CABIN integration, achieving improved labeling efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: CABIN effectively addresses overconfidence issues in hyperspectral image classification by incorporating cognitive-aware learning that balances exploration and exploitation through uncertainty-guided strategies.

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

*Gwangyeon Ahn,Jiwan Seo,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLF-MSC is a unified multimodal semantic communication system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver, improving spectral efficiency and robustness to channel noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication techniques process each modality separately, requiring modality-specific streams or retransmissions, which reduces spectral efficiency and adaptability.

Method: Uses a pre-trained vision-language model to encode source images into vision-language semantic features (VLF), transmitted over wireless channels. At receiver, decoder-based language model and diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on VLF to generate text and images.

Result: Outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

Conclusion: VLF-MSC provides an efficient unified framework for multimodal semantic communication that eliminates modality-specific streams while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness to channel noise.

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

### [117] [Mitigating Error Accumulation in Co-Speech Motion Generation via Global Rotation Diffusion and Multi-Level Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10076)
*Xiangyue Zhang,Jianfang Li,Jianqiang Ren,Jiaxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlobalDiff is a diffusion-based framework that generates co-speech motion using global joint rotations instead of hierarchical local rotations, preventing cumulative errors through multi-level structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using hierarchical local joint rotations suffer from cumulative errors causing unstable motions at end-effectors. Global rotations can decouple joint predictions and eliminate hierarchical error accumulation.

Method: Proposes GlobalDiff framework operating in global joint rotation space with three constraints: joint structure constraint using virtual anchor points, skeleton structure constraint for angular consistency, and temporal structure constraint with multi-scale variational encoder.

Result: Extensive evaluations show GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, achieving 46.0% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods across multiple speaker identities.

Conclusion: Operating directly in global rotation space with multi-level constraints effectively addresses hierarchical error accumulation and generates more reliable co-speech motions.

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

### [118] [GridPrune: From "Where to Look" to "What to Select" in Visual Token Pruning for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10081)
*Yuxiang Duan,Ao Li,Yingqin Li,Luyu Li,Pengwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune is a visual token pruning method for MLLMs that uses a two-stage "guide-globally, select-locally" approach to efficiently allocate attention across spatial zones before fine-grained selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods focus only on "what to select" using attention scores, leading to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and retention of irrelevant tokens. Human visual cognition uses a two-stage strategy of first determining "where to look" before "what to select".

Method: GridPrune splits pruning into two steps: 1) text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate token budgets across spatial zones, and 2) local selection within each budgeted zone, replacing the global Top-K mechanism.

Result: On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of full performance while using only 11.1% of tokens, outperforming the best baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate across various MLLM architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system effectively addresses spatial allocation inefficiencies in visual token pruning, achieving superior performance by mimicking human visual attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUGAR combines LLMs with human skeleton data for action recognition by using video models to generate visual-motion knowledge, supervising skeleton learning, and leveraging LLMs for classification and description without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to understand and classify human actions from skeleton data by addressing how LLMs can comprehend skeleton representations and distinguish between different actions.

Method: SUGAR pipeline: 1) Use off-the-shelf video models to generate visual-motion knowledge, 2) Supervise skeleton learning with this prior knowledge to create discrete representations, 3) Apply pre-trained LLMs to understand these representations for action classification/description, 4) Temporal Query Projection module for long sequence modeling.

Result: SUGAR achieves strong performance on multiple skeleton-based action classification benchmarks and demonstrates superior versatility in zero-shot scenarios compared to linear-based methods.

Conclusion: The SUGAR framework effectively bridges LLMs with skeleton data for action recognition, showing promising results in both standard and zero-shot settings through knowledge transfer from visual-motion information.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTAttack is a multi-target backdoor attack framework for Large Visual Language Models that enables multiple independent triggers to map to different malicious outputs in a single training pass, overcoming feature interference challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs only focus on single-target attacks, but multi-target attacks pose greater real-world threats. However, executing such attacks is challenging due to feature interference among different triggers.

Method: Proposed MTAttack with two novel constraints: Proxy Space Partitioning and Trigger Prototype Anchoring, which jointly optimize multiple triggers in latent space to independently map clean images to unique proxy classes while ensuring separability.

Result: Experiments show high success rate for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing methods. The attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against defense strategies.

Conclusion: LVLMs are vulnerable to multi-target backdoor attacks, highlighting urgent need for mitigation strategies against such threats.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

TL;DR: RobIA: A robust, instance-aware framework for continual test-time adaptation in stereo depth estimation that dynamically adapts to domain shifts using parameter-efficient modules and pseudo-supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in stereo depth estimation including dynamic domain shifts, sparse supervision, and high cost of dense ground-truth labels, while overcoming limitations of existing TTA methods that assume static target domains.

Method: Integrates Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE) for dynamic input routing via lightweight self-attention, and Robust AdaptBN Teacher for dense pseudo-supervision using PEFT-based teacher model to complement sparse labels.

Result: Achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating improved generalization under domain shift.

Conclusion: RobIA provides an effective solution for continual test-time adaptation in stereo depth estimation with input-specific flexibility and broad supervision coverage.

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: CACMI is a novel dense video captioning framework that explicitly models temporal coherence and semantic context through cross-modal interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on implicit modeling with frame-level features, failing to capture temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive visual semantics.

Method: Proposes Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI) with two components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation for event-aligned textual features via cross-modal retrieval, and Context-aware Feature Enhancement using query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in dense video captioning.

Conclusion: CACMI effectively addresses limitations of implicit modeling by explicitly capturing temporal coherence and semantic context, achieving superior dense video captioning results.

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

*Mayank Vatsa,Aparna Bharati,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-image models fail at logical composition (negation, counting, spatial relations) due to training data gaps, architectural limitations, and flawed evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why current text-to-image models struggle with logical composition despite good performance on individual primitives, exposing fundamental architectural flaws.

Method: Survey analysis across three core logical primitives (negation, counting, spatial relations) using recent benchmarks and methods to identify failure patterns and root causes.

Result: Models show dramatic performance collapse when combining logical primitives, with severe interference effects. Training data lacks explicit negations, attention architectures are unsuitable for discrete logic, and metrics prioritize visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: Genuine compositionality requires fundamental advances in representation and reasoning, not incremental adjustments to existing architectures or simple scaling.

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a split-layer architecture for implicit neural representations that enhances representational capacity by dividing MLP layers into parallel branches and combining them via Hadamard product, achieving better performance across multiple tasks without prohibitive computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit neural representations (INR) have limited representational capacity due to low-dimensional feature spaces in conventional MLP architectures, and widening MLPs leads to quadratic growth in computational and memory costs.

Method: Proposes split-layer architecture that divides each MLP layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs using Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space to expand feature dimensionality.

Result: Extensive experiments show the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods in 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The split-layer approach successfully enhances INR's representational capacity without prohibitive computational overhead, demonstrating superior performance across diverse applications.

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-mechanism framework that improves fairness in deepfake detection without sacrificing accuracy through structural decoupling and distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness-enhanced detectors often compromise detection accuracy to improve fairness, creating a trade-off that limits practical deployment in digital identity security.

Method: Integrates structural fairness decoupling (demographic-sensitive channel separation) and global distribution alignment (reducing distance between overall and demographic group feature distributions).

Result: Experimental results show improved inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the fairness-accuracy trade-off in deepfake detection, enabling more equitable deployment in digital identity security applications.

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

TL;DR: GEA proposes a generative approach for text-to-image person retrieval using diffusion-generated images as intermediate representations to bridge the modality gap between text and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual queries often fail to accurately reflect image content, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting. The inherent modality gap between text and image makes accurate retrieval challenging.

Method: Two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE) uses diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations, and (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF) combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features with triplet alignment loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: GEA successfully addresses modality gap issues in text-to-image person retrieval through generative intermediate representations, improving cross-modal alignment performance.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: Real-world images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously (rain, noise, haze), but most existing methods target only single degradation types. Current approaches also suffer from limited interpretability when stacking modules for performance improvement.

Method: Deep unfolding network mapping iterative optimization algorithm into learnable structure. Uses improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm for physical interpretability. Includes explainable convolution module inspired by human brain's flexible information processing and image characteristics.

Result: InterIR demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretability-driven approach successfully addresses multi-degradation image restoration with clear physical interpretability and maintains strong performance across both multi-degradation and single-degradation scenarios.

Abstract: Although image restoration has advanced significantly, most existing methods target only a single type of degradation. In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

In particular, it exceeded the strongest baseline, the attention-driven AFPF-Net (MRE = 1.25 mm, SDR @ 2.0 mm = 84.1%), while using less than 25% of its parameters. These results demonstrate that CephRes-MHNet attains state-of-the-art accuracy through architectural efficiency, providing a practical solution for real-world orthodontic analysis.

Abstract: We present an initial evaluation of NASA and IBM's Prithvi-EO-2.0 geospatial foundation model on shoreline delineation of small sandy islands using satellite images. We curated and labeled a dataset of 225 multispectral images of two Maldivian islands, which we publicly release, and fine-tuned both the 300M and 600M parameter versions of Prithvi on training subsets ranging from 5 to 181 images. Our experiments show that even with as few as 5 training images, the models achieve high performance (F1 of 0.94, IoU of 0.79). Our results demonstrate the strong transfer learning capability of Prithvi, underscoring the potential of such models to support coastal monitoring in data-poor regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA is a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory prediction that combines long-term intent modeling, social interaction modeling, and interpretable attention mechanisms to generate realistic, collision-free trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and fine-grained social interactions, leading to unrealistic multi-agent futures in dense, interactive environments.

Method: VISTA uses: (i) cross-attention fusion module for integrating long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling, and (iii) pairwise attention maps for interpretable social influence patterns.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on MADRAS and SDD benchmarks, reducing collision rate from 2.14% to 0.03% on MADRAS and attaining zero collisions on SDD while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE metrics.

Conclusion: VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiNeXt is a lightweight non-diffusion network for 3D LiDAR scene completion that achieves 199.8x speedup over diffusion methods while improving accuracy and reducing parameters by 93.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for LiDAR scene completion suffer from high computational overhead due to multi-step iterative sampling, limiting real-time applicability in autonomous vehicles.

Method: Uses Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module for single-pass denoising instead of iterative sampling, Refine Module for precise refinement, and Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to handle LiDAR's distance-dependent spatial distribution.

Result: Achieves 199.8x inference speedup, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% parameters compared to LiDiff on SemanticKITTI dataset.

Conclusion: LiNeXt demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness for real-time scene completion, making it suitable for autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.

TL;DR: HeatV2X is a scalable V2X collaborative perception framework that addresses multi-modal heterogeneity and scalability challenges through efficient fine-tuning methods, achieving superior performance with minimal training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X frameworks struggle with multi-modal heterogeneity across agents and lack scalability for accommodating new agents, making full-parameter training impractical.

Method: Uses heterogeneous graph attention to train a foundation agent, then applies Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning with Hetero-Aware Adapters and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning with Multi-Cognitive Adapter for effective alignment and collaboration.

Result: Achieves superior perception performance on OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: HeatV2X provides an effective solution for scalable V2X collaborative perception that handles agent heterogeneity while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal deepfake detection methods struggle with generalization across unseen manipulations and datasets, require pretraining on real samples, and may fail against manipulations preserving audio-visual alignment by overlooking intra-modal artifacts.

Method: Single-stage training framework incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features, with window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames for detecting local artifacts.

Result: The model demonstrates strong generalization across multiple benchmark datasets and achieves precise temporal localization of deepfake segments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses generalization limitations in multimodal deepfake detection through next-frame prediction and window-level attention, enabling robust detection and accurate localization of manipulations.

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

TL;DR: TubeRMC is a framework for weakly-supervised spatio-temporal video grounding that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes and refines them through tube-conditioned reconstruction with mutual constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly-supervised STVG methods use simple late-fusion approaches that generate tubes independent of text descriptions, leading to target identification failures and inconsistent tracking.

Method: Proposes Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (TubeRMC) that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes using pre-trained visual grounding models, then refines them through three reconstruction strategies (temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal) with mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on VidSTG and HCSTVG benchmarks, effectively mitigating both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Conclusion: TubeRMC successfully addresses limitations of previous weakly-supervised STVG methods by incorporating tube-conditioned reconstruction with mutual constraints, achieving superior performance in spatio-temporal video grounding.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQA methods lack interpretability and reliability as they predict scores from entire videos without fine-grained analysis. Current datasets also lack detailed sub-score and deduction annotations needed for comprehensive action evaluation.

Method: Segments action videos into stages and scores each stage individually. Uses stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion to handle camera viewpoint changes. Incorporates knowledge-based grade-aware decoder with deduction items as prior knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new aerial skiing benchmark dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations.

Conclusion: JudgeMind significantly enhances AQA performance and reliability by mimicking professional referees' judgment process through stage segmentation and deduction-aware scoring.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Facial-R1 is a three-stage alignment framework that addresses hallucinated reasoning and misalignment issues in Facial Emotion Analysis using instruction fine-tuning, reinforcement training, and iterative data synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models for Facial Emotion Analysis suffer from hallucinated reasoning (generating plausible but inaccurate explanations) and misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge and fragmented connections between facial features and labels.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Instruction fine-tuning for basic emotional reasoning, 2) Reinforcement training using emotion and AU labels as reward signals to align reasoning with predictions, 3) Iterative data synthesis pipeline that expands training data for scalable self-improvement.

Result: Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight standard benchmarks in Facial Emotion Analysis, with strong generalization and robust interpretability. Introduces FEA-20K dataset with 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples.

Conclusion: The proposed three-stage alignment framework effectively addresses hallucinated reasoning and misalignment challenges in Facial Emotion Analysis, enabling more accurate and explainable emotion understanding with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGVC methods fail to comprehensively capture discriminative cues while introducing category-agnostic redundancy, limiting their effectiveness in handling subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations.

Method: Proposes H3Former with Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM) that constructs weighted hypergraphs among tokens using multi-scale contextual cues, and Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL) that enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in non-Euclidean space.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of the H3Former framework over existing approaches.

Conclusion: H3Former effectively addresses limitations of previous FGVC methods by leveraging high-order semantic relations and hierarchical constraints, achieving superior performance in fine-grained visual classification tasks.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROPA is a novel framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with GRPO to generate dense process-level rewards for optimizing visual reasoning in VLMs, eliminating the need for step-level human annotations while improving reasoning stability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with complex visual reasoning where early errors cascade through multi-step dependencies. Existing methods either require costly step-level annotations (SFT) or provide only sparse outcome-level feedback (RLVR), limiting stable optimization.

Method: PROPA integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with GRPO to generate dense process-level rewards, optimizing reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. It interleaves GRPO updates with SFT to overcome cold-start problems and trains a Process Reward Model to guide inference-time search.

Result: Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines, achieving up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PROPA establishes strong reasoning and generalization capabilities for visual reasoning tasks by providing dense process-level optimization without requiring human annotations, significantly advancing complex visual reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs are impractical for blind/low-vision users due to high resource demands, creating need for smaller models that maintain description quality for accessibility.

Method: Evaluated SmolVLM2 variants on AVCaps and Charades datasets using novel BLV accessibility frameworks, tested prompt strategies, and deployed on smartphones with different precision levels.

Result: The study systematically assessed smaller VLMs' performance on accessibility metrics including spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, ambience, and navigational assistance.

Conclusion: Smaller VLMs can provide practical accessibility solutions for BLV users when deployed on resource-limited mobile devices, with appropriate evaluation frameworks and optimization.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUDDER is an efficient framework that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by using visual evidence vectors extracted during standard forward passes and adaptive token-wise injection, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time interventions for mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs often require substantial computational overhead through extra forward passes, limiting their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments.

Method: Uses two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector - a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from residual updates of self-attention layers during standard forward passes; (2) Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection with corrective signal strength conditioned on model's deviation from visual context.

Result: Extensive experiments on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency.

Conclusion: RUDDER is a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without significant efficiency compromise, making it suitable for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite-based slum segmentation can generate global urban poverty estimates, but morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements prevents models from generalizing effectively to unseen regions.

Method: Two-phase test-time adaptation framework with Mixture-of-Experts architecture that captures region-specific characteristics while learning universal features through shared backbone. Uses prediction consistency across experts to filter unreliable pseudo-labels during adaptation.

Result: GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings like African cities, using a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents.

Conclusion: GRAM provides a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning by enabling robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions.

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities in LLaVA architecture by enabling LLMs to serve as both language models and vision encoders.

Method: Three key modifications: (1) separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporation of both global and local visual representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms baseline LLaVA method on multiple benchmarks, even surpassing models with double the parameter count.

Conclusion: LLaViT establishes a more effective approach to vision-language modeling by enabling LLMs to simultaneously function as vision encoders.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes new error categories and metrics for pedestrian detection evaluation to address weaknesses in current benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art on CityPersons-reasonable with a simple architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pedestrian detection benchmarks have weaknesses that prohibit realistic performance evaluation of DNNs, and image segmentation can provide fine-grained information to distinguish between different error types.

Method: Proposes eight different error categories for pedestrian detection and new metrics for performance comparison along these categories. Uses image segmentation to automatically distinguish error types during evaluation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CityPersons-reasonable dataset without extra training data using a simple architecture. Shows more fine-grained and robust model comparison, especially for safety-critical performance.

Conclusion: The proposed error categories and metrics enable more realistic and safety-focused evaluation of pedestrian detectors, allowing better comparison of models' performance in critical scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.

### [144] [CLIP4VI-ReID: Learning Modality-shared Representations via CLIP Semantic Bridge for Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10309)
*Xiaomei Yang,Xizhan Gao,Sijie Niu,Fa Zhu,Guang Feng,Xiaofeng Qu,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP4VI-ReID is a novel network for visible-infrared person re-identification that uses text semantics as a bridge to align visible and infrared modalities through three components: text generation, infrared feature embedding, and high-level semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant modality gap between visible and infrared images in person re-identification, which makes direct cross-modal matching challenging due to different physical characteristics.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Text Semantic Generation for visible images, 2) Infrared Feature Embedding using text semantics to adapt to infrared modality, 3) High-level Semantic Alignment to refine ID-related information.

Result: Achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on widely used VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: Using text as an intermediate bridge effectively enables visible-infrared modality alignment and enhances discriminability of shared representations for person re-identification.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning network named CLIP4VI-ReID for VI-ReID task, which consists of Text Semantic Generation (TSG), Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE), and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA). Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.

*Yu Deng,Baozhu Zhao,Junyan Su,Xiaohan Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D reconstruction framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to address extreme depth variations in scenes, achieving superior depth fidelity in both near-field and far-field regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions in scenes with extreme depth variations.

Method: Two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision using scale-recovered monocular depth estimator and defocus convolution with depth-of-field loss; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision using LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching and least squares optimization.

Result: Achieves 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art method on Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating superior depth fidelity in complex urban environments.

Conclusion: This framework successfully bridges physical imaging principles with learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for handling complex depth stratification.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSANet improves weakly-supervised video anomaly detection by explicitly separating abnormal and normal features through self-guided normality modeling and decoupled contrastive semantic alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods tend to detect only the most salient anomalous segments while neglecting diverse normal patterns, and suffer from category confusion due to similar appearances, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification.

Method: Proposes DSANet with two key components: 1) Self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs video features using learned normal prototypes to separate normal patterns from anomalies; 2) Decoupled contrastive semantic alignment that temporally decomposes videos into event-centric and background-centric components and applies visual-language contrastive learning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DSANet effectively enhances the distinguishability between abnormal and normal features through explicit separation at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels, achieving superior performance in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Mengzhu Wang,Changyuan Deng,Shanshan Wang,Nan Yin,Long Lan,Liang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel SDG object detection framework combining vMF distribution modeling and Fourier transformation with CLIP guidance to improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for SDG object detection overlook feature distribution structures and frequency-domain characteristics crucial for robustness to domain shifts.

Method: Integrates von Mises-Fisher distribution to model directional features for domain-invariant semantics, and Fourier-based augmentation that perturbs amplitude/phase components to simulate domain shifts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse weather-driving benchmark, demonstrating improved feature diversity and structural consistency across domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances SDG object detection by combining semantic alignment from CLIP with structural feature modeling and frequency-domain augmentation.

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHRUG-FM is a reliability-aware prediction framework that combines OOD detection in input/embedding spaces and predictive uncertainty to identify unreliable geospatial model predictions, particularly for burn scar segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial foundation models often fail in underrepresented environments during pretraining, creating reliability gaps in real-world climate applications.

Method: Integrates three signals: OOD detection in input space, OOD detection in embedding space, and task-specific predictive uncertainty.

Result: OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, uncertainty flags help discard poor predictions, and failures concentrate in underrepresented geographies like low-elevation zones and large river areas.

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM enables safer, more interpretable deployment of geospatial foundation models by bridging benchmark performance and real-world reliability in climate-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

TL;DR: M3DSG preserves visual cues in 3D scene graphs using images instead of text, enabling MSGNav's zero-shot navigation with efficient reasoning and open vocabulary support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing zero-shot methods that compress visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible visual loss, and constrained vocabularies.

Method: Introduce Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG) with visual relational edges, and MSGNav system with Key Subgraph Selection, Adaptive Vocabulary Update, Closed-Loop Reasoning, and Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets, demonstrating superior zero-shot navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: M3DSG and MSGNav effectively address visual preservation and open vocabulary challenges in zero-shot embodied navigation, with explicit solution to the last-mile problem.

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: Current AI privacy defenses like Anti-DreamBooth are vulnerable to purification attacks, offering false security against facial identity leakage in personalized generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical limitations in existing privacy defenses for personalized AI applications, which suffer from visible artifacts and fragility against simple purification methods.

Method: Proposed AntiDB_Purify evaluation framework to systematically test existing defenses against realistic purification threats including traditional filters and adversarial purification techniques.

Result: All current defense methods fail to maintain protection effectiveness under purification threats, revealing their vulnerability and false sense of security.

Conclusion: Current defenses are inadequate, highlighting the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protection mechanisms to safeguard user identity in personalized generation systems.

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

Conclusion: SAMIRO effectively enhances lane detection performance by leveraging knowledge from pretrained models and preserving spatial information, demonstrating consistent improvements across various models and datasets.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite imagery is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OmniDocBench v1.5, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 with exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5 provides an effective unified framework for complex document parsing, demonstrating superior performance and robustness through its two-stage approach and specialized table handling modules.

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DTM generation methods require manual parameter tuning, while learning-based approaches need complex architectures and post-processing. There's a need for more effective and scalable solutions for bare-earth elevation modeling.

Method: Proposes Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff) using diffusion models to iteratively remove non-ground structures through denoising, with gated design and confidence-guided generation. Also introduces Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch) for scalability using downsampled global priors.

Result: Achieves up to 93% RMSE reduction on ALS2DTM and 47% on USGS benchmarks. For road reconstruction, achieves 81% lower distance error on GeRoD benchmark while maintaining competitive smoothness. GrounDiff+ variant further improves surface smoothness.

Conclusion: GrounDiff demonstrates that diffusion models are highly effective for DTM generation, providing superior performance across multiple benchmarks without task-specific optimization, offering a scalable solution for geospatial applications.

Abstract: Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) represent the bare-earth elevation and are important in numerous geospatial applications. Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault detection methods are limited to visual recognition with structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making.

Method: Combines YOLOMS (multi-scale detection with sliding-window cropping) with a lightweight KV mapping module to convert visual outputs to structured text, then uses a domain-tuned LLM for semantic reasoning.

Result: Achieves 90.6% fault detection accuracy and generates maintenance reports with 89% average accuracy on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves diagnostic interpretability and provides practical decision support for wind turbine operation and maintenance.

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Conclusion: Both GT++ and 3DFETUS effectively automate and standardize facial plane localization in 3D fetal ultrasound, improving accuracy and addressing current clinical challenges.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research by providing a standardized dataset for automatic seizure detection in rodents.

Method: Used TimeSformer transformer-based video classifier with five-fold cross-validation and strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage.

Result: Achieved 97% average F1-score for discriminating between seizure and normal activity in rodent videos.

Conclusion: The RodEpil dataset enables reproducible research on video-based seizure detection in preclinical epilepsy studies, with publicly available data and baseline code.

Abstract: We introduce a curated video dataset of laboratory rodents for automatic detection of convulsive events. The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer). Experiments employ five-fold cross-validation with strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage (no subject appears in more than one fold). Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%. The dataset and baseline code are publicly released to support reproducible research on non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

TL;DR: HIT uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images as biologically meaningful patches for multiple-instance learning, improving cancer detection accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital pathology pipelines use grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture, introducing irrelevant information and limiting interpretability of cancer grading.

Method: Histology-informed tiling (HIT) uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images as input patches for multiple-instance learning and phenotyping.

Result: HIT achieved gland-level Dice score of 0.83, improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting CNVs, and revealed 15 gland clusters associated with cancer relapse, mutations, and high Gleason scores.

Conclusion: HIT improves accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions while streamlining computations by focusing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Abstract: We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model.

TL;DR: Automated CT imaging approach detects pancreatic surface lobularity as a biomarker for Type 2 Diabetes screening, achieving 0.90 AUC for T2DM prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Type 2 Diabetes is crucial to prevent organ damage, and while pancreas volume and fat content have been studied, the role of pancreatic surface lobularity in T2DM patients hasn't been fully investigated.

Method: Used four deep learning models to segment pancreas in 584 patients, automatically detected pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL), and developed multivariate models using CT biomarkers for T2DM prediction.

Result: PSL was significantly higher in diabetic patients (4.26±8.32 vs 3.19±3.62, p=0.01). PancAP model achieved best segmentation (Dice: 0.79±0.17, ASSD: 1.94±2.63mm). Multivariate model attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7% sensitivity, and 91.9% specificity for T2DM prediction.

Conclusion: Pancreatic surface lobularity is useful for T2DM screening and could help predict early onset of Type 2 Diabetes.

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high computational demands that scale quadratically with token count. Compact attention representations can guide early detection of less salient tokens before expensive attention computation.

Method: SPOT uses lightweight predictors that leverage token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, enabling context-aware token sparsification that can be plugged into various ViT architectures.

Result: Empirical evaluations show significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

Conclusion: SPOT provides an effective framework for token sparsification in Vision Transformers that adapts to varying resource constraints without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Total Variation (TV) depends on a fixed lambda parameter, limiting its efficiency and making it difficult to use effectively for optimal noise reduction and edge preservation.

Method: Couples an unrolled TV solver with a Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) that predicts per-pixel regularization maps. The pipeline is trained end-to-end to jointly optimize reconstruction and regularization.

Result: Experiments on DeepLesion dataset with realistic noise model show consistent gains: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average over classical TV and FBP+U-Net.

Conclusion: LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and serves as a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction.

Abstract: Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average.

TL;DR: SemanticVLA is a Vision-Language-Action framework that addresses perceptual redundancy and instruction-vision misalignment through semantic-aligned sparsification and enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from inefficient processing of irrelevant visual inputs (perceptual redundancy) and poor semantic grounding of actions due to superficial instruction-vision alignment, hindering practical robotic deployment.

Method: Three key components: 1) Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) with instruction-driven and spatial-aggregation pruners for sparsifying perception while maintaining semantic alignment; 2) Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) for integrating sparsified features across visual encoders; 3) Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) for enhanced perception-to-action transformation.

Result: SemanticVLA achieves 21.1% higher success rate than OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark while reducing training cost by 3.0-fold and inference latency by 2.7-fold, setting new state-of-the-art in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-aligned sparsification and enhancement approach effectively addresses key limitations in VLA models, enabling more efficient and interpretable robotic manipulation with superior performance across simulation and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically (neglecting distinct motion characteristics) or model scenes and backgrounds separately (causing spatial inconsistencies and artifacts at human-scene boundaries).

Method: StM strategy with dedicated information mapping mechanism using shared transformation functions for Gaussian attributes to unify separately modeled components, avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and rendering accuracy, especially at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Conclusion: The Separate-then-Map strategy effectively addresses spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts in dynamic human-scene reconstruction from monocular videos.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Motivation: Current T2I models generate homogeneous outputs despite quality improvements, highlighting the need for robust diversity evaluation methods.

Result: Enables principled ranking of T2I models by diversity and identifies specific categories where models struggle with variation.

Conclusion: Provides a robust methodology for diversity assessment that can guide improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

TL;DR: CoTyle enables generating novel, consistent visual styles using only numerical codes, eliminating the need for complex prompts or reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style generation methods rely on lengthy prompts, reference images, or fine-tuning, leading to style inconsistency, limited creativity, and complex representations.

Method: Train discrete style codebook from image collection, use embeddings to condition diffusion model, then train autoregressive style generator to synthesize novel style embeddings from numerical codes.

Result: CoTyle successfully transforms numerical codes into style controllers, generating diverse and consistent visual styles with minimal input.

Conclusion: A style can be effectively represented by a single numerical code, enabling simple yet powerful style generation through the proposed code-to-style paradigm.

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D foundation models focus on RGB-only inputs and ignore available geometric cues, limiting their performance and practical utility in vision tasks.

Method: Proposes GeoAdapter with zero-initialized convolutions to encode geometric information without disrupting the foundation model, and stochastic multimodal fusion that randomly samples modality subsets during training for robust representations.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. Enhances VLA models for robotic tasks.

Conclusion: OmniVGGT effectively leverages geometric modalities to improve 3D vision tasks and demonstrates practical utility in robotic applications through enhanced VLA models.

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

Motivation: Limited annotated DBT data constrains deep learning development, while existing methods either discard volumetric information or require complex architectures and more training data.

Method: M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features and learns 3D reasoning by repeatedly mixing these features with slice-level information, modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters for direct weight transfer from FFDM.

Result: M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification, and outperforms complex 3D variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in low-data regime.

Conclusion: M&M-3D enables effective 3D reasoning for DBT while maintaining parameter efficiency and direct weight transfer from 2D models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the BCS-DBT benchmark.

Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

Conclusion: The MSOM framework effectively addresses key challenges in Sentinel-2 land use classification by integrating object-based analysis, global-local modeling, and multitask optimization, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity).

Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with high-resolution scaling - direct sampling is slow/costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution introduces artifacts and latency by operating after decoding.

Method: A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads performs super-resolution in latent space before VAE decoding, requiring no base model modifications or additional diffusion stages.

Result: Achieves comparable perceptual quality with 3x lower decoding/upscaling time (+0.42s vs 1.87s for 1024px from 512px), strong generalization across different VAE latent spaces, and close fidelity to native high-resolution generation.

Conclusion: LUA provides a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in diffusion pipelines through latent-space super-resolution before decoding.

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth Anything 3 (DA3) is a transformer-based model that predicts consistent geometry from multiple visual inputs without requiring camera poses, achieving SOTA performance on geometry tasks while using minimal architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model that can predict spatially consistent geometry from arbitrary visual inputs without relying on known camera poses, while maintaining simplicity in architecture and training approach.

Method: Uses a single plain transformer backbone (vanilla DINO encoder) without architectural specialization, employs singular depth-ray prediction target to avoid complex multi-task learning, and follows teacher-student training paradigm.

Result: Sets new SOTA on visual geometry benchmark: 44.3% improvement in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy over prior SOTA VGGT, outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation.

Conclusion: DA3 demonstrates that minimal modeling with plain transformers and simple training targets can achieve state-of-the-art geometry prediction performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: We present Depth Anything 3 (DA3), a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from an arbitrary number of visual inputs, with or without known camera poses. In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets.

*Jiahao Wang,Weiye Xu,Aijun Yang,Wengang Zhou,Lewei Lu,Houqiang Li,Xiaohua Wang,Jinguo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) addresses the problem in outcome-reward RL where incorrect reasoning chains that happen to guess the right answer get the same reward as correct reasoning, by using visual perturbations and trajectory resampling to create a consistency score that down-weights unreliable reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current outcome-reward RL methods for multimodal LLMs have a flaw where unfaithful reasoning trajectories that guess the correct option receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which undermines the learning process in multiple-choice settings.

Method: SCS introduces small visual perturbations and performs repeated truncation and resampling of initial trajectories, then uses agreement among resulting trajectories to compute a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates.

Result: SCS improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks when integrated with RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ methods, with negligible extra computation. It also shows gains on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B models.

Conclusion: SCS provides a simple, general solution to the outcome-reward RL problem in multimodal LLMs, effectively addressing the issue of rewarding unfaithful reasoning trajectories in multiple-choice settings.

Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.

*Peining Zhang,Jinbo Bi,Minghu Song*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: VEDA is a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures, achieving both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy in 3D molecular generation, where flow-based models are fast but inaccurate while diffusion models are accurate but slow.

Method: Combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing using: (1) VE schedule for noise injection analogous to simulated annealing, (2) novel preconditioning scheme reconciling SE(3)-equivariant networks with diffusion objectives, and (3) arcsin-based scheduler concentrating sampling in critical intervals.

Result: Matches flow-based model efficiency with only 100 sampling steps, achieves state-of-the-art valency stability and validity, and generates remarkably stable structures with median relaxation energy of only 1.72 kcal/mol (vs 32.3 kcal/mol baseline).

Conclusion: Principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D molecular generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can enhance the reliability of multi-agent systems, particularly from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance.

Method: Designed CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism that uses probe-based weighted information flow transmission to leverage LLMs' intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities.

Result: CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7% fault rate), surpassing traditional methods with remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism and better Byzantine fault tolerance than traditional agents, and the proposed CP-WBFT mechanism effectively enhances the stability and reliability of multi-agent systems across different network topologies.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

TL;DR: Music Flamingo is a large audio-language model that advances music understanding by addressing challenges in music's complex nature and data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music understanding in AI models has been limited due to music's dynamic, layered nature and scarcity of high-quality annotated data, restricting models to producing only short captions and surface-level answers with poor cross-cultural generalization.

Method: Curated MF-Skills dataset with rich captions and QA pairs; fine-tuned enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone; introduced post-training with MF-Think chain-of-thought dataset and GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model.

Conclusion: Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding, moving from surface-level recognition to layered, human-like perception of songs, providing a foundation for next-generation models that engage with music meaningfully.

Abstract: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

TL;DR: Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP) attack uses retroreflective materials activated only under headlights to create stealthy, effective attacks on traffic sign recognition systems, achieving high success rates in real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on traffic sign recognition systems suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces that need investigation.

Method: Developed retroreflection simulation method and used black-box optimization to create ARP attacks that combine patch deployability with laser stealthiness, activated only under victim headlight illumination.

Result: ARP achieves ≥93.4% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and ≥60% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions, with higher stealthiness than previous patch attacks.

Conclusion: ARP demonstrates significant vulnerability in TSR systems, while the proposed DPR Shield defense using polarized filters achieves ≥75% defense success rates against such attacks.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.

TL;DR: LLM personas simulate human biases to study misinformation spread, showing identity-driven personas accelerate misinformation while expert personas maintain factual stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how misinformation thrives through human cognitive biases, emotional triggers, and identity-driven reasoning on social media platforms.

Method: Model LLM personas as synthetic agents with user-level biases and ideological alignments, using an auditor-node framework to track misinformation evolution through sequential rewrites and measure factual fidelity.

Result: Identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology, while expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion.

Conclusion: LLMs serve dual roles as proxies for human biases and as auditors for tracing information fidelity, providing an interpretable framework for studying and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in real-world medical scenarios due to lack of context-awareness, failing to recognize critical details like user identity, medical history, and risk factors.

Method: Proposes Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR) using attribute-conditioned query generation, LLM self-evaluation across three facets, response refinement, and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly improves LLM performance on HealthBench, with Qwen3-32B achieving new SOTA (63.8% overall, 43.1% on hard subset) through knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: MuSeR effectively enhances LLMs' context-awareness in medical applications, demonstrating strong performance improvements and the ability to surpass teacher models through distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency in complex reasoning tasks, and existing KG-enhanced methods face challenges with inaccurate retrieval, reasoning failures, and poor context construction that obscures relevant information.

Method: Decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, progressively extends partial reasoning paths, uses external retrievers for candidate evidence, applies uncertainty-aware pruning by LLM, and optimizes context organization of reasoning paths.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA on three well-known datasets, demonstrating improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: ProgRAG effectively addresses retrieval and reasoning failures in KG-enhanced LLMs through progressive decomposition and uncertainty-aware evidence refinement, offering a more reliable approach for complex knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional style-based fake news detection is becoming less effective as adversaries mimic authentic writing styles, while current LLM approaches face challenges with shallow exploration, ambiguous usability, and high costs.

Method: FactGuard leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, introduces dynamic usability mechanisms to identify contradictions and ambiguous cases, and employs knowledge distillation to create FactGuard-D for efficient deployment.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FactGuard consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: FactGuard effectively addresses style sensitivity and LLM usability challenges in fake news detection, providing a practical and reliable solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS.

Conclusion: The reasoning-based problem generator with adaptive difficulty calibration and co-evolution framework effectively creates high-quality training data for reasoning models.

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sim-to-real gap in cyber physical systems testing by developing a formal method to validate simulated failure scenarios against real-world sensor data using Scenic scenario programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure that failure scenarios discovered in simulation are reproducible in real-world systems, addressing the sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data.

Method: Introduces a formal definition for matching labeled time series sensor data to abstract scenarios represented as Scenic probabilistic programming language programs, with a querying algorithm to identify matching data subsets.

Result: The algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and scales well with the duration of queried time series data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively validates simulated failure scenarios against real-world data, bridging the sim-to-real gap in CPS testing.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

### [186] [Probability-Biased Attention over Directed Bipartite Graphs for Long-Tail ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09559)
*Tianlei Chen,Yuxiao Chen,Yang Li,Feifei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with co-occurrence encoding to improve automated ICD coding, especially for rare codes in long-tail distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated ICD coding faces challenges due to large label space (10K-20K codes) and long-tail distribution where rare codes lack sufficient training data.

Method: Constructs a Directed Bipartite Graph with common and rare code nodes, using probability-based bias from co-occurrence statistics in attention module. Uses LLM-generated code descriptions for enriched embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three ICD coding benchmarks with notable improvements in Macro-F1, the key metric for long-tail classification.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the long-tail problem in ICD coding by leveraging co-occurrence relationships and external knowledge from LLMs.

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OutSafe-Bench is a comprehensive multimodal content safety evaluation benchmark with 18K+ bilingual prompts, 4.5K images, 450 audio clips, and 450 videos across 9 risk categories, featuring novel metrics for robust safety assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about MLLMs outputting unsafe content (toxic language, biased imagery, privacy violations, misinformation) and limitations of current safety benchmarks in modality coverage and evaluation methods.

Method: Created OutSafe-Bench dataset spanning 4 modalities with systematic annotation across 9 risk categories. Introduced MCRS metric for overlapping risk assessment and FairScore framework using top-performing models as adaptive juries for unbiased evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, highlighting significant safety gaps in current multimodal models.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs, as current models show concerning safety vulnerabilities despite their widespread integration into tools and agents.

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AgentEvolver is a self-evolving agent system that uses LLMs to enable autonomous agent learning through self-questioning, self-navigating, and self-attributing mechanisms, achieving more efficient exploration and faster adaptation than traditional RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to developing autonomous agents using LLMs are costly and inefficient, requiring manual task datasets and RL pipelines with extensive random exploration, leading to high data costs and poor sample utilization.

Method: AgentEvolver introduces three mechanisms: self-questioning for curiosity-driven task generation, self-navigating for improved exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance, and self-attributing for enhanced sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards.

Result: Preliminary experiments show AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Conclusion: AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities by integrating self-evolving mechanisms into a unified framework.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

*Rishi Singhal,Jung-Eun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LayerNorm's role differs in Pre- vs Post-LayerNorm transformers: critical for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm but affects memorization in Post-LayerNorm models, with early layers being most influential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning differently in Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformer architectures, as its impact remains unclear despite being a fundamental component.

Method: Analyzed the effects of removing LayerNorm parameters across 13 models on 6 Vision and Language datasets, examining how it impacts memorization and learning stability in both Pre- and Post-LayerNorm architectures.

Result: Removing LayerNorm in Pre-LayerNorm models increases memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models it reduces memorization by restoring genuine labels. Early layers' LayerNorm is most critical across both architectures.

Conclusion: LayerNorm plays distinct roles in Pre- vs Post-LayerNorm transformers - essential for stable learning in the former and controlling memorization in the latter, with early layers being particularly influential.

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

TL;DR: Proposes a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional context and ethical constraints into personalized decision systems, addressing limitations of static rule-based approaches in healthcare and behavioral support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized decision systems in healthcare overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints, risking insensitive or unsafe interventions in domains like mental illness, substance use disorders, and depression.

Method: Formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with multi-objective reward function balancing short-term engagement and long-term well-being, using emotion-informed state representation and safety-constrained RL algorithms.

Result: Conceptual framework that operationalizes empathy and responsibility in machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI for emotionally aware personalization systems.

Conclusion: Initiates methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for trustworthy personalization systems in human-centric domains like behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics.

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a dataset distillation framework that uses multiple teacher models with different architectures to generate more diverse synthetic data, addressing the bias problem in single-teacher methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods inherit inductive bias from single teacher models, leading to overly smooth and homogeneous synthetic samples with reduced intra-class diversity and limited generalization.

Method: PRISM decouples logit-matching and regularization objectives, using different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization alignment. It also introduces scalable cross-class batch formation for fast parallel synthesis.

Result: PRISM consistently outperforms single-teacher methods (SRe2L) and multi-teacher variants (G-VBSM) on ImageNet-1K at low- and mid-IPC regimes, with significantly richer intra-class diversity reflected by notable drop in cosine similarity between features.

Conclusion: Using diverse architectural priors through multiple teacher models improves dataset distillation by generating more diverse synthetic data with better generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack that modifies post-hoc XAI explanations without changing model predictions, requiring only access to predictions and explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in current explainability methods by showing how explanations can be manipulated while maintaining the same predicted class and being visually undetectable.

Method: Single-step adversarial attack that modifies original images to change explanations from methods like saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP, without requiring model weights or architecture access.

Result: Successfully generated attacks that dramatically change explanations without altering predictive probabilities, validated using mean absolute difference for explanation changes and SSIM for image similarity.

Conclusion: The low requirements of this attack reveal critical vulnerabilities in current XAI methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

TL;DR: Matryoshka Transcoders is a framework that automatically discovers and interprets physical plausibility failures in generative models using hierarchical sparse feature learning and large multimodal models for interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models often produce physically implausible outputs that escape detection by existing evaluation methods, and there's no framework for automatically identifying specific physical error patterns to enable targeted improvements.

Method: Extends Matryoshka representation learning to transcoder architectures for hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels, training on intermediate representations from physical plausibility classifiers and using large multimodal models for interpretation.

Result: Achieves superior feature relevance and accuracy compared to existing approaches, identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, and establishes a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into how state-of-the-art generative models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for targeted model improvements in physical plausibility.

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as a model-free measure of class imbalance that outperforms traditional cardinality-based methods and can be combined with cardinality for further improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cardinality-based imbalance measures ignore redundant examples and class learning difficulties, while complex measures like training loss require model training. There's a need for an easy-to-compute, model-free imbalance measure.

Method: Using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an imbalance measure that can be incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods, and testing its combination with cardinality-based approaches.

Result: Across five datasets with diverse imbalance ratios, ID consistently outperformed cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques. Combining ID with cardinality further improved performance.

Conclusion: Intrinsic Dimensionality is an effective, model-free measure for class imbalance that can enhance existing imbalance mitigation methods and works well when combined with traditional cardinality measures.

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.
