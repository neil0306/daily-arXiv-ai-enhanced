Although previous research has conducted extensive\nstudies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's\nunique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as\nyouth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the\nfeatures of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing\ntoxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For\nthese questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the\nfirst Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive\nanalysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated\nwith several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and\ntext-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current\ntoxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we\npropose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity\ndetection.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores youth-toxicity in social media, focusing on language perceived as toxic by youth but not adults.

However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions.
