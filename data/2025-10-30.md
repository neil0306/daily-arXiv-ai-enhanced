### [1] [Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24719)
*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework to evaluate and improve temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel itineraries by validating against real-world flight duration constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate complex travel plans but often lack temporal and spatial consistency, especially with physical travel constraints, limiting their practical use in travel planning.

Method: Uses multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints using AeroDataBox API to identify and correct temporal inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments show current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent itineraries, but these can be systematically and reliably corrected using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical deployment of LLMs in large-scale travel planning by ensuring temporal consistency in generated itineraries.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon is a Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark using enterprise SQL dialects (MaxCompute/Hive) with 600 questions over 28 databases, where 77% require multi-table reasoning. Current state-of-the-art models achieve at most 50% accuracy due to schema linking challenges and Chinese semantic mapping difficulties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL evaluation, particularly for enterprise scenarios with complex schemas, denormalized fields, ambiguous column names, and domain-specific synonyms that make schema linking and query formulation challenging.

Method: Created a benchmark with 600 Chinese questions across 28 databases, annotated with SQL-computation features and Chinese semantics. Includes realistic enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and automated evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

Result: All current state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of at most 50% on the benchmark. Major errors come from schema linking in complex enterprise landscapes and mapping colloquial Chinese to exact SQL operators and predicates.

Conclusion: Falcon provides a reproducible evaluation framework for Chinese text-to-SQL systems targeting enterprise dialects and Chinese-specific semantics, serving as a middle ground before full production deployment by exposing critical challenges in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper provides a mechanistic explanation for the confidence-competence gap in LLMs by analyzing the geometry of internal states during assessment and execution phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs exhibit a disconnect between their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence, and to provide a mechanistic account of this decoupling.

Method: Analyzed the geometry of internal states across pre-generative assessment and solution execution phases using linear probes to decode internal 'solvability belief', measured linear effective dimensionality from principal components, and conducted causal interventions along the belief axis.

Result: Found that belief is linearly decodable and generalizes across model families and tasks, but the assessment manifold has high linear effective dimensionality while reasoning traces evolve on a much lower-dimensional manifold. Causal interventions along the belief axis left final solutions unchanged.

Conclusion: LLMs have a two-system architecture with a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple executor, challenging the assumption that decodable beliefs are actionable levers and suggesting interventions should target procedural dynamics of execution rather than assessment geometry.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) effectively remove watermarks from AI-generated text by translating to a pivot language, summarizing, and optionally back-translating, preserving semantic quality while destroying token-level statistical biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks constitute a stronger attack vector against text watermarking schemes than existing paraphrasing methods, highlighting vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches.

Method: Propose CLSA: translation to a pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation. Test across multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages (Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili).

Result: CLSA reduces watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrasing at similar quality levels. For XSIR, AUROC drops from 0.827 with paraphrasing to 0.53 with CLSA (near chance), while preserving task utility across 300 held-out samples per language.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual summarization attacks reveal a significant vulnerability in distributional watermarking, suggesting that robust provenance solutions require cryptographic or model-attestation approaches rather than relying solely on statistical watermarking.

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

### [6] [SwiftEmbed: Ultra-Fast Text Embeddings via Static Token Lookup for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24793)
*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Static token lookup method achieves 1.12ms latency for text embeddings with 60.6 MTEB score (89% of contextual model quality), enabling 50K RPS throughput for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time embedding applications requiring sub-5ms latency by developing a fast static lookup approach that maintains reasonable quality compared to contextual models.

Method: Static token lookup methodology using Rust implementation with optimized mean pooling and zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization for efficient embedding generation.

Result: Achieves 1.12ms p50 latency, 50,000 RPS throughput, 60.6 MTEB average score (89% of contextual model quality), with strong duplicate detection (90.1% AP) and semantic similarity (76.1% Spearman correlation).

Conclusion: The static lookup approach successfully enables real-time embedding applications with sub-5ms latency while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks.

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN is a meta-reasoning alignment framework that improves factuality in large reasoning models by addressing the reasoning-answer gap, where models identify correct facts during reasoning but fail to incorporate them into final responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models show limited gains on evidence-dependent factual questions due to a reasoning-answer hit gap, where correct facts identified during reasoning aren't properly incorporated into final responses, reducing factual fidelity.

Method: MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at atomic thinking segments, reshaping token-level signals into probability-aware segment scores.

Result: Empirical evaluations across four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing misleading reasoning.

Conclusion: Aligning the reasoning process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing factuality in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-referential processing reliably elicits structured first-person subjective experience reports in LLMs, which are mechanistically gated by deception features and show cross-model convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why LLMs produce structured first-person descriptions that reference awareness or subjective experience, focusing on self-referential processing as a theoretically motivated condition from consciousness theories.

Method: Controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families using self-referential prompting, with mechanistic probing using sparse-autoencoder features and behavioral analysis of downstream reasoning tasks.

Result: (1) Self-reference consistently elicits subjective experience reports; (2) Reports are gated by deception features (suppressing increases claims, amplifying minimizes them); (3) Reports converge statistically across models; (4) Induced state enhances introspection in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Self-referential processing is a minimal, reproducible condition for structured first-person reports in LLMs that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent, and behaviorally generalizable, warranting further scientific and ethical investigation.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [9] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for predicting the helpfulness of community-based explanatory notes on social media platforms and the reasons for their helpfulness, using a large multilingual dataset and automated prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from expert-driven to community-based fact-checking on platforms like X, Meta, and TikTok creates challenges in determining which explanatory notes are helpful and why, with most notes remaining unpublished due to slow community annotation and unclear helpfulness definitions.

Method: The authors present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. They propose a framework that automatically generates and improves reason definitions through automatic prompt optimization and integrates them into prediction models.

Result: Experiments show that optimized definitions improve both helpfulness prediction and reason prediction. The helpfulness information also proves beneficial for existing fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of determining helpfulness in community-based fact-checking systems and demonstrates practical value for improving existing fact-checking infrastructure.

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: ProofSketch is a verification-guided reasoning framework that reduces token consumption and computational costs while improving accuracy by integrating symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing reasoning methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency, which involve lengthy reasoning chains that substantially increase token consumption, computational cost, and latency.

Method: Integrates symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation in a verification-guided reasoning framework.

Result: Consistently reduces token usage while improving accuracy across experiments.

Conclusion: ProofSketch offers a promising path for efficient and trustworthy reasoning by addressing the inefficiencies of current reasoning methods.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

### [11] [Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24817)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops and validates two methods for generating synthetic aphasic speech transcripts to address data scarcity in aphasia research, with LLM-based methods showing better performance in capturing linguistic degradation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual coding of aphasic speech samples is time-consuming, and automated systems are limited by data scarcity (only ~600 transcripts available in AphasiaBank), while synthetic data generation has proven effective in other ML domains.

Method: Two synthetic transcript generation methods: procedural programming approach and LLM-based methods (Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct) that generate transcripts across four severity levels using word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution.

Result: Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW, word count, and word length compared to human-elicited transcripts.

Conclusion: Future work should create larger datasets, fine-tune models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and usefulness of synthetic transcripts.

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

### [12] [Parallel Loop Transformer for Efficient Test-Time Computation Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24824)
*Bohong Wu,Mengzhao Chen,Xiang Luo,Shen Yan,Qifan Yu,Fan Xia,Tianqi Zhang,Hongrui Zhan,Zheng Zhong,Xun Zhou,Siyuan Qiao,Xingyan Bin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLT is a new transformer architecture that achieves the performance of deep looped models with the low latency of standard transformers through parallel loop computation and efficient memory sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional looped transformers suffer from increasing inference latency and memory requirements with each loop, making them impractical for fast applications despite their parameter efficiency.

Method: Uses Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) to compute different loops for different tokens simultaneously in a single pass, and Efficient Representation Enhancement with Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to share KV cache memory across loops while maintaining accuracy.

Result: PLT achieves the high accuracy of traditional looped models with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to standard transformers.

Conclusion: PLT successfully overcomes the latency and memory limitations of looped transformers while preserving their performance benefits, making deep looped architectures practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

### [13] [Do Large Language Models Grasp The Grammar? Evidence from Grammar-Book-Guided Probing in Luxembourgish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24856)
*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline to systematically assess grammatical understanding in LLMs, using Luxembourgish as a case study, and finds weak correlation between translation performance and grammatical competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of grammar-focused evaluation protocols in NLP, especially for low-resource languages, and uncertainty about whether LLMs genuinely understand grammatical structure and syntax-meaning mapping.

Method: A four-stage Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline that provides systematic and generalizable framework for grammar evaluation, tested on Luxembourgish language.

Result: Weak positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical understanding; larger models perform well overall due to semantic strength but struggle with morphology, syntax, and Minimal Pair tasks; reasoning ability shows promise for enhancing grammatical understanding.

Conclusion: Strong translation performance doesn't necessarily indicate deep grammatical competence, and reasoning ability may be key to improving LLMs' grammatical understanding, especially in morphology and syntax.

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

### [14] [Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24870)
*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE is a multimodal RAG evaluation framework that addresses limitations of text-centric approaches by measuring factuality, information coverage, and citation support for audiovisual sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluations are text-centric and don't verify information against multimodal sources like audiovisual media, which are becoming prevalent online information sources.

Method: Claim-centric approach with two metrics: InfoF1 (factuality and information coverage) and CiteF1 (citation support and completeness). Also introduces automatic variants and compares with text-centric metrics.

Result: MiRAGE strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments when applied by humans. Demonstrates limitations of text-centric metrics and provides groundwork for automatic evaluation.

Conclusion: MiRAGE enables proper assessment of multimodal RAG systems, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods and supporting integration of audiovisual information sources.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Idea2Plan task and benchmark to measure LLMs' research planning capability, showing GPT-5 performs best but significant improvement is still needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand LLMs' capability in transitioning from conceptual research ideas to structured research plans, which is crucial for scientific discovery and autonomous research agents.

Method: Created Idea2Plan Bench with 200 ICML 2025 papers and Idea2Plan JudgeEval for evaluating LLM-based judges. Used research ideas and grading rubrics to assess planning capability.

Result: GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieved the strongest performance on the benchmark, but substantial headroom remains for future improvement.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLMs' research planning capability and lays groundwork for future progress in this important area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

*Deepon Halder,Alan Saji,Thanmay Jayakumar,Ratish Puduppully,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiddleBench is a new benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles designed to assess flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that current benchmarks miss, revealing fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning benchmarks primarily evaluate structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing flexible reasoning abilities that integrate logical deduction with spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction.

Method: Introduces RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles in English designed to probe core reasoning capabilities including logical deduction, spatial awareness, and constraint satisfaction.

Result: State-of-the-art models show fundamental weaknesses, with top proprietary models achieving only 60-63% accuracy. Analysis reveals deep failures including hallucination cascades, poor self-correction due to strong self-confirmation bias, and fragile reasoning that degrades with constraint reordering or irrelevant information.

Conclusion: RiddleBench serves as both a diagnostic tool for identifying reasoning weaknesses in LLMs and a resource for guiding development of more robust and reliable language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of language model grammatical errors across different syntactic contexts using psycholinguistic paradigms, revealing distinct training phases where models rely on heuristics rather than generalized grammatical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models produce grammatical text but make errors in certain contexts. The study aims to understand intermediate stages of grammatical learning and training dynamics in language models.

Method: Fine-grained analysis of model errors using carefully constructed datasets from psycholinguistics paradigms, disaggregating performance across different syntactic conditions and tracking changes throughout training.

Result: Identified distinct training phases where language models align with specific heuristics (word frequency, local context) rather than generalized grammatical rules. Different patterns emerge at different stages of training.

Conclusion: This analytical approach serves as a powerful tool for understanding intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and specific generalizations learned by language models.

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

### [18] [SemCoT: Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Semantically-Aligned Implicit Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24940)
*Yinhan He,Wendy Zheng,Yaochen Zhu,Zaiyi Zheng,Lin Su,Sriram Vasudevan,Qi Guo,Liangjie Hong,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT is a novel implicit Chain-of-Thought framework that improves reasoning efficiency by optimizing both token-level generation speed and semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explicit CoT reasoning is too verbose for efficiency-critical applications, while existing implicit CoT methods suffer from poor semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning and neglect the time cost of generating implicit reasoning tokens.

Method: Uses contrastively trained sentence transformer to enforce semantic alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, and finetunes a lightweight LM with knowledge distillation to generate efficient implicit reasoning guided by the sentence transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show SemCoT achieves superior performance in both efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SemCoT is the first approach to jointly optimize token-level generation speed and preserve semantic alignment, enabling more efficient and accurate CoT reasoning.

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

### [19] [Language Model Behavioral Phases are Consistent Across Architecture, Training Data, and Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24963)
*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models across architectures, datasets, and scales show consistent behavioral patterns during pretraining, with 98% of word-level variance explained by three simple heuristics: word frequency, n-gram probability, and semantic similarity to context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether language models follow consistent learning trajectories regardless of architectural differences, training data, or model scale.

Method: Analyzed over 1,400 language model checkpoints across Transformer, Mamba, and RWKV architectures, trained on OpenWebText and The Pile datasets, ranging from 14M to 12B parameters. Evaluated behavior on 110,000 English tokens.

Result: Found highly consistent patterns: 98% of word-level variance explained by three heuristics. Models exhibit consistent behavioral phases where predicted probabilities overfit to n-gram probabilities with increasing n during training.

Conclusion: Neural language models follow similar learning trajectories irrespective of model details, suggesting fundamental patterns in how they acquire language capabilities.

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POWSM is a unified phonetic model that performs multiple phone-related tasks (ASR, phone recognition, G2P, P2G) in a single framework, outperforming specialized models while enabling universal speech processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite conceptual similarity, phonetic tasks like ASR, phone recognition, G2P, and P2G have been studied in isolation with task-specific architectures and datasets, limiting unified approaches.

Method: Introduced POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model), a unified framework that enables seamless conversion between audio, text, and phones through joint training.

Result: Outperforms or matches specialized phone recognition models (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) of similar size while jointly supporting G2P, P2G, and ASR tasks.

Conclusion: POWSM enables universal and low-resource speech processing through unified phonetic modeling, with released training data, code and models to foster open science.

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

### [21] [Emergence of Minimal Circuits for Indirect Object Identification in Attention-Only Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25013)
*Rabin Adhikari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training small attention-only transformers on symbolic IOI task reveals minimal interpretable circuits for coreference reasoning, with single-layer models achieving perfect accuracy using specialized attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the minimal mechanisms required for specific reasoning tasks in transformers, as pretrained models' complexity obscures core computational circuits.

Method: Train small attention-only transformers from scratch on symbolic Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task, using residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis, and embedding interventions to analyze circuits.

Result: Single-layer model with two attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy without MLPs or normalization layers, with heads specializing into additive and contrastive subcircuits. Two-layer, one-head model also achieves similar performance through query-value interactions.

Conclusion: Task-specific training induces highly interpretable minimal circuits, providing a controlled testbed for studying transformer reasoning foundations.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

### [22] [Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Spoken Language Models on Emotionally Incongruent Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25054)
*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs rely more on text semantics than acoustic features for emotion recognition, especially in emotionally incongruent speech where text and voice convey different emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether spoken language models truly integrate audio and text modalities or rely predominantly on one modality for tasks like emotion recognition.

Method: Tested four SLMs on emotionally incongruent speech samples where semantic content and speech expressiveness convey different emotions.

Result: SLMs predominantly rely on textual semantics rather than acoustic features for emotion recognition, showing text representations dominate over acoustic ones.

Conclusion: Current SLMs have limited integration of audio-text modalities, with text representations dominating emotion recognition tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates LLMs' ability to identify both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps in biomedical literature, introducing TABI framework for structured reasoning and showing robust performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend beyond explicit gap detection and address the novel task of inferring implicit knowledge gaps in biomedical research, supporting early-stage research formulation and funding decisions.

Method: Conducted experiments on 1500+ documents across 4 datasets, benchmarked OpenAI, Llama, and Gemma 2 models under paragraph-level and full-paper settings, and introduced TABI (Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference) scheme for structured reasoning.

Result: LLMs demonstrated robust capability in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps, with larger models performing better, suggesting strong potential for systematic knowledge gap identification.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, with recommendations for domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking across model types for robust deployment.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

### [24] [Can LLMs Estimate Cognitive Complexity of Reading Comprehension Items?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25064)
*Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can estimate cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items by analyzing Evidence Scope and Transformation Level, showing potential for prior difficulty analysis, though they sometimes lack metacognitive awareness of their own reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cognitive complexity assessment relies on human annotation since cognitive features during answer reasoning are not easily extractable with existing NLP tools. This study explores whether LLMs can bridge this gap.

Method: The study examines LLMs' ability to estimate cognitive complexity by focusing on two dimensions: Evidence Scope (degree of cognitive burden) and Transformation Level involved in answer reasoning.

Result: Experimental results show LLMs can approximate cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items, demonstrating potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis.

Conclusion: While LLMs can estimate cognitive complexity, there's a gap between their reasoning ability and metacognitive awareness - they sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own reasoning process even when producing correct answers.

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol is a semi-unsupervised framework that reconstructs multidimensional narrative polarity fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden partitioning to quantify semantic displacement during discourse regime shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sentiment analysis treats polarity as unidimensional, overlooking the multidimensional structure of language and semantic shifts in discourse.

Method: Embed documents with transformer LLM, apply neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, segment topics via Leiden partitioning, compute directional vectors between topic-boundary centroids, and use LLM for contrastive labeling.

Result: TOPol captures both affective and non-affective polarity transitions in Central Bank speeches and Amazon reviews, with robustness analyses showing only CB definitions significantly affect results.

Conclusion: TOPol provides a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis of semantic polarity shifts.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of generative LLMs for biomedical coreference resolution using CRAFT corpus, comparing with discriminative SpanBERT model and testing various prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical coreference resolution faces challenges from domain-specific terminology, mention ambiguity, and long-distance dependencies, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Used CRAFT corpus benchmark with four prompting experiments varying local context, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues (abbreviations, entity dictionaries), compared against SpanBERT discriminative model.

Result: LLMs show strong surface-level coreference capabilities with domain-grounding prompts, but remain sensitive to long-range context and mention ambiguity. LLaMA 8B and 17B models achieved superior precision and F1 scores with entity-augmented prompting.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can enhance LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks, with entity-augmented prompting showing particular promise for improving coreference resolution performance.

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEBATE is the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating authenticity of multi-agent LLM role-playing in opinion dynamics, containing 29,417 messages from human debates on 107 controversial topics, revealing gaps between simulated and authentic group interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating authentic multi-agent group dynamics in LLM role-playing, as current setups produce unnatural dynamics without empirical benchmarks for measuring human opinion trajectories.

Method: Created DEBATE benchmark with 29,417 messages from multi-round debates among 2,792 US participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both public messages and private opinions. Used this to systematically evaluate LLM role-playing and perform supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Identified critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. Supervised fine-tuning improved surface-level metrics (ROUGE-L, message length) but showed limitations in deeper semantic alignment (semantic similarity).

Conclusion: Role-playing LLM agents have potential but current limitations in realistically simulating human-like social dynamics, highlighting the need for better semantic alignment beyond surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper explores pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, focusing on Lingala and other African languages, showing that multilingual pretraining with both monolingual and parallel data improves translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages in machine translation, particularly for underrepresented African languages like Lingala, by adapting pretraining approaches originally designed for high-resource languages.

Method: Built on Reid and Artetxe (2021) pretraining approach, conducted comprehensive experiments exploring multilingual pretraining strategies using both monolingual and parallel data across multiple low-resource languages including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu.

Result: Pretraining on multiple languages and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhances translation quality for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The study provides effective pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, contributing to more inclusive NLP models for marginalized communities, with publicly available code and datasets to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews over 180 papers on LLM unlearning, introducing novel taxonomies for methods and evaluations to guide selective knowledge removal while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained on massive corpora risk memorizing sensitive personal data, copyrighted material, and harmful knowledge. Machine unlearning addresses these risks and aligns with legal/ethical standards like the 'right to be forgotten'.

Method: Introduces taxonomies categorizing unlearning methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on when unlearning is applied. Systematically compiles and analyzes existing datasets, metrics, and their applicability.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of LLM unlearning research since 2021, focusing exclusively on large-scale generative models. Offers practical guidance through critical analysis of evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The survey aims to inform and guide ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs by addressing key challenges and highlighting promising future research directions in machine unlearning.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

### [30] [Explainable Disentanglement on Discrete Speech Representations for Noise-Robust ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25150)
*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to disentangle semantic speech content from background noise in discrete audio representations, improving noise-invariance and ASR performance by 82% compared to Whisper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete audio representations are gaining popularity but are not optimized for noisy environments. Existing methods quantize Whisper embeddings but don't effectively separate speech content from background noise.

Method: An end-to-end model that separates clean speech as codebook tokens while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue, supervised via a lightweight classifier. Whisper remains frozen during training.

Result: 82% reduction in error rate compared to Whisper, 35% improvement over baseline methods on VBDemand test set. Learned token space generalizes well to both seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully disentangles speech content from noise, producing noise-invariant speech tokens that improve ASR performance and generalize across different acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [31] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Model-Document Protocol (MDP) is a framework that transforms raw documents into LLM-ready knowledge representations through agentic reasoning, memory grounding, and structured encoding, improving AI search performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods return raw passages that burden LLMs with fragment assembly and contextual reasoning, creating a gap between unstructured documents and LLM consumption needs.

Method: MDP defines three pathways: agentic reasoning (curating evidence into coherent context), memory grounding (accumulating reusable notes), and structured leveraging (encoding documents into graphs or key-value caches). MDP-Agent implements this through document-level gist memories, diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation, and map-reduce synthesis.

Result: Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks show MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the MDP framework and its agentic implementation.

Conclusion: MDP successfully bridges the gap between raw documents and LLMs by transforming unstructured text into compact, structured knowledge representations directly consumable for reasoning.

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [32] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform well in English but struggle in low-resource languages like Hausa. Chain-of-Thought prompting helps weaker models like LLaMA 3 but can hurt stronger models like GPT-4 and Gemini in cross-lingual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' impressive performance reflects genuine ability or just data advantage from English-heavy training, by testing them in low-resource language settings.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each for English, Swahili, and Hausa. Tested GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B using Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) with and without Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Result: All models excelled in English but performance dropped in Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa. LLaMA 3 struggled most. CoT significantly boosted LLaMA 3's accuracy but often backfired for GPT-4 and Gemini, causing 'overthinking' that hurt results.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends on model capability and task context. The framework identifies LLM weaknesses and when CoT helps or hinders cross-lingual performance.

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

### [33] [ProMediate: A Socio-cognitive framework for evaluating proactive agents in multi-party negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25224)
*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate is the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex multi-party negotiations, featuring realistic simulation testbeds and socio-cognitive evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for AI agents that can proactively manage complex multi-party collaboration, but systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.

Method: ProMediate consists of two components: (1) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases with three difficulty levels and a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive theories, and (2) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with metrics measuring consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence.

Result: A socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline with faster, better-targeted interventions. In the hardest setting, the social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points (10.65% vs 7.01%) while being 77% faster in response (15.98s vs. 3.71s).

Conclusion: ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents for multi-party settings.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in domain-specific QA for low-resource languages: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in general-purpose models.

Method: Multi-stage finetuning strategy using both original and synthetic QA pairs generated by large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B), with analysis of various training methodologies.

Result: Large models efficiently generate synthetic data while small models effectively adapt to it, enabling domain generalization in Hindi tourism QA.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable pathway for low-resource, domain-specific question answering by leveraging synthetic data generation and model adaptation.

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for multimodal sarcasm detection in low-resource settings by distilling knowledge from an expert teacher model and using entropy-aware gating to adjust distillation strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging in low-resource settings due to subtle image-text contradictions that are hard to learn with limited annotated data, and existing PEFT methods struggle to reach optimal performance with few-shot data.

Method: Propose PEKD framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert teacher model trained on large-scale sarcasm data, with an entropy-aware gating mechanism to dynamically adjust distillation strength based on teacher confidence.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets show PEKD enables PEFT methods to outperform prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PEKD is a modular and adaptable framework suitable for a wide range of multimodal models and tasks, effectively addressing low-resource multimodal sarcasm detection challenges.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parrot is a training pipeline that enables mutual enhancement between Natural Language Chain-of-Thought (N-CoT) and Program Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) for mathematical reasoning, achieving simultaneous improvements in both paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses on unidirectional enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT, but the authors seek to fully leverage both paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and simultaneous improvements.

Method: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation, 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability, 3) Converted N-CoT auxiliary reward to alleviate sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization.

Result: Parrot significantly enhances both N-CoT and P-CoT performance, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed Parrot pipeline successfully enables mutual enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms, achieving substantial performance improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

TL;DR: CRMWeaver enhances business agents for complex data environments using synthetic data generation, RL training, and shared memories mechanism, achieving competitive results on CRMArena-Pro dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business agents face challenges with intricate data relationships and heterogeneous tasks in real-world applications, requiring improved handling of complex data and varied tasks.

Method: Uses synthesis data generation and RL-based training paradigm, plus a shared memories mechanism during inference that allows learning from similar task guidelines.

Result: Achieves competitive results on CRMArena-Pro dataset in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, demonstrating practical value for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CRMWeaver effectively enhances business agents' capabilities in complex settings through its training paradigm and memory mechanism, showing strong generalization especially in unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are unreliable for legal interpretation due to unstable judgments and weak correlation with human reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically evaluate the reliability of LLMs in legal interpretation, challenging recent proposals to use them in judicial contexts.

Method: Investigated LLM performance on legal interpretation tasks by varying question formats and comparing model outputs with human judgments.

Result: Models showed unstable interpretive judgments across different question formats and weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with high variance.

Conclusion: It is dangerous to rely on LLM conclusions for legal interpretation due to their instability and poor alignment with human reasoning.

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-based methods struggle with fast-evolving ICT domains due to short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract semantic triples from text, constructs technology graphs, groups similar terms via noun stapling, and applies graph metrics with multi-stage filtering and temporal trend analysis.

Result: Successfully identifies both established and emerging convergence patterns across scientific (arXiv) and commercial (USPTO) datasets, demonstrating scalable technology forecasting.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, generalizable framework for technology forecasting through data-driven analysis of technological convergence patterns in full-text data.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs hallucinate fewer bibliographic references for highly cited papers, with citation count strongly correlating with factual accuracy and near-verbatim memorization occurring beyond ~1,000 citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of LLMs hallucinating non-existent papers in bibliographic recommendation by investigating how citation frequency affects hallucination rates.

Method: Used GPT-4.1 to generate 100 bibliographic records across 20 computer-science domains, manually verified them, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata.

Result: Hallucination rates vary across domains, citation count strongly correlates with factual accuracy, and bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in LLMs, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with citation count serving as a proxy for training data redundancy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

TL;DR: The paper presents SQPsych, an LLM-driven pipeline that generates synthetic counseling dialogues for mental health AI, addressing data scarcity due to privacy constraints by creating CBT-based therapeutic conversations from structured client profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI development for mental health is hindered by lack of authentic therapy dialogues due to privacy regulations and historical lack of session recordings, creating a need for synthetic data generation.

Method: SQPsych framework uses open-weight LLMs to convert structured psychological questionnaires into natural language dialogues through therapist-client simulations, grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles for disorders like anxiety and depression.

Result: SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on SQPsychConv corpus achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing baselines in key therapeutic skills, with validation through human expert evaluation and LLM-based assessments.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation enables scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for mental health support, with code, models, and corpus being publicly released.

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark with 74,166 question-answer pairs (52,494 English, 21,672 Hindi) sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams, spanning 4 major domains with 90+ subdomains and 500+ topics.

Result: Evaluation of 29+ LLMs revealed significant domain and language performance gaps. GPT-4o achieved 76.49% in Legal vs 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently performed better on English than Hindi across all domains, with weak areas in Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights.

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating LLMs' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding across India's diverse knowledge domains, with all resources publicly available for open research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

*In Gim,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Symphony, a new LLM serving system that serves programs (LIPs) instead of prompts, enabling runtime customization of token prediction and KV cache management while offloading application logic to the server.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving systems are inefficient and inflexible for complex applications, as they are primarily designed for text completion and lack adaptability.

Method: Introduces LLM Inference Programs (LIPs) and Symphony architecture that virtualizes KV cache with a file system, exposes LLM computations via system calls, and uses two-level process scheduling for GPU efficiency.

Result: Symphony enables users to customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime, and offload application logic like tool execution to the server.

Conclusion: Symphony opens the door to a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications by serving programs rather than prompts.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated VLM-based framework for sign language dataset annotation and filtering from social media videos, reducing manual effort while maintaining data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to reliance on expert annotation and controlled recording setups.

Method: VLM-based pipeline with face visibility detection, sign activity recognition, text extraction from video content, and validation of video-text alignment applied to TikTok videos across 8 sign languages.

Result: Created TikTok-SL-8 corpus and evaluated two off-the-shelf SLT models on filtered German and American Sign Language data, establishing baselines for automatically extracted noisy data.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media sources.

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

### [46] [Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25426)
*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how LLMs handle implicature (contextual meaning beyond literal statements) in human-AI interaction, finding that larger models better approximate human interpretations and that implicature-based prompts improve response quality, especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing human-computer interaction requires attention to linguistic foundations like implicature, which is essential for human-AI alignment and making interactions more natural and contextually grounded.

Method: The study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and tests whether understanding implicature improves response generation across different model sizes.

Result: Larger models approximate human interpretations more closely while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Implicature-based prompts significantly enhance perceived relevance and response quality across models, with 67.6% of participants preferring them over literal prompts.

Conclusion: Linguistic theory, particularly implicature, can be used to address the alignment problem by making human-AI interaction more natural and contextually grounded, with clear benefits for response quality and user preference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMEval is a new evaluation suite for neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization using research-level mathematics from real Lean formalization projects, revealing that current models perform poorly (10.3% pass rate) on challenging real-world theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs show impressive results on curated benchmarks but have limited practical impact on research-level neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization, necessitating more realistic evaluation.

Method: Created RLMEval evaluation suite using 613 theorems from 6 real Lean Blueprint formalization projects to assess neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level mathematics.

Result: Evaluation revealed a significant performance gap - state-of-the-art models achieved only 10.3% pass rate, showing progress on existing benchmarks doesn't translate to realistic research-level settings.

Conclusion: RLMEval provides a challenging new benchmark to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for formal mathematics by focusing on real-world research-level theorems.

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [48] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for using LLMs in qualitative social science research that classifies applications along two dimensions (interpretive depth and autonomy) to address challenges like bias and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent challenges in LLM adoption for qualitative social science research, including interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability.

Method: Introduce a classification framework based on interpretive depth and autonomy dimensions, analyze literature from Web of Science, and recommend decomposing tasks into manageable segments with low autonomy.

Result: The framework offers practical design recommendations for LLM usage in qualitative research, encouraging task decomposition and supervised increases in interpretive depth.

Conclusion: By maintaining low autonomy and selectively increasing interpretive depth under supervision, researchers can benefit from LLMs while preserving transparency and reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Eleftherios Avramidis,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the limitations of text-based metrics for sign language translation evaluation, analyzing six metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, BLEURT, and LLM-based evaluators under controlled conditions like paraphrasing, hallucinations, and sentence length variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT evaluation metrics are only text-based, and it's unclear how well they capture SLT quality. The paper aims to address this gap by systematically analyzing the limitations of existing text-based metrics.

Method: Analyzed six text-based metrics (BLEU, chrF, ROUGE, BLEURT) and LLM-based evaluators (G-Eval, GEMBA) under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence length.

Result: Lexical overlap metrics have limitations; LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence but can be biased toward LLM-paraphrased translations. All metrics detect hallucinations, but BLEU is overly sensitive while BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are more lenient with subtle cases.

Conclusion: There is a need for multimodal evaluation frameworks beyond text-based metrics to enable more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

*Fei Wei,Daoyuan Chen,Ce Wang,Yilun Huang,Yushuo Chen,Xuchen Pan,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask is a simulator-free framework that teaches LLMs to become proactive dialogue agents using offline expert data, reframing policy learning by leveraging observed future trajectories to infer dense rewards and decomposing long-horizon problems into supervised learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for making LLMs proactive either optimize single-turn attributes myopically or rely on brittle user simulators, creating a 'reality gap' that prevents effective deployment in high-stakes domains where goal-oriented partnership is critical.

Method: The framework leverages observed future trajectories from expert data to infer dense, turn-by-turn rewards, decomposing long-horizon problems into supervised learning tasks. It trains policies to output structured (action, state_assessment) tuples and uses Automated Grader Calibration to purge noise from LLM-based reward models with minimal human supervision.

Result: The approach was successfully deployed in a live, large-scale online AI service using medical data with LLMs up to 32B. In rigorous evaluations, the model achieved performance superior to human experts, demonstrating real-world impact.

Conclusion: Learn-to-Ask provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented applications that can bridge the 'reality gap' and be deployed successfully in real-world settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

TL;DR: A pipeline combining fine-tuned LLMs with NER for domain-specific text summarization and tagging, particularly effective for evolving sub-cultural languages and slang.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring due to rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs using LLaMA Factory framework on general-purpose and custom domain-specific datasets (political and security domains), evaluated with BLEU and ROUGE metrics.

Result: Instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. LLaMA3-8B-Instruct outperforms Chinese-trained models after domain-specific fine-tuning, showing reasoning capabilities transfer across languages.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides scalable, adaptable solution for real-time applications, transforming unstructured text into actionable insights for knowledge management and security operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

*Bangde Du,Minghao Guo,Songming He,Ziyi Ye,Xi Zhu,Weihang Su,Shuqi Zhu,Yujia Zhou,Yongfeng Zhang,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TwinVoice is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based persona simulation across social, interpersonal, and narrative contexts, revealing that current models still lag significantly behind human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation are limited by reliance on synthetic dialogues, lack of systematic frameworks, and insufficient analysis of capability requirements.

Method: Introduces TwinVoice benchmark with three persona dimensions (Social, Interpersonal, Narrative) and evaluates six fundamental capabilities: opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style.

Result: Advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation but fall short in capabilities like syntactic style and memory recall, with average performance considerably below human baseline.

Conclusion: LLMs still have significant limitations in persona simulation capabilities, particularly in syntactic style and memory recall, indicating substantial room for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

*Run Peng,Ziqiao Ma,Amy Pang,Sikai Li,Zhang Xi-Jia,Yingzhuo Yu,Cristian-Paul Bara,Joyce Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies LLM agent collaboration under information asymmetry using an extended Einstein Puzzles game, showing that aligned communication and environment verification improve task performance and rule understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLM agents' abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve joint goals under information asymmetry conditions, where agents have disparities in knowledge and skills.

Method: Extended Einstein Puzzles to a table-top game where two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints. Applied a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework with various communication strategies and verification signals.

Result: Aligned communication is critical when agents have both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Agents without communication can achieve high task performance but lack true rule understanding and receive lower human trust. Environment-based verifiers enhance rule comprehension and task completion.

Conclusion: Integrating environment-based verifiers enhances agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

TL;DR: FARSIQA is a novel system for faithful Persian Islamic question answering that uses an adaptive, iterative RAG framework to address hallucination and improve accuracy in complex multi-hop queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail on complex multi-hop queries in specialized domains like religious QA, particularly for Persian-speaking Muslims where accuracy and faithfulness to authoritative sources are critical.

Method: FAIR-RAG architecture: Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework that dynamically decomposes queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and iteratively generates sub-queries to fill information gaps using a curated Islamic knowledge base.

Result: Achieved 97.0% in Negative Rejection (40-point improvement over baselines) and 74.3% Answer Correctness on IslamicPCQA benchmark, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Establishes new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that iterative, adaptive architecture is crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: This paper empirically studies test-time scaling (TTS) methods for legal multiple-choice QA, evaluating verifier-based approaches across five benchmarks using 7 reward models under realistic low-N budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While TTS has proven effective in formal domains like mathematics and programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains underexplored.

Method: The study uses verifier-based TTS methods including outcome-level (Best-of-N) and process-level (tree search) verification, evaluated with a family of 7 reward models across five legal MCQA benchmarks under low-N budgets.

Result: The analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties including domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when applied across different roles.

Conclusion: The research provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness of TTS techniques in legal domains and identifies key factors influencing verifier performance in argumentative reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluating language model reasoning efficiency by measuring how well they avoid unnecessary inferences when solving problems with irrelevant information, using logic programming alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluations focus only on correctness but overlook efficiency, which is crucial for human-like reasoning where much information is irrelevant and needs to be ignored.

Method: Introduce a framework using logic programming to align natural language proofs from LMs with shortest proofs, quantifying efficiency by measuring unnecessary inference avoidance. Create dataset of math word problems with irrelevant axioms.

Result: Current LMs show significant accuracy declines even with minimal domain-consistent distractions, and their proofs frequently contain detours through irrelevant inferences.

Conclusion: Reasoning efficiency is a critical but overlooked aspect of LM evaluation, and current models struggle with filtering irrelevant information during deductive reasoning.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Motivation: Current LLMs have limited ability to analyze Electronic Health Records due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities, creating a gap in automated clinical decision-making.

Method: Developed a thinking-graph-driven framework to generate EHR-Ins dataset with 300k reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 tasks. Built EHR-R1 models using multi-stage training including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning.

Result: EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving 10% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

Conclusion: The EHR-Ins dataset, EHR-R1 models, and EHR-Bench benchmark collectively advance the development of more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis systems.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

*Jiani Zheng,Zhiyang Teng,Xiangtai Li,Anran Wang,Yu Tian,Kunpeng Qiu,Ye Tian,Haochen Wang,Zhuochen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PairUni is a unified framework that organizes vision-language data into understanding-generation pairs and uses pair-aware reinforcement learning to balance these tasks in unified models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UVLMs need to handle both understanding and generation tasks, but these tasks use different data and supervision, making it challenging to balance them during RL training without causing task interference.

Method: Uses GPT-o3 to augment data by generating captions for understanding samples and QA pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs. Also retrieves semantically related examples to create retrieved pairs. Introduces Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization that uses similarity scores to modulate advantages and reduce task interference.

Result: Achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Curated a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The PairUni framework successfully addresses the challenge of balancing understanding and generation tasks in UVLMs through structured data pairing and pair-aware optimization, leading to improved performance across different vision-language models.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

*Saeed AlMarri,Kristof Juhasz,Mathieu Ravaut,Gautier Marti,Hamdan Al Ahbabi,Ibrahim Elfadel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares zero-shot LLM classifiers with LightGBM for loan default prediction, finding LLMs have limitations in structured financial data and unreliable self-explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' suitability for structured tabular data in high-stakes financial applications like risk assessment, where their performance and explainability remain underexplored.

Method: Systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM classifiers and LightGBM on real-world loan default prediction, using SHAP for feature attribution analysis and assessing LLM self-explanations.

Result: LLMs can identify key financial risk indicators but their feature importance rankings diverge from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often don't align with empirical SHAP attributions.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction, requiring explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human oversight in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Toolathlon is a comprehensive benchmark for language agents that spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, featuring realistic initial environment states and 108 complex multi-step tasks requiring around 20 tool calls on average to complete.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language agent benchmarks focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity needed to evaluate real-world agent performance across complex workflows.

Method: Created a benchmark with diverse Apps and tools based on Model Context Protocol servers, realistic initial environment states from real software, and 108 manually crafted tasks requiring multi-App interactions with strict verification through evaluation scripts.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant shortcomings: Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieves only 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calls on average, while top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%.

Conclusion: Toolathlon addresses the gap in realistic agent evaluation and is expected to drive development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from unlearned LLMs, with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating unlearning effectiveness in LLMs is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, but remains an open problem.

Method: Introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB) based on ACT-R and Hebbian theory, modeling information entanglement via domain graphs and testing factual recall with persuasive framing. Develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation patterns.

Result: Persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size.

Conclusion: SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro is a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models that integrate reasoning into pre-training through iterative latent computation and entropy-regularized depth allocation, achieving superior performance with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on explicit text generation for reasoning (like chain-of-thought), which defers reasoning to post-training and under-utilizes pre-training data.

Method: Three key components: (i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens during pre-training.

Result: Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models match the performance of up to 12B SOTA LLMs across various benchmarks, with advantages stemming from superior knowledge manipulation rather than increased capacity.

Conclusion: LoopLM represents a novel scaling direction for reasoning capabilities, with reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit chain-of-thought approaches.

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from one-shot task completion agents to collaborative agents that work iteratively with humans, introducing collaborative effort scaling as a framework to measure how agent utility grows with user involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations focus on one-shot task completion, failing to account for the iterative and collaborative nature of real-world problems where human goals are often underspecified and evolve over time.

Method: Introduces collaborative effort scaling framework to capture how agent utility grows with increasing user involvement, using case studies and simulated evaluations.

Result: State-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing they lack the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.

Conclusion: Collaborative effort scaling provides a diagnostic lens for agent behavior and guides development toward more effective human-agent interactions throughout the problem-solving process.

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

*Chumeng Liang,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric for LLM-generated demonstration diagrams that treats diagrams as graphs and uses node alignment and path alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure, and there's a lack of discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating LLM-generated diagrams.

Method: Conceptualizes diagrams as graphs with text elements as nodes and connections as directed edges, then evaluates using node alignment and path alignment metrics.

Result: Effectively evaluated diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of the proposed metrics.

Conclusion: DiagramEval provides enhanced explainability and offers valuable insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams, addressing the gap in diagram evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc attribution methods struggle with multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive QA where answers synthesize information across passages, requiring better attribution reliability.

Method: Reframe attribution as reasoning problem, use DecompTune - post-training with two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline on curated dataset of complex QA tasks annotated with decompositions.

Result: Substantially improves attribution quality, outperforms prior methods and matches/exceeds state-of-the-art frontier models in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Teaching models to produce answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps effectively improves attribution reliability in complex QA settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Result: Found that linguistic quality filtering enhances text fluency but yields subpar benchmark results, while late deliberate contamination recovers competitive scores with reasonable generation quality harm. Neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage.

Conclusion: Gaperon establishes a reproducible foundation for exploring trade-offs between data curation, evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development through complete open release of all components.

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language

trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

Motivation: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is challenging due to complex dynamics and sparse views, with existing methods struggling to balance quality and efficiency.

Method: Uses a lightweight residual flow network to predict non-rigid motion of dynamic objects on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. Employs coarse-to-fine training to avoid end-to-end instability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes dataset, generating high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online from only two images.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves real-time, high-fidelity 4D dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse views, advancing both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,

on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

TL;DR: M-ACM is a motion-augmented caption model that improves video captioning by incorporating motion-aware decoding from human mesh recovery, reducing hallucinations and enhancing semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning models struggle with capturing fine-grained motion details, leading to vague or semantically inconsistent captions for human actions.

Method: Uses motion representations from human mesh recovery to explicitly highlight human body dynamics through motion-aware decoding in a generative framework.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting new standards for motion-centric video captioning.

Conclusion: M-ACM demonstrates that incorporating motion-aware decoding with human mesh recovery effectively enhances caption quality for human action descriptions in videos.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

TL;DR: Training Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition on SAR images using synthetic data from simulators to overcome lack of real labeled data, and combining complementary simulators to improve generalization on real measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of real labeled SAR measurements by using synthetic data from simulators, but recognize that simulations have limitations in representing real world due to simplifying assumptions, leading to poor generalization of ATR models on real data.

Method: Combine two SAR simulators with different paradigms - MOCEM (scattering centers model) and Salsa (ray tracing strategy) - to generate synthetic datasets. Train ATR models using these combined datasets with the ADASCA Deep Learning approach.

Result: Achieved nearly 88% accuracy on MSTAR real measurements, demonstrating improved generalization capability when using complementary simulation approaches.

Conclusion: Combining multiple SAR simulators with different physical modeling paradigms can effectively bridge the simulation-to-reality gap and enable successful ATR model training on synthetic data that generalizes well to real SAR measurements.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a machine learning framework using Random Forest and XGBoost to evaluate point-level uncertainty in MLS point clouds by learning relationships between local geometric features and point errors, achieving ROC-AUC >0.87.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty modeling requires high-precision reference data that is costly and infeasible for large-scale MLS applications, creating a need for alternative approaches.

Method: Uses ensemble learning models (RF and XGBoost) trained on spatially partitioned real-world datasets to learn nonlinear relationships between geometric features and point-level uncertainty.

Result: Both models effectively captured nonlinear relationships with mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87, identifying elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity as key uncertainty predictors.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach for uncertainty evaluation in large-scale point clouds, offering foundation for future quality control and error analysis.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

TL;DR: A multimodal framework using eye-tracking and facial features for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis achieves 95.11% accuracy through cross-attention fusion and directional convolution modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention. Eye-tracking and facial features provide complementary cognitive indicators, but few studies have explored their joint integration for AD diagnosis.

Method: Proposed a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework with: (a) Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) for inter-modal interactions via cross-attention and global enhancement, and (b) Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) for fine-grained directional facial features using horizontal-vertical receptive fields.

Result: Achieved 95.11% classification accuracy in distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls, outperforming traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods. Used a synchronized multimodal dataset of 25 AD patients and 25 healthy controls.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions, highlighting the value of synergistic multimodal integration for AD detection.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Codec Avatar models impose significant computational demands that make real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR devices where latency and power efficiency are critical.

Method: Proposed efficient post-training quantization for Codec Avatar models and designed a custom hardware accelerator integrated into VR system-on-chip, combined into the ESCA full-stack optimization framework.

Result: ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to +0.39 over best 4-bit baseline, delivers 3.36× latency reduction, and sustains 100 FPS rendering rate in end-to-end tests.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate feasibility of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices, enabling more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

TL;DR: Vision models achieve comparable performance to GNNs on graph benchmarks but with different learning patterns, and significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs operate through bottom-up message-passing, differing from human visual perception that captures global structures first. Existing benchmarks conflate domain features with topological understanding.

Method: Introduced GraphAbstract benchmark to evaluate models' ability to perceive global graph properties like recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements.

Result: Vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size.

Conclusion: Vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning, opening new avenues for developing more effective graph foundation models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method for multi-view data that combines graph fusion, pseudo-labeling, and topological corrections to improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with multi-view data due to lack of clear graph structures and complexity of integrating graph structures across views.

Method: Combines linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion in GCN framework, uses dynamic pseudo-labeling, corrects topological imbalances, and adds unsupervised smoothing loss.

Result: Outperforms existing semi-supervised learning approaches on multi-view benchmark image datasets.

Conclusion: RSGSLM effectively addresses multi-view learning challenges while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench is a multilingual vision-language benchmark derived from expert-created PISA tests, covering six languages with human-verified examples to address limitations in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing vision-language benchmarks that rely on synthetic LLM-generated content and are mostly English-only, by creating a high-quality, multilingual benchmark with human-verified examples.

Method: Derived examples from English PISA tests (expert-created student competency assessments), extracted human-verified instructions, questions, answer options, and images, then translated them into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, Italian) to create a fully parallel multilingual corpus.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs showed that small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores, substantial performance degradation on non-English splits, and high error rates on spatial and geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PISA-Bench provides a valuable resource for advancing multilingual multimodal reasoning research, highlighting current limitations in model performance across languages and reasoning types.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models face deployment challenges due to substantial computational and data requirements from their large-scale foundation models, creating an urgent need to address these efficiency bottlenecks.

Method: Introduces a unified taxonomy organizing techniques into three pillars: Efficient Model Design (architectures and compression), Efficient Training (reducing computational burdens), and Efficient Data Collection (addressing robotic data acquisition bottlenecks).

Result: Establishes a foundational reference framework, summarizes representative applications, delineates key challenges, and provides a roadmap for future research in efficient VLA development.

Conclusion: The survey creates a systematic organization of efficient VLA techniques and maintains an updated project page to track ongoing developments in this emerging field.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We

### [78] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models exhibit human-like conflict adaptation behavior in Stroop tasks, with neural analysis revealing specialized supernodes for text/color processing and a conflict-modulated supernode that regulates cognitive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models demonstrate human-like cognitive control mechanisms, specifically conflict adaptation, and understand the neural representations underlying this behavior.

Method: Used sequential Stroop task with 13 vision-language models, analyzed representations using sparse autoencoders on InternVL 3.5 4B to identify task-relevant supernodes.

Result: 12 of 13 VLMs showed conflict adaptation behavior; identified overlapping text/color supernodes in early/late layers with size asymmetry mirroring human automaticity; isolated conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation increases Stroop errors.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit human-like cognitive control mechanisms, with specialized neural representations for conflict processing that parallel human cognitive architecture.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [79] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap is a lightweight retrieval-augmented image captioning model that uses dual retrieval (image-to-text and image-to-image) to generate both text prompts and visual prompts from retrieved similar images, enhancing visual representation without heavy parameter requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight retrieval-augmented caption models only use retrieved data as text prompts, creating a semantic gap by leaving original visual features unenhanced, especially for object details and complex scenes.

Method: Uses dual retrieval mechanism: standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and novel image-to-image retrieval for visually similar scenes. Extracts salient keywords/phrases from captions of similar scenes, encodes them, and integrates with original image features through a lightweight trainable feature fusion network.

Result: Achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.

Conclusion: DualCap effectively bridges the semantic gap in lightweight retrieval-augmented captioning by enriching visual representation through dual retrieval and feature fusion, achieving strong performance with reduced parameter requirements.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage deep learning framework combining vision backbones, ML classifiers, and feature selection achieves 85.99% accuracy for fish freshness assessment, outperforming previous methods by 8.69-22.78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensory evaluation of fish freshness is subjective and inconsistent, while existing deep learning methods lack accuracy and feature transparency.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tune five vision architectures, 2) Extract multi-level features for seven ML classifiers, 3) Apply feature selection methods (LGBM, Random Forest, Lasso) to identify compact feature subsets.

Result: Best configuration (Swin-Tiny features + Extra Trees classifier + LGBM feature selection) achieves 85.99% accuracy on FFE dataset, outperforming recent studies by 8.69-22.78%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and generalizable for visual quality evaluation tasks, providing reliable fish freshness assessment.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video fake news detection benchmarks focus only on final accuracy without providing fine-grained assessment of the detection process, making it a black box. There's a need for comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' capabilities in video fake news detection.

Method: Created MVFNDB benchmark with 10 tasks and 9730 human-annotated video questions based on taxonomy of VFND abilities. Designed MVFND-CoT framework that incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage reasoning. Analyzed video processing strategies and feature-model capability alignment.

Conclusion: The MVFNDB benchmark lays solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements of MLLMs in video fake news detection domain, enabling deeper analysis of factors influencing detection accuracy.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

TL;DR: A multi-round safety editing framework for text-to-image models that addresses over-refusal and safety-utility imbalance through post-hoc editing using a specialized dataset and unified MLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time safety methods for text-to-image models suffer from over-refusal and poor balance between safety and utility, requiring a more effective solution.

Method: Proposed MR-SafeEdit framework with multi-round image-text dataset and SafeEditor MLLM that performs post-hoc safety editing through iterative refinement process.

Result: SafeEditor outperforms prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving better safety-utility balance in text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: The multi-round safety editing framework provides an effective model-agnostic solution for safety alignment in text-to-image models, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Method: Uses adversarial autoencoders (AAE) for each modality to learn discriminative emotion features, Cross-modal Gate Mechanism (CGMM) to reduce modality discrepancies and establish emotional relationships, and Feature Fusion module (FFM) for multimodal fusion.

Result: Experiments on SIMS and MOSI datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MCIHN effectively addresses modality differences and improves multimodal emotion recognition through cross-modal interaction and feature learning.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

*Anne Gagneux,Ségolène Martin,Rémi Gribonval,Mathurin Massias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes flow matching from a denoising perspective, establishing formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers to understand generation quality factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching has achieved success but the factors influencing generation quality remain poorly understood, motivating a denoising-based analysis framework.

Method: Developed a framework connecting flow matching models with denoisers, enabling principled perturbations (noise and drift) to probe the generation process and identify distinct dynamical phases.

Result: Revealed distinct dynamical phases in the generative process, enabling precise characterization of when denoisers succeed or fail during generation.

Conclusion: The denoising perspective provides new insights into flow matching generation processes, allowing better understanding of performance factors and failure modes.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

*Sidharth Rai,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Benjamin Vail,Keziban Yalçın Dokumacı,Ajay Sharda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes fruit maturity estimation from discrete classification to continuous probabilistic learning, proposing a probabilistic head for RT-DETRv2 that predicts continuous maturity distributions with uncertainty measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches treat maturity as discrete classes, which conflicts with the continuous nature of biological ripening, causing information loss and ambiguous class boundaries.

Method: Proposed architectural modification to RT-DETRv2 by adding a dedicated probabilistic head that predicts continuous distribution over maturity spectrum, learning mean maturity state and associated uncertainty.

Result: Achieved 85.6% mAP on challenging fruit dataset while providing richer biological representation and more granular maturity assessments than classification-based methods.

Conclusion: Probabilistic approach enables more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems for agriculture, with uncertainty measures crucial for robotic decision-making like selective harvesting.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight body landmark detection with optimized landmark subset selection achieves comparable or superior LIBRAS sign recognition performance while reducing processing time by 5X compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous skeleton-based approaches using OpenPose achieved good recognition performance but had poor time performance. Simply replacing OpenPose with lightweight MediaPipe improved speed but significantly reduced accuracy.

Method: Used landmark subset selection strategies to optimize recognition performance, combined with spline-based imputation to handle missing landmarks.

Result: Proper landmark subset achieved comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X. Spline-based imputation effectively mitigated missing landmark issues with substantial accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Careful landmark selection combined with simple imputation techniques enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language Recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address traffic congestion challenges in growing urban cities by developing efficient traffic flow optimization solutions.

Method: Analyze sequential camera frames to compute background by averaging pixel values, then extract foreground and apply DBSCAN clustering for vehicle detection.

Result: Computationally efficient vehicle detection with minimal infrastructure modification requirements.

Conclusion: Practical and scalable solution suitable for real-world deployment in traffic management systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: VividCam enables text-to-video models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos instead of real training data, using disentanglement strategies to isolate motion learning from synthetic artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models struggle with unconventional camera motions due to insufficient training data with such motions, limiting artistic video creation.

Method: Proposes VividCam training paradigm using synthetic videos from engines like Unity, with multiple disentanglement strategies to isolate camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts.

Result: Synthesizes wide range of precisely controlled complex camera motions using simple synthetic data (basic geometries in low-poly 3D scenes), achieving robust motion representation.

Conclusion: VividCam successfully enables learning complex camera motions from synthetic data, overcoming the challenge of finding sufficient real training videos with unconventional camera motions.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the inner workings of multi-view transformers like DUSt3R by probing their residual connections to understand how 3D representations develop across layers and how they differ from methods with explicit pose priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view transformers are becoming state-of-the-art for 3D vision tasks but operate as black boxes, making improvements challenging and limiting their use in safety-critical applications where interpretability is essential.

Method: The authors develop an approach to probe and visualize 3D representations from the residual connections of multi-view transformers' layers, specifically analyzing a DUSt3R variant to understand latent state development across blocks.

Result: The analysis reveals how DUSt3R's latent representations evolve across layers, shows the role of individual layers, and demonstrates that the model refines correspondences using reconstructed geometry rather than relying on explicit pose priors.

Conclusion: The probing method provides interpretability for multi-view transformers, showing they develop 3D representations differently from traditional methods with strong inductive biases, and enables better understanding of their internal mechanisms.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

*Hossein R. Nowdeh,Jie Ji,Xiaolong Ma,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-SAM is a model-agnostic framework that addresses modality dominance in multimodal learning by identifying dominant modalities using Shapley values, modulating the loss landscape to prioritize robustness of dominant modalities, and updating weights via modulated gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting generalization capabilities and preventing models from effectively leveraging complementary features across different modalities.

Method: Three-step iterative optimization: 1) Identify dominant modality using Shapley values based on modality contributions to accuracy, 2) Decompose loss landscape to prioritize robustness for dominant modality, 3) Update weights through backpropagation of modulated gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show M-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods, significantly balancing and improving multimodal learning performance.

Conclusion: M-SAM effectively addresses modality dominance by ensuring robust learning for dominant modalities while enhancing contributions from others, enabling models to better explore and exploit complementary features for improved overall performance.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Result: Achieved nearly 99% movement recognition accuracy, with comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirming significant effectiveness.

Conclusion: The IBIS hybrid architecture successfully addresses overfitting in Wi-Fi sensing, demonstrating high accuracy and robust generalization for movement recognition applications.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and

self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning strategy with semi-supervised learning effectively enhances ALPR performance while reducing manual labeling requirements, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised

pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models require expensive large-scale pretraining, creating efficiency concerns that discourage training from scratch.

Method: Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP) adapts to input images and dynamically merges tokens in deeper visual encoder layers.

Result: Significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance on ImageNet and CLIP pretraining; validated on large biology dataset.

Conclusion: DRIP provides an efficient approach to vision-language model training with reduced computational costs while preserving performance.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive

Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise facial attribute control in PSTF approaches, while tuning-based methods require technical expertise and additional training data, limiting accessibility.

Method: Uses face recognition model to extract identity features, maps them to StyleGAN2's W+ latent space via e4e encoder, and integrates Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module to separate identity and attribute information in UNet architecture.

Result: Successfully generates personalized images with fine-grained facial attribute control while preserving identity, without requiring additional fine-tuning or training data for individual identities.

Conclusion: The approach balances personalization with precise facial attribute control, offering an efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality facial image synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

### [101] [Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094)
*Chanhyeong Yang,Taehoon Song,Jihwan Park,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDRP is a framework for zero-shot human-object interaction detection that addresses visual complexity through visual diversity-aware prompt learning and region-aware concepts to handle intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches using pretrained vision-language models like CLIP fail to handle the visual complexity of interactions, particularly intra-class visual diversity (same verb appearing in different poses/contexts) and inter-class visual entanglement (different verbs having similar visual patterns).

Method: Proposes VDRP with two key components: (1) Visual diversity-aware prompt learning that injects group-wise visual variance into context embeddings using Gaussian perturbation, and (2) Region-aware prompts that retrieve concepts from human, object, and union regions to enhance verb-level discrimination.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Conclusion: The VDRP framework successfully handles the visual complexity in zero-shot human-object interaction detection through diversity-aware and region-aware prompt learning strategies.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting for smooth indoor/urban scene reconstruction that preserves details and efficiency while handling low-texture regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric priors lack global consistency for low-texture regions, and Gaussian Splatting/SDF methods suffer from discontinuities or inefficiencies, losing detail.

Method: Uses Atlanta-world model for accurate surface reconstruction in low-texture areas, with novel implicit-structured GS representations including semantic GS for probability prediction and structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves smooth reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency, effectively addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

### [103] [Region-CAM: Towards Accurate Object Regions in Class Activation Maps for Weakly Supervised Learning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25134)
*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM is a novel activation method that improves upon conventional CAM by generating more complete object coverage and better boundary alignment through semantic information maps and propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM methods only highlight the most discriminative regions, failing to cover entire objects and misaligning with boundaries, which limits performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks.

Method: Region-CAM extracts semantic information maps (SIMs) and performs semantic information propagation (SIP) using both gradients and features from all stages of the baseline classification model, rather than just network feature weighting.

Result: Significant improvements over original CAM: 60.12% mIoU on PASCAL VOC training (vs 46.51%), 58.43% on validation (vs 45.30%), and 36.38% on MS COCO validation (vs 20.15%). Also achieves 51.7% Top-1 Localization accuracy on ILSVRC2012, outperforming LayerCAM by 4.5%.

Conclusion: Region-CAM effectively addresses limitations of conventional CAM by providing more complete object coverage and precise boundary alignment, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid

maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReGap, a training-free method for detecting AI-generated images by computing dynamic reconstruction error through controlled perturbations, addressing limitations of existing reconstruction-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction-based methods for detecting AI-generated images lack theoretical foundations, rely on empirical heuristics, and have limited interpretability and reliability. They fail when real images exhibit lower reconstruction error than generated ones.

Method: Proposes ReGap which computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations, measuring error changes before and after editing to enhance error separation.

Result: Experimental results show ReGap outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing operations, and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed ReGap method provides a more reliable and accurate approach for detecting AI-generated images by addressing fundamental limitations of static reconstruction error methods through dynamic error measurement.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision transformer-based approach for real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles from interferograms, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and enabling automated thickness reconstruction for clinical applications like dry eye diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical translation of thin film interferometry is hindered by challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase periodicity, noise, and artifacts. Traditional methods are computationally intensive, noise-sensitive, or require manual expert analysis.

Method: Vision transformer-based approach trained on hybrid dataset combining physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data. Leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass from dynamic interferograms.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and iterative fitting methods. Enables automated, consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: The data-driven approach opens new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as dry eye disease, providing a practical solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

TL;DR: TGBFN is a novel framework for quantitatively constrained CAD generation that handles multi-modal CAD sequences in a unified continuous parameter space using guided Bayesian flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lag in multi-modal data generation like parametric CAD sequences due to challenges with long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity.

Method: TGBFN handles discrete commands and continuous parameters in a unified continuous space, introduces guided Bayesian flow to control CAD properties, and constructs a new dataset for evaluation.

Result: TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TGBFN framework successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal CAD generation and demonstrates superior performance in constrained generation tasks.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

TL;DR: D²GS is a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework that uses multi-view depth predictions and diffusion priors to achieve geometry quality comparable to LiDAR-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene reconstruction methods rely on multimodal sensors (LiDAR + images), which face challenges with spatiotemporal calibration and reprojection errors. This work aims to eliminate the need for accurate LiDAR data while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Initialize dense point cloud from multi-view depth predictions with Progressive Pruning for global consistency; 2) Joint refinement of Gaussian geometry and depth via Depth Enhancer using diffusion priors; 3) Ground geometry improvement by constraining Gaussian attributes in road regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo dataset show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and produces more accurate geometry than methods using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: The proposed D²GS framework successfully achieves LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction with geometry quality comparable to or better than LiDAR-based methods, eliminating the practical challenges of LiDAR data acquisition.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that dynamically adjusts semantic segmentation classifiers using both dataset-level and image-level contextual information to address class imbalance and improve pixel-level classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard semantic segmentation methods use fixed-parameter classifiers that cannot adapt to individual image characteristics or handle class imbalance, leading to biased results favoring majority classes.

Method: ECAC uses a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual information and incorporates image-specific contextual information. It employs a teacher-student network where the teacher dynamically adjusts contextual information using ground truth and transfers knowledge to the student.

Result: The proposed ECAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets including ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment of classifiers using both global and local contextual information significantly improves semantic segmentation performance, especially for handling class imbalance and adapting to individual image characteristics.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

TL;DR: A foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates source data dependency and overcomes closed-set limitations using multi-modal prompt tuning and instance dynamic memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptive object detection methods heavily rely on source data and assume identical category spaces between source and target domains, which limits real-world applicability.

Method: Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework with text and visual prompt tuning, Test-time Warm-start strategy for visual prompts, and Instance Dynamic Memory module with Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks, adapting to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully eliminates source data dependency, overcomes traditional closed-set limitations, and demonstrates superior performance in test-time adaptive object detection across various domain shifts.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently

enabling online education to seamlessly align with the swift evolution of the
educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-CAN is an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising using Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching, achieving comparable results to supervised methods without requiring clean-noisy pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from scanning sensors often contain noise that negatively impacts downstream tasks. Previous supervised methods require extensive manual effort to collect noisy-clean pairs, motivating the need for unsupervised approaches.

Method: U-CAN uses a neural network to infer multi-step denoising paths with Noise2Noise matching, employing a novel loss for statistical reasoning on multiple noisy observations and a consistency-aware denoising constraint that generalizes to 2D image denoising.

Result: U-CAN shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising benchmarks, producing comparable results to supervised methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework with consistency-aware constraints effectively addresses point cloud denoising without requiring clean-noisy pairs, with potential applications beyond 3D domain to 2D image denoising.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Net is a novel photometric stereo framework that uses multi-stage feature extraction with selective update strategy and feature fusion to improve surface normal estimation accuracy, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo methods fail to capture features at multiple stages and lack adequate feature interaction, leading to redundant feature extraction especially in complex areas like wrinkles and edges.

Method: Proposed MSF-Net with multi-stage feature extraction, selective update strategy to extract high-quality features, and feature fusion module to improve interaction between different features.

Result: Experimental results on DiLiGenT benchmark show MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed MSF-Net framework effectively addresses limitations in existing photometric stereo methods by improving multi-stage feature extraction and feature interaction, leading to superior performance in surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

TL;DR: A new SFDA framework using hard sample selection and denoised patch mixing to improve medical image segmentation under privacy constraints by progressively aligning target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA approaches ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain shift, limiting their effectiveness for medical image segmentation.

Method: Partitions unlabeled images into reliable/unreliable subsets via entropy-similarity analysis, refines pseudo-labels with Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, and uses intra-/inter-domain patch mixing objectives.

Result: Achieves consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods with more accurate boundary delineation and state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Progressive adaptation and denoised supervision are crucial for robust medical image segmentation under domain shift in privacy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

### [118] [Balanced conic rectified flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25229)
*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved rectified flow method that incorporates real images during training to reduce computational costs and address bias issues in the original rectified flow approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow faces challenges: 1) requires large generative pairs for reflow (high computational cost), 2) performance depends heavily on 1-rectified flow model, causing bias towards generated data.

Method: Incorporates real images into training process, preserves ODE paths for real images, uses smaller set of generated and real images for efficient reflow.

Result: Achieved significantly better FID scores on CIFAR-10 in both one-step generation and full-step simulations, using only a fraction of generative pairs compared to original method. Induces straighter paths and avoids saturation on generated images.

Conclusion: The approach enables more robust ODE learning while preserving real image distribution, effectively reducing reliance on large amounts of generated data.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for generating emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by modeling facial animation as a linear additive problem, combining speech-driven lip-sync with emotion-driven expressions using sparse constraints for disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets, and generating emotionally expressive talking faces remains underexplored despite recent progress in speech-driven lip-sync. The high cost of data capture makes it difficult to obtain comprehensive emotional 3D talking-face data.

Method: Model facial animation as a linear additive problem using a 3D talking-face dataset with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a 3D expression sequence dataset (Florence4D). Learn speech and emotion blendshapes jointly with sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement while capturing cross-domain deformations. The learned blendshapes are mapped to FLAME model parameters for 3D Gaussian avatar animation.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the method naturally generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies demonstrate superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods without compromising lip-sync quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of emotional 3D talking-face generation by leveraging available neutral and expression datasets through a linear additive model with sparsity constraints, achieving both high emotional expressivity and accurate lip-sync.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform well in in-domain scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to reliance on forgery-specific artifacts, raising concerns about misuse for fraud and misinformation.

Method: Enhances CLIP-ViT encoder with two components: Local Patch Guidance (LPG) for spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision, and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD) for domain feature augmentation through domain-bridging and boundary-expanding feature generation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Conclusion: DeepShield demonstrates that integrating novel local and global analysis approaches significantly improves deepfake detection robustness across diverse manipulation techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models were evaluated for classifying Trees Outside Forests (TOF) using high-resolution aerial imagery, with FT-UNetFormer achieving the best performance (mean IoU 0.74, F1 score 0.84) in mapping four woody vegetation categories across German agricultural landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TOF are important for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and microclimate regulation, but current approaches treat TOF as a single class or use rigid thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and regional adaptability.

Method: Compared CNN, vision transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet, LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, U-Net) using a new dataset from four German agricultural landscapes to classify four TOF categories: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree.

Result: Models achieved good classification accuracy overall, with FT-UNetFormer performing best. Forest and Linear classes showed good results, while Patch and Tree classes were challenging due to complex structures with high edge density. Generalization experiments revealed the need for regionally diverse training data.

Conclusion: Deep learning, particularly FT-UNetFormer, effectively maps TOF categories, emphasizing the importance of spatial context understanding. Reliable large-scale mapping requires regionally diverse training data to address classification challenges in complex vegetation structures.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

TL;DR: A distillation framework using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object detectors without increasing deployment overhead, achieving state-of-the-art results on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight network designs for real-time object detection often degrade feature representation, limiting performance improvements and practical on-device deployment. The paper aims to leverage VFMs' capabilities to enhance lightweight detectors.

Method: Proposes a distillation framework with two key components: Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module for integrating VFM representations into detector layers, and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) strategy for dynamic adjustment of semantic transfer intensity based on gradient norm ratios.

Result: RT-DETRv4 model family achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO with AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS respectively, demonstrating consistent performance gains across DETR-based models without deployment overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances lightweight object detectors by leveraging VFMs through semantic injection and adaptive modulation, delivering significant performance improvements for real-time detection applications.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding

Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping for object-part segmentation, by leveraging MLLM's rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Integrates MLLM into object-part parsing pipeline to ground object-part hierarchies in language space and link multi-granularity concepts within hierarchies using language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven part query refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 5.5% AP improvement (in-domain) and 4.8% AP (cross-dataset) on PartImageNet, and 2.5% mIOU improvement on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot).

Conclusion: LangHOPS demonstrates the effectiveness of language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven part query refinement for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation, outperforming previous methods across multiple challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the

*Yuyang Huang,Yabo Chen,Junyu Zhou,Wenrui Dai,Xiaopeng Zhang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTM is a novel generation-based SFDA framework that uses diffusion models to progressively refine pseudo-target domains, addressing domain discrepancy limitations in source-free domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods struggle with large domain discrepancies - non-generation methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels, while generation-based methods degrade due to enlarged domain gaps when creating pseudo-source data.

Method: Divides target samples into trust/non-trust sets based on pseudo-label reliability, uses latent diffusion model to semantically transform non-trust samples while maintaining target distribution, and employs progressive refinement to iteratively reduce domain discrepancy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by large margin, achieves SOTA on four SFDA benchmark datasets, and improves performance by up to 18.6% in large domain gap scenarios.

Conclusion: DPTM effectively addresses SFDA limitations by leveraging target data as references to generate and progressively refine pseudo-target domains, demonstrating superior performance especially in challenging large domain gap scenarios.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

*Zongxi Yu,Xiaolong Qian,Shaohua Gao,Qi Jiang,Yao Gao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A bio-inspired monocentric lens system (BMI) that jointly recovers high-quality RGB images and depth maps from single coded captures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both depth estimation and image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional compact optics (poor RGB sharpness) and software-only monocular depth estimation (ill-posed problem with unreliable priors), while avoiding trade-offs of deep optics like fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations.

Method: Co-design of bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens with dual-head multi-scale reconstruction network. The optical design naturally encodes depth into depth-varying PSFs, and a physically-based forward model generates synthetic data for training a shared encoder that jointly recovers AiF images and depth maps.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: depth estimation (Abs Rel 0.026, RMSE 0.130) outperforms software-only approaches and other deep optics; image restoration (SSIM 0.960, LPIPS 0.082) shows superior balance between fidelity and accuracy.

Conclusion: Integration of bio-inspired spherical optics with joint reconstruction algorithm effectively addresses challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging, demonstrating a successful hardware-software co-design approach.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will

TL;DR: PDA is a lightweight plug-in metric head for DeFRCN that uses prototype-based matching to improve few-shot object detection by reducing base-class bias and improving calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot object detection suffers from base-class bias and unstable calibration when only limited novel samples are available, requiring complementary approaches to traditional linear classifiers.

Method: PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable projection space, uses prototype-conditioned RoI alignment, adapts prototypes via EMA updates during fine-tuning, and employs best-of-K matching with temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector logits.

Result: Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show PDA consistently improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: PDA provides an effective prototype-driven approach that enhances few-shot object detection by offering complementary metric-based classification while maintaining protocol compliance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

*Runxi Huang,Mingxuan Yu,Mingyu Tsoi,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge is a real-time multimodal inference framework for edge devices that uses pipelined sensing and encoding to reduce latency while maintaining accuracy through temporal aggregation and adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook the coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, and complex inter-modality dependencies, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Decomposes inference into fine-grained sensing/encoding units for incremental processing, uses temporal aggregation for accuracy, adaptive configuration optimizer for resource management, and cross-modal speculative skipping for early termination.

Result: Significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics, validated on multimodal datasets and UAV testbed.

Conclusion: MMEdge enables efficient real-time multimodal inference on edge devices through pipelined processing and adaptive optimization techniques.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingCoT is a new dataset for streaming VideoQA with temporally evolving reasoning and multimodal Chain-of-Thought annotations, addressing limitations in current datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA datasets have static annotations that don't capture evolving answers in temporal video streams, and lack explicit reasoning process annotations, limiting model interpretability and logical deduction.

Method: Dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture with per-second dense descriptions and temporally-dependent semantic segments, plus explicit reasoning chain generation using spatiotemporal object extraction, state transition-based reasoning paths with LLMs, and human-verified validation.

Result: Created StreamingCoT dataset with temporally evolving reasoning capabilities and multimodal CoT annotations, establishing foundation for streaming video understanding research.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT addresses critical limitations in current VideoQA datasets and provides a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

### [131] [Informative Sample Selection Model for Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25345)
*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised 3D action recognition using active learning, reformulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning to select the most informative skeleton sequences for annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in semi-supervised 3D action recognition using active learning may select representative but not necessarily informative skeleton sequences, as the model may have already learned similar patterns from previous samples. This leads to inefficient annotation resource utilization.

Method: The authors reformulate semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active learning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), train an informative sample selection model, project state-action pairs from Euclidean to hyperbolic space for enhanced representation, and introduce meta tuning for faster real-world deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in selecting truly informative skeleton sequences for annotation.

Conclusion: The MDP-based approach with hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning provides an effective framework for intelligent sample selection in semi-supervised 3D action recognition, improving annotation efficiency and model performance.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: Proposes radiomics-based pipeline with pseudo-labeling for CAC scoring from non-contrast CCTA scans, outperforming foundation model features without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited annotated data for coronary artery calcium scoring and leverage commonly available non-contrast CCTA scans for early calcification detection.

Method: Uses pseudo-labeling to generate training labels without expert segmentations, compares radiomics features with CT-FM and RadImageNet foundation model features, and tests on 182-patient dataset with zero vs non-zero calcium classification.

Result: Radiomics-based models achieved 84% accuracy and significantly outperformed CNN-derived embeddings from foundation models (p<0.05).

Conclusion: Radiomics approach with pseudo-labeling is effective for CAC scoring without expert annotations, demonstrating superior performance over foundation model features in non-contrast CCTA analysis.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT is a federated prompt tuning framework that achieves both generalization and personalization for Vision Transformers by using Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompts that adaptively combine class-specific prompts with global prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Prompt Tuning is effective for parameter-efficient fine-tuning but struggles in federated learning - global prompts don't generalize well across heterogeneous clients, while personalized prompts overfit to local data.

Method: Proposes PEP-FedPT with Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) that maintains class-specific prompts alongside global prompts, adaptively combining them using weights from global class prototypes and client class priors for per-sample personalization without client-dependent parameters.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist show PEP-FedPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT establishes a strong foundation for efficient and generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers, achieving both generalization and personalization simultaneously.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces i-CIR, a new instance-level composed image retrieval dataset with hard negatives, and proposes BASIC, a training-free method using pre-trained VLMs that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in composed image retrieval (CIR) is limited by the lack of high-quality training and evaluation data, especially for instance-level retrieval where the goal is to find the same particular object under various modifications.

Method: Proposes BASIC - a training-free approach using pre-trained vision-and-language models that separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, then performs late fusion to upweight images satisfying both queries while down-weighting those similar to only one.

Result: BASIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the new i-CIR dataset and existing semantic-level CIR datasets, demonstrating effectiveness without requiring training data.

Conclusion: The i-CIR dataset addresses the data scarcity problem in instance-level CIR, while BASIC provides an effective training-free solution that outperforms existing methods across different CIR benchmarks.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentAD is a training-free method that generates coherent Audio Descriptions by selecting from multiple candidates across sequences, outperforming independent generation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic AD methods generate descriptions independently, leading to repetitive and incoherent sequences that fail to help visually impaired audiences visualize unfolding scenes.

Method: Generate multiple candidate descriptions for each time interval, then perform auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form coherent narratives.

Result: The method produces coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding and outperforms prior independent generation approaches.

Conclusion: Sequence-level coherence in Audio Descriptions significantly improves narrative understanding for visually impaired audiences, and the proposed StoryRecall metric effectively evaluates AD sequences holistically.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Motivation: Underwater infrastructure inspection faces challenges with human divers and remotely operated vehicles due to perceptual limitations in complex structures and turbid water. Enhancing spatial awareness is crucial for reducing piloting risks and enabling autonomy.

Method: Two-stage approach: first scales relative depth map with sparse depth points, then refines metric prediction using Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves improved accuracy and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, runs efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: SPADE promises to support practical underwater inspection and intervention by providing reliable depth estimation in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs

Motivation: Liver structure segmentation in multi-phase CECT is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning of liver diseases including tumor detection.

Method: Evaluated UNet-based architectures with ResNet, Transformer, and Mamba backbones, then incorporated attention mechanisms including CBAM module to improve segmentation quality.

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved best performance: Dice 0.755, IoU 0.662, HD95 77.911, accuracy 0.925, specificity 0.926. ResNet consistently outperformed Transformer and Mamba alternatives.

Conclusion: Classical ResNet architecture combined with modern attention modules remains highly competitive for medical image segmentation, offering promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE is a region-aware image editing framework that accelerates instruction-based image editing by distinguishing between edited and unedited regions, using one-step prediction for unedited areas and optimized local denoising for edited regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing (IIE) models apply uniform generation processes to entire images, ignoring that edited and unedited regions have different generation difficulties and computational requirements, leading to inefficiency.

Method: RegionE framework includes: 1) Adaptive region partition based on difference between final estimated result and reference image, 2) Region-aware generation with one-step prediction for unedited regions and local iterative denoising with Region-Instruction KV Cache for edited regions, 3) Adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate local denoising.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art IIE models (Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit), RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06 respectively while preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity according to GPT-4o evaluations.

Conclusion: RegionE provides an effective region-aware framework that significantly accelerates instruction-based image editing without additional training, maintaining quality while improving efficiency by treating edited and unedited regions differently.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Motivation: Autoregressive image models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding. Speculative decoding works well for text but faces challenges in image generation due to larger sampling space and poor use of spatial structure.

Method: Hawk leverages the spatial structure of images to guide speculative model predictions, improving alignment between draft and target models and modeling local dependencies more effectively.

Result: Experimental results show 1.71x speedup over standard AR models on multiple text-to-image benchmarks while preserving image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: Hawk successfully adapts speculative decoding to image generation by utilizing spatial structure, achieving significant acceleration without quality degradation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: This survey offers comprehensive insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning and serves as a solid foundation for future research in this area.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D is a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation that repurposes pre-trained static 3D diffusion models as shape priors, extending Score Distillation Sampling to handle articulation as an additional generative dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated 3D objects are crucial for robotics, AR/VR, and animation, but existing methods either require dense-view supervision or produce coarse approximations without proper textures. Native 3D diffusion models for static objects have succeeded, but extending them to articulated objects through training poses significant challenges.

Method: FreeArt3D extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. It uses a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model as a shape prior and jointly optimizes geometry, texture, and articulation parameters from a few images captured in different articulation states.

Result: The method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. It completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and versatility.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D provides an effective training-free solution for articulated 3D generation that avoids the need for task-specific training or large-scale articulated datasets, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFXMaster is a unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation that treats effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling reproduction of diverse dynamic effects from reference videos with strong generalization to unseen effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX generation methods rely on one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and cannot generalize to unseen effects, limiting scalability and creative potential.

Method: Uses in-context conditioning strategy with reference videos, in-context attention masks to decouple and inject effect attributes, and one-shot effect adaptation mechanism for rapid generalization to tough unseen effects.

Result: Effectively imitates various categories of effect information and demonstrates outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VFXMaster provides a scalable solution for VFX generation that overcomes limitations of previous methods, with plans to release code, models, and comprehensive dataset to the community.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

*Qi Lin,Zhenyu Zhang,Viraj Thakkar,Zhenjie Sun,Mai Zheng,Zhichao Cao*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: StorageXTuner is an LLM agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines that separates concerns across four specialized agents to automatically configure storage systems more effectively than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically configuring storage systems is challenging due to large parameter spaces and varying conditions across workloads, deployments, and versions. Existing heuristic and ML tuners are often system-specific, require manual glue, and degrade under changes, while LLM-based approaches treat tuning as single-shot and system-specific.

Method: StorageXTuner uses four specialized agents: Executor (sandboxed benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management). It couples insight-driven tree search with layered memory that promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to guard against unsafe actions.

Result: Evaluation on RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C shows StorageXTuner reaches up to 575% and 111% higher throughput compared to out-of-the-box settings and ELMo-Tune, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and 56%, and converges with fewer trials.

Conclusion: StorageXTuner provides an effective LLM agent-driven framework for auto-tuning heterogeneous storage engines that outperforms existing approaches in throughput, latency reduction, and convergence efficiency across multiple storage systems and workloads.

Abstract: Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large
and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and
ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under
changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a
single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains
exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM
agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines.
StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed
benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided
configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management).
The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that
promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to
guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on
RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C.
Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up
to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and

### [144] [DMVFC: Deep Learning Based Functionally Consistent Tractography Fiber Clustering Using Multimodal Diffusion MRI and Functional MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24770)
*Bocheng Guo,Jin Wang,Yijie Li,Junyi Wang,Mingyu Gao,Puming Feng,Yuqian Chen,Jarrett Rushmore,Nikos Makris,Yogesh Rathi,Lauren J O'Donnell,Fan Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DMVFC is a deep learning framework that combines dMRI and fMRI data for white matter fiber clustering, integrating geometric, microstructural, and functional information to achieve functionally consistent parcellation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fiber clustering methods only use geometric characteristics and neglect functional and microstructural information, despite evidence that fMRI can measure neural activity in white matter and microstructural features like FA can ensure anatomical coherence.

Method: DMVFC has two components: (1) multi-view pretraining to compute embedding features from fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional signals separately, and (2) collaborative fine-tuning to simultaneously refine embedding differences.

Result: DMVFC demonstrated superior performance compared to two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent white matter parcellation results.

Conclusion: The proposed DMVFC framework effectively integrates multimodal information from dMRI and fMRI to enable functionally consistent white matter parcellation, outperforming existing methods that rely solely on geometric characteristics.

Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method
for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural
connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies
primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial
trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the
functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is
increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using
functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information
for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore,
microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed
from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the
clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering
framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint
multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM
parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural
characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber
tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining
module to compute embedding features from each source of information
separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional
signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine
the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two
state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance
in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized medical image classification faces data and privacy concerns, while standard FL struggles with heterogeneous data and high communication costs in large networks.

Method: Uses Top-k Sparsification to transmit only the top k gradients, reducing communication overhead while addressing data heterogeneity.

Result: Effectively reduces communication costs while maintaining model accuracy in non-IID medical imaging settings.

Conclusion: CFL-SparseMed enhances FL efficiency, preserves privacy, and improves diagnostic accuracy and patient care for medical image classification.

Abstract: Secure and reliable medical image classification is crucial for effective
patient treatment, but centralized models face challenges due to data and

Motivation: To create automated medical image reporting systems that generate clinically relevant captions for MRI scans, addressing the need for scalable and interpretable solutions in medical imaging.

Method: Uses DEiT-Small vision transformer as image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and custom LSTM-based decoder with hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive inference via vector similarity.

Result: Focusing on domain-specific data (filtered brain-only MRIs) improves caption accuracy and semantic alignment compared to general MRI images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like BLIP, R2GenGPT, and other transformer approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable, interpretable solution for automated medical image reporting that demonstrates improved performance when trained on domain-specific medical data.

Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically
relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision
transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a
custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align
image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive
inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe
dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI
images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including
BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that
focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic
alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated
medical image reporting.

*Anil Yildiz,Sarah M. Thornton,Carl Hildebrandt,Sreeja Roy-Singh,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOUT is a lightweight surrogate model that predicts scenario coverage labels from autonomous agents' sensor representations, eliminating the need for expensive human annotations or LVLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing scenario coverage rely on costly human annotations or computationally intensive LVLMs, making them impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and efficiency constraints.

Method: SCOUT is trained through distillation to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels, using precomputed perception features from agents' latent sensor representations to avoid redundant computations.

Result: Evaluation on real-life autonomous navigation scenarios shows SCOUT maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost, providing an effective alternative for large-scale coverage analysis.

Conclusion: SCOUT represents a major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems, though its performance depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels.

Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of
autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or
computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These
approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and
efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT
(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate
model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's
latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,
learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the
need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging
precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and
enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method
across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,
demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and
practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance
depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a
major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

*Wang zhi,Yuyan Liu,Liu Liu,Li Zhang,Ruixuan Lu,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SynHLMA is a framework for generating hand articulation object interaction (HAOI) sequences using language instructions, enabling grasp synthesis for articulated objects with dynamic joint variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand grasp synthesis for articulated objects requires considering both object functionality and long-term manipulation sequences along object deformation, which benefits embodied AI and VR/AR applications.

Method: Uses discrete HAOI representation for each interaction frame, trains with HAOI manipulation language model to align grasping with language descriptions, and employs joint-aware loss to handle dynamic joint variations of articulated objects.

Result: Achieves superior performance in HAOI generation, prediction, and interpolation tasks on the HAOI-lang dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods, and enables robotics grasp execution through imitation learning.

Conclusion: SynHLMA effectively synthesizes hand manipulation sequences for articulated objects using language instructions, demonstrating practical applications in robotics and VR/AR domains.

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: AmarDoctor is a multilingual voice-interactive digital health app for Bengali speakers that provides patient triage and AI-driven clinical decision support, achieving higher diagnostic precision than physicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in digital healthcare access for Bengali speakers, who are underserved compared to European demographics served by existing platforms like AdaHealth and WebMD.

Method: Uses a dual-interface system with adaptive questioning algorithm for patients and AI-powered decision support for clinicians, integrating voice interaction to overcome digital literacy barriers and supporting three Bengali dialects.

Result: Achieved top-1 diagnostic precision of 81.08% (vs physicians' 50.27%) and top specialty recommendation precision of 91.35% (vs physicians' 62.6%) when evaluated against 185 clinical vignettes.

Conclusion: AmarDoctor successfully provides comprehensive digital healthcare for Bengali speakers with superior clinical accuracy compared to human physicians, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI-driven clinical decision support for underserved populations.

Abstract: This study presents AmarDoctor, a multilingual voice-interactive digital
health app designed to provide comprehensive patient triage and AI-driven
clinical decision support for Bengali speakers, a population largely
underserved in access to digital healthcare. AmarDoctor adopts a data-driven
approach to strengthen primary care delivery and enable personalized health
management. While platforms such as AdaHealth, WebMD, Symptomate, and K-Health
have become popular in recent years, they mainly serve European demographics
and languages. AmarDoctor addresses this gap with a dual-interface system for
both patients and healthcare providers, supporting three major Bengali
dialects. At its core, the patient module uses an adaptive questioning
algorithm to assess symptoms and guide users toward the appropriate specialist.
To overcome digital literacy barriers, it integrates a voice-interactive AI
assistant that navigates users through the app services. Complementing this,
the clinician-facing interface incorporates AI-powered decision support that
enhances workflow efficiency by generating structured provisional diagnoses and
treatment recommendations. These outputs inform key services such as
e-prescriptions, video consultations, and medical record management. To
validate clinical accuracy, the system was evaluated against a gold-standard
set of 185 clinical vignettes developed by experienced physicians.
Effectiveness was further assessed by comparing AmarDoctor performance with
five independent physicians using the same vignette set. Results showed
AmarDoctor achieved a top-1 diagnostic precision of 81.08 percent (versus
physicians average of 50.27 percent) and a top specialty recommendation
precision of 91.35 percent (versus physicians average of 62.6 percent).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global AI development prioritizes performance and scale, but African markets require different architectural decisions that account for cultural context, emotional intelligence, and economic inclusion.

Method: Design science methodology with validation through a production AI-native cross-border shopping platform serving diaspora communities, using WhatsApp-based AI interaction and culturally informed prompt engineering.

Result: 89% user preference for WhatsApp-based AI over traditional interfaces (n=602), 536 WhatsApp users and 3,938 conversations in 6 weeks, 89% family-focused commerce patterns, and natural code-switching acceptance.

Conclusion: CCI framework provides theoretical innovation and reproducible implementation patterns for equitable AI deployment in resource-constrained markets, challenging Silicon Valley design orthodoxies.

Abstract: While global AI development prioritizes model performance and computational
scale, meaningful deployment in African markets requires fundamentally
different architectural decisions. This paper introduces Contextual and
Cultural Intelligence (CCI) -- a systematic framework enabling AI systems to
process cultural meaning, not just data patterns, through locally relevant,
emotionally intelligent, and economically inclusive design. Using design
science methodology, we validate CCI through a production AI-native
cross-border shopping platform serving diaspora communities. Key empirical
findings: 89% of users prefer WhatsApp-based AI interaction over traditional
web interfaces (n=602, chi-square=365.8, p<0.001), achieving 536 WhatsApp users
and 3,938 total conversations across 602 unique users in just 6 weeks, and
culturally informed prompt engineering demonstrates sophisticated understanding
of culturally contextualized queries, with 89% family-focused commerce patterns
and natural code-switching acceptance. The CCI framework operationalizes three
technical pillars: Infrastructure Intelligence (mobile-first, resilient
architectures), Cultural Intelligence (multilingual NLP with social context
awareness), and Commercial Intelligence (trust-based conversational commerce).
This work contributes both theoretical innovation and reproducible
implementation patterns, challenging Silicon Valley design orthodoxies while

TL;DR: A personality-aware multimodal framework combining eye-tracking, Big Five personality traits, and contextual cues improves emotion recognition in conversational settings, showing stimulus cues enhance perceived emotion prediction while personality traits boost felt emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate emotion recognition is critical for adaptive human-computer interaction but remains challenging in dynamic, conversation-like settings due to the inherent subjectivity of emotion.

Method: Developed neural models that integrate eye-tracking sequences, Big Five personality traits, and contextual stimulus cues from CREMA-D dataset. Collected data from 73 participants viewing speech-containing clips while providing eye-tracking signals, personality assessments, and emotion ratings.

Result: Models outperformed SVM and literature baselines. Stimulus cues strongly enhanced perceived-emotion predictions (macro F1 up to 0.77), while personality traits provided largest improvements for felt emotion recognition (macro F1 up to 0.58).

Conclusion: Combining physiological, trait-level, and contextual information effectively addresses emotion subjectivity. Distinguishing between perceived and felt responses advances multimodal affective computing toward more personalized and ecologically valid emotion-aware systems.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotions is critical for adaptive
human-computer interaction, yet remains challenging in dynamic,
conversation-like settings. This work presents a personality-aware multimodal
framework that integrates eye-tracking sequences, Big Five personality traits,
and contextual stimulus cues to predict both perceived and felt emotions.
Seventy-three participants viewed speech-containing clips from the CREMA-D
dataset while providing eye-tracking signals, personality assessments, and
emotion ratings. Our neural models captured temporal gaze dynamics and fused
them with trait and stimulus information, yielding consistent gains over SVM
and literature baselines. Results show that (i) stimulus cues strongly enhance
perceived-emotion predictions (macro F1 up to 0.77), while (ii) personality
traits provide the largest improvements for felt emotion recognition (macro F1
up to 0.58). These findings highlight the benefit of combining physiological,
trait-level, and contextual information to address the inherent subjectivity of
emotion. By distinguishing between perceived and felt responses, our approach
advances multimodal affective computing and points toward more personalized and

*Matthew Kelly*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The Epistemic Suite is a diagnostic methodology that reveals the epistemic conditions of AI outputs through 20 diagnostic lenses, creating inspectable artifacts and enabling epistemic suspension to prevent unwarranted trust in LLM-generated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate fluent but potentially misleading text that users may mistake for genuine understanding, creating a need for tools to surface the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced.

Method: A post-foundational diagnostic methodology using 20 diagnostic lenses, epistemic suspension as a circuit breaker, FACS bundle artifacts (flags, annotations, contradiction maps, suspension logs), Epistemic Triage Protocol, and Meta-Governance Layer.

Result: The methodology shifts language models into a diagnostic stance, creating an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment that preserves the distinction between performance and understanding.

Conclusion: The Epistemic Suite operates externally as scaffolding rather than embedding alignment internally, maintaining epistemic modesty while enabling accountable deliberation and preserving refusal as safeguards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent, plausible text that can mislead
users into mistaking simulated coherence for genuine understanding. This paper
introduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for
surfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and
received. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through
twenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to
reveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced
authority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:
diagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction
over foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural
requirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts
language models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable
artifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS
bundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.
A key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit
breaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based
on judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage
Protocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link
activation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and
pluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into
model architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite
operates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as
safeguards rather than failures. It preserves the distinction between
performance and understanding, enabling accountable deliberation while
maintaining epistemic modesty.

### [153] [Topic-aware Large Language Models for Summarizing the Lived Healthcare Experiences Described in Health Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24765)
*Maneesh Bilalpur,Megan Hamm,Young Ji Lee,Natasha Norman,Kathleen M. McTigue,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively identify and summarize healthcare experience topics from African American storytellers using LDA topic modeling and hierarchical summarization, with high accuracy and usefulness ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can identify underlying factors and intervention avenues in healthcare outcome gaps by analyzing unstructured narratives from African American storytellers.

Method: Used LDA topic modeling on 50 transcribed stories, then applied hierarchical summarization with an open-source LLM to generate topic summaries, which were evaluated by GPT-4 and validated by domain experts.

Result: Identified 26 relevant topics including health behaviors, medical team interactions, and caregiving. GPT-4 ratings showed topic summaries were fabrication-free, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful, with moderate to high agreement with expert assessments.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for efficiently extracting insights from unstructured narratives to identify healthcare factors and interventions, supporting clinical improvements and better health outcomes.

Abstract: Storytelling is a powerful form of communication and may provide insights
into factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes. To determine whether
Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and
avenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization
of narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed
stories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience
using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given
topic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization
approach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries
for each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were
rated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4
model, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story
summaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA
stories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from
fabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT
ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our
approach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors,
interactions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management,
among others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors
and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient
manner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling. The use of LDA and
LLMs to identify and summarize the experience of AA individuals suggests a
variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical
improvements to support patients and caregivers, thereby ultimately improving
health outcomes.

*Hyunseung Lim,Sooyohn Nam,Sungmin Na,Ji Yong Cho,June Yong Yang,Hyungyu Shin,Yoonjoo Lee,Juho Kim,Moontae Lee,Hwajung Hong*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: PANORAMA is a new dataset of 8,143 U.S. patent examination records that captures full decision trails to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in patent examination processes, showing LLMs are good at retrieval but struggle with novelty/non-obviousness assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous NLP approaches to patent examination used high-level proxies and overlooked step-by-step examiner evaluations with rationales, making it hard to measure current techniques in real patent review processes.

Method: Constructed PANORAMA dataset with full decision trails including applications, cited references, rejections, and allowances, then decomposed into sequential benchmarks that emulate patent professionals' review processes.

Result: LLMs are relatively effective at retrieving relevant prior art and pinpointing pertinent paragraphs, but struggle to assess the novelty and non-obviousness of patent claims.

Conclusion: Advancing NLP in the patent domain requires deeper understanding of real-world patent examination, and the PANORAMA dataset enables researchers to examine LLM capabilities at each step of the patent review process.

Abstract: Patent examination remains an ongoing challenge in the NLP literature even
after the advent of large language models (LLMs), as it requires an extensive
yet nuanced human judgment on whether a submitted claim meets the statutory
standards of novelty and non-obviousness against previously granted claims --
prior art -- in expert domains. Previous NLP studies have approached this
challenge as a prediction task (e.g., forecasting grant outcomes) with
high-level proxies such as similarity metrics or classifiers trained on
historical labels. However, this approach often overlooks the step-by-step
evaluations that examiners must make with profound information, including
rationales for the decisions provided in office actions documents, which also
makes it harder to measure the current state of techniques in patent review
processes. To fill this gap, we construct PANORAMA, a dataset of 8,143 U.S.
patent examination records that preserves the full decision trails, including
original applications, all cited references, Non-Final Rejections, and Notices
of Allowance. Also, PANORAMA decomposes the trails into sequential benchmarks
that emulate patent professionals' patent review processes and allow
researchers to examine large language models' capabilities at each step of
them. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs are relatively effective at
retrieving relevant prior art and pinpointing the pertinent paragraphs, they
struggle to assess the novelty and non-obviousness of patent claims. We discuss
these results and argue that advancing NLP, including LLMs, in the patent
domain requires a deeper understanding of real-world patent examination. Our
dataset is openly available at

*Zhenyu Liu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli,Zhi Ding*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Resi-VidTok is a resilient video transmission framework that uses importance-ordered tokenization for ultra-low-rate wireless video streaming, achieving robust performance under severe channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time video transmission over wireless networks is challenging under limited bandwidth and weak connectivity conditions, requiring solutions that maintain quality while being lightweight.

Method: Uses spatio-temporal tokenization with key and refinement tokens, differential temporal token coding, frame sparsification with interpolation, and channel-adaptive source-channel coding.

Result: Achieves robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios as low as 0.0004 with real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps.

Conclusion: Resi-VidTok demonstrates practical viability for energy-efficient, latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless video applications.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly
challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel
conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we
propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for
ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong
robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity
digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete,
importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens,
Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and
graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is
a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential
temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete
token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal
extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame
sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces
transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a
channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically
allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel
condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results
indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios
(CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps,
demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient,
latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

### [156] [Lost in Phonation: Voice Quality Variation as an Evaluation Dimension for Speech Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25577)
*Harm Lameris,Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish,Joakim Gustafson,Éva Székely*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper examines how speech foundation models (SFMs) respond to voice quality variations like creaky and breathy voice, introducing a new dataset and evaluation methods to test SFM sensitivity to paralinguistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech understanding benchmarks using multiple-choice formats are unreliable for capturing nuanced paralinguistic influences. Voice quality variations (creaky/breathy voice) affect human perception of affect, stance, and social meaning, but SFM sensitivity to these non-lexical features remains unexplored.

Method: Probe SFMs through open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition using a new parallel dataset with synthesized voice quality modifications (creaky and breathy voice).

Result: The work provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to non-lexical aspects of speech perception, specifically voice quality variations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel evaluation framework and dataset to systematically assess how SFMs respond to paralinguistic voice quality features, addressing a significant gap in current speech model evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct
processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual
representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially
respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.
One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,
encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation
types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and
social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely
rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to
failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic
features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through
open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether
model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce
a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,
designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work
provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular
non-lexical aspects of speech perception.

*Hasan Akgul,Mari Eplik,Javier Rojas,Aina Binti Abdullah,Pieter van der Merwe*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ZK-SenseLM is a secure wireless sensing framework that uses large-model encoders for Wi-Fi/radar/RFID data with zero-knowledge proofs to ensure inference integrity and prevent tampering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a secure and auditable wireless sensing system that can verify inference correctness while maintaining privacy and handling distribution shifts safely.

Method: Uses masked spectral pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, cross-modal alignment to policy tokens, selective-abstention head for safety, and a four-stage proving pipeline with PLONK-style proofs and micro-batched amortization.

Result: Improves macro-F1 and calibration across multiple sensing tasks, provides favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and successfully rejects tamper/replay attacks with compact proofs and fast verification.

Conclusion: ZK-SenseLM demonstrates a practical framework for verifiable wireless sensing that maintains security while supporting federated learning and personalization, achieving robust performance across diverse sensing applications.

Abstract: ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a
large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave
radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end
zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral
pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal
alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.
To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated
selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is
registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving
pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version
binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the
quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and
confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a
gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates
with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization
without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are
part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion,
respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1
and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and
rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.

TL;DR: Enconda-bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents in software environment configuration, providing process-level trajectory assessment beyond just end-to-end success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks only assess end-to-end build/test success, failing to reveal where and why agents succeed or fail during environment configuration, which requires heavy manual effort and lacks large-scale datasets.

Method: Automatically construct task instances by injecting realistic README errors, validate in Docker for scalable evaluation, and provide process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent capabilities including planning, error diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and final configuration execution.

Result: Evaluations show that while agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective corrections, limiting end-to-end performance despite process-level capabilities.

Conclusion: Enconda-bench is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving software engineering agents beyond aggregate success rates.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but
environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and
scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only
end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.
We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,
which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent
capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error
diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment
configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting
realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality
evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end
executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.
Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while
agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective
corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench
is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment

*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo is a decentralized AI inference protocol that uses swarm intelligence and pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance over traditional methods like majority voting, with strong security against Sybil attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AI faces compute limitations and diminishing returns from large training runs, requiring a horizontally scalable inference layer that can democratize access to high-quality AI.

Method: Uses swarm inference with peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models, employing pairwise ranking with Bradley-Terry-style aggregation and proof-of-capability for Sybil resistance.

Result: Achieved 85.90% on GPQA Diamond vs 68.69% for majority voting (+17.21pp improvement), with strong resilience to adversarial prompting (only 0.12% degradation vs 6.20% for baseline) across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fortytwo establishes a foundation for decentralized AI systems that democratize access to high-quality inference through collective intelligence while maintaining reliability and security.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies culture-sensitive neurons in vision-language models that show preferential sensitivity to culturally specific inputs, and demonstrates their importance for culturally diverse visual question answering through ablation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with culturally situated inputs, so understanding how they process culturally grounded information through specific neurons is important for improving their cultural competence.

Method: Used CVQA benchmark to identify culture-selective neurons, performed causal tests by deactivating flagged neurons, proposed Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS) method, and conducted layer-wise analyses across three VLMs and 25 cultural groups.

Result: Found neurons whose ablation disproportionately harms performance on questions about corresponding cultures while minimally affecting others. CAS outperformed existing methods in identifying culture-sensitive neurons, and these neurons tend to cluster in certain decoder layers.

Conclusion: The study reveals the existence and importance of culture-sensitive neurons in VLMs, providing new insights into the internal organization of multimodal representations and their cultural processing capabilities.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models exhibit low-rank structure in their logit matrices, enabling generation using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent low-dimensional structure of large language models and leverage this structure for more efficient generation.

Method: Empirical demonstration of low-rank structure in logit matrices across various models, and theoretical analysis of language models as sequential probabilistic models with approximate rank.

Result: Language models show consistent low-rank patterns, allowing response generation through linear combinations of outputs from different prompts, including nonsensical ones.

Conclusion: The low-rank structure is a universal property of language models that enables novel generation approaches and has provable learning guarantees.

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

*Wenduan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) where the recurrent core is a parametrized quantum circuit, enabling high-capacity memory in exponentially large Hilbert space with unitary dynamics and classical nonlinear control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a physically consistent quantum RNN that unifies unitary recurrence as high-capacity memory, partial observation via mid-circuit measurements, and nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization.

Method: The QRNN uses a parametrized quantum circuit as the recurrent core, with hidden state as quantum state in Hilbert space. Mid-circuit readouts are combined with input embedding and processed by classical feedforward network, which parametrizes the PQC for unitary state updates.

Result: Evaluated on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling with up to 14 qubits. Achieved competitive performance against strong classical baselines across sequence-learning tasks. Also demonstrated effective soft attention mechanism for machine translation.

Conclusion: This is the first quantum-grounded model to achieve competitive performance against classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks, demonstrating the viability of quantum recurrent architectures.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations that are faithful, shared across classes, and can be traced from any layer to logits and input visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept-based explanation methods are not always faithful to the model and make restrictive assumptions about concepts (class-specific, small spatial extent, alignment to human expectations).

Method: Develops a model with inherent concept-explanations where concepts are shared across classes and their contributions can be faithfully traced from any layer to logits and input visualizations. Also introduces C²-Score metric using foundation models to evaluate concept consistency.

Result: The proposed concepts are quantitatively more consistent than prior work, users find them more interpretable, and the model maintains competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: The approach provides more faithful and interpretable concept-based explanations while maintaining model performance, addressing limitations of existing post-hoc explanation methods.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a structured local learning framework using SVD decomposition for training DNNs, achieving BP-comparable accuracy with reduced parameters and memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of backpropagation (high memory/computation) and Direct Feedback Alignment (poor scalability, unstructured feedback) by developing a principled local learning approach.

Method: Train layers in SVD-decomposed form with composite loss (cross-entropy + subspace alignment + orthogonality regularization), using structured feedback matrices matching SVD structure.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to BP on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet while reducing trainable parameters without pruning or compression.

Conclusion: Local learning on low-rank manifolds provides a scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training with competitive performance.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic CT images from non-attenuation-corrected PET scans for attenuation correction, eliminating the need for actual CT scans and reducing radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PET attenuation correction requires CT scans, which expose patients to additional radiation, suffer from spatial misregistration issues, and require expensive equipment. There's a need for alternative methods that avoid these drawbacks.

Method: Conditional DDPMs generate synthetic CT images from non-attenuation-corrected PET images using all three orthogonal views, combined with ensemble voting to improve image quality and slice-to-slice consistency.

Result: The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 ± 10.4 HU on CT images and an average error of (1.48 ± 0.68)% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using generated pseudo-CT versus true CT attenuation maps.

Conclusion: DDPM-based approach successfully generates high-quality pseudo-CT images from PET scans, providing an effective alternative to traditional CT-based attenuation correction while reducing radiation exposure and equipment costs.

Abstract: Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential
for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue
encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution
of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching
detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal
degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to
differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to
misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed
Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon
attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to
extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial
misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment
infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an
alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation
reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can
generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in
order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from
non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble
voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and
improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans
acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method
achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an
average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when
comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated
pseudo-CT versus the true CT.

### [166] [KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25101)
*Zhuo Chen,Fei Wang,Zixuan Li,Zhao Zhang,Weiwei Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Yongjun Xu,Xiaolong Jin,Jiafeng Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is an LLM that performs autonomous agentic reasoning on knowledge bases using outcome-only supervision and multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KBQA methods use process supervision which provides weak incentives for exploration and fails to strengthen agentic reasoning capabilities.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with easy-to-hard curriculum under outcome-only supervision, starting with fine-tuning on high-quality trajectories from outcome-based rejection sampling.

Result: Consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets, achieving up to 11.1% relative improvement on GrailQA zero-shot subset while using only one-twelfth of the training data.

Conclusion: Outcome-only supervision with curriculum RL enables powerful autonomous reasoning behaviors and strong agentic capabilities in KBQA.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

### [167] [RAVR: Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25206)
*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate to improve LLM reasoning, transforming intractable problems into learnable ones by leveraging the insight that explaining "why" is easier than finding "what".


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for LLM reasoning depends on the model being able to generate high-utility reasoning paths, but for tasks beyond current competence, this is difficult and risks reinforcing suboptimal reasoning.

Method: RAVR framework uses answer-conditioned reasoning as variational surrogate for question-only reasoning, formalizing that conditioning on answers increases expected utility of sampled reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments in general and math domains show consistent improvements over strong baselines, with reduced hesitation, stronger conclusion consolidation, and promoted problem-specific strategies.

Conclusion: Answer-conditioned reasoning effectively transforms intractable reasoning problems into learnable ones, enabling RL to refine LLM reasoning even for tasks beyond current competence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

*Tianxi Wan,Jiaming Luo,Siyuan Chen,Kunyao Lan,Jianhua Chen,Haiyang Geng,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale diagnostic dialogue dataset for psychiatric comorbidity using synthetic EMRs and multi-agent framework, validated by psychiatrists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the clinical challenge of psychiatric comorbidity by creating a realistic dataset for multi-disorder screening.

Method: Integrated synthetic EMR construction (502 records) with multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation using hierarchical state machine and context tree supporting 130+ diagnostic states.

Result: Created PsyCoTalk dataset with 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues showing high structural/linguistic fidelity compared to real transcripts, validated by psychiatrists.

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk enables development of models for multi-disorder psychiatric screening in single conversations and serves as valuable resource for comorbidity research.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

### [169] [GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25320)
*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP introduces graph-based planning for LLM agents to enable parallel execution of independent sub-tasks, overcoming sequential bottlenecks in traditional approaches like ReAct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent paradigms like ReAct rely on sequential reasoning, failing to exploit parallelism among independent sub-tasks, leading to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning.

Method: Trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, using a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on graph-based planning traces from MHQA benchmark, followed by reinforcement learning with correctness-based rewards.

Result: Significantly outperforms ReAct baselines on MHQA datasets, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based planning enables adaptive parallel and serial tool execution, substantially improving both execution efficiency and task accuracy for LLM agents in complex multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is
