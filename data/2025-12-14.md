### [1] [What Kind of Reasoning (if any) is an LLM actually doing? On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10080)
*Luciano Floridi,Jessica Morley,Claudio Novelli,David Watson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs appear to perform abductive reasoning but actually just generate text based on learned patterns from human texts containing reasoning structures, lacking true understanding or verification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the nature of reasoning in token-completion LLMs, particularly their apparent similarity to human abductive reasoning, and to clarify that this is an illusion stemming from training on human-generated texts rather than genuine reasoning capabilities.

Method: Analyzes the stochastic nature of LLMs and their similarity to abductive reasoning, using examples to demonstrate how they produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding.

Result: LLMs have a dual nature: stochastic base but appear abductive in use. They can generate plausible ideas and support human thinking, but cannot identify truth or verify explanations. Their outputs require critical assessment.

Conclusion: LLMs' apparent abductive reasoning is an illusion from training on human texts. They can assist with idea generation but outputs must be critically evaluated due to lack of truth identification and verification capabilities. The article addresses objections and acknowledges limitations.

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

### [2] [Generate-Then-Validate: A Novel Question Generation Approach Using Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10110)
*Yumou Wei,John Stamper,Paulo F. Carvalho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs can generate high-quality educational questions using a "generate-then-validate" pipeline with probabilistic reasoning, performing comparably to human experts and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore small language models (SLMs) as a complement to large language models for automatic question generation in learning analytics, leveraging SLMs' strengths in a cost-effective way.

Method: A novel pipeline using SLMs' text generation and probabilistic reasoning abilities with "generate-then-validate" strategy: expansive generation of candidate questions followed by selective validation through probabilistic reasoning.

Result: Two evaluation studies (human experts and LLM) showed most judges agreed generated questions had clear answers and aligned well with learning objectives, demonstrating SLMs can produce high-quality questions.

Conclusion: SLMs can effectively generate high-quality educational questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages their specific strengths in text generation and probabilistic reasoning.

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

### [3] [Workflow is All You Need: Escaping the "Statistical Smoothing Trap" via High-Entropy Information Foraging and Adversarial Pacing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10121)
*Zhongjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepNews Framework addresses the "impossible trinity" in long-form text generation by modeling expert cognitive processes, achieving 85%+ hallucination-free rate and 25% acceptance rate in real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face an "impossible trinity" in vertical domains: they struggle to simultaneously achieve low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression due to the Statistical Smoothing Trap that overlooks expert-level information acquisition and cognitive processes.

Method: DeepNews Framework models financial journalists' cognitive processes with three modules: 1) dual-granularity retrieval with 10:1 saturated information input ratio, 2) schema-guided strategic planning using narrative schemas and Atomic Blocks, and 3) adversarial constraint prompting with techniques like Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt probabilistic smoothness.

Result: Experiments reveal a Knowledge Cliff: truthfulness collapses below 15,000 characters of retrieved context, but stabilizes above 85% Hallucination-Free Rate with 30,000+ characters. In real-world blind tests, DeepNews (on DeepSeek-V3-0324) achieved 25% acceptance rate vs. 0% for zero-shot GPT-5 generation.

Conclusion: The DeepNews Framework successfully addresses the "impossible trinity" by explicitly modeling expert cognitive processes, demonstrating that structured workflows with saturated information input can overcome LLM limitations in specialized domains like financial journalism.

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

### [4] [PARAN: Persona-Augmented Review ANswering system on Food Delivery Review Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10148)
*Moonsoo Park,Jeongseok Yun,Bohyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two-stage prompting framework infers explicit and implicit personas from short reviews to generate personalized responses using LLMs without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized review response generation is challenging when user information is limited (e.g., food delivery platforms). LLMs produce generic responses without contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness.

Method: Propose a two-stage prompting framework: 1) infer both explicit (user-stated preferences) and implicit (demographic/stylistic cues) personas from short review texts, 2) incorporate these persona attributes into response generation prompts. Adjust decoding temperature during inference to encourage diverse yet faithful generations.

Result: Evaluated on real-world dataset from Korean food delivery app, assessing impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Findings show effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing relevance and personalization of automated responses.

Conclusion: Persona-augmented prompting effectively enhances relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning, addressing the challenge of limited user information in domains like food delivery platforms.

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

### [5] [Unforgotten Safety: Preserving Safety Alignment of Large Language Models with Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10150)
*Lama Alssum,Hani Itani,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CL approaches effectively mitigate safety degradation during LLM fine-tuning, with DER performing best across tasks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment of LLMs is crucial as they become more democratized, but fine-tuning for new tasks causes safety degradation due to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Frame safety preservation as a continual learning problem; adapt and evaluate CL approaches (regularization-based, memory-based, model merging) in fine-tuning-as-a-service setup with both benign and poisoned user data.

Result: CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning; DER outperforms other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility.

Conclusion: Continual learning provides a practical solution to preserve safety during LLM fine-tuning, generalizing across multiple downstream tasks and model families.

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important with their democratization. In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility. These findings generalize across three downstream tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and three model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B), establishing CL as a practical solution to preserve safety.

### [6] [AutoMedic: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Clinical Conversational Agents with Medical Dataset Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10195)
*Gyutaek Oh,Sangjoon Park,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMedic is a multi-agent simulation framework that transforms static medical QA datasets into virtual patient profiles for automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents using the multi-faceted CARE metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLM evaluation lacks assessment of dynamic, interactive clinical conversations and comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy. The vast combinatorial space of patient states and interactions makes formal evaluation challenging.

Method: AutoMedic transforms static medical QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. It uses the CARE metric (Clinical conversational Accuracy, Efficiency/strategy, Empathy, and Robustness) for multi-faceted evaluation.

Result: The framework demonstrates validity as an automated evaluation tool for clinical conversational agents, with findings validated by human experts. It offers practical guidelines for developing LLMs in conversational medical applications.

Conclusion: AutoMedic addresses critical gaps in medical LLM evaluation by enabling automated assessment of dynamic clinical conversations through multi-agent simulation and comprehensive metrics, supporting safer and more trustworthy LLM applications in medicine.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.

### [7] [Multilingual VLM Training: Adapting an English-Trained VLM to French](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10336)
*Jules Lahmi,Alexis Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates methods for adapting English-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to non-English languages, comparing translation-based pipelines, LoRA finetuning, and two-stage finetuning strategies, finding that dataset translation quality is the main bottleneck for multilingual VLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM advancements are primarily limited to English, reducing accessibility for non-English speakers. There's a need to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages to make AI more inclusive and globally accessible.

Method: The paper explores three adaptation methods: 1) translation-based pipeline, 2) LoRA finetuning, and 3) a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. Evaluation uses translated multimodal benchmarks and manual assessments by native experts.

Result: Dataset translation emerges as the major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limitations affecting both training effectiveness and evaluation accuracy. The quality of translated datasets significantly impacts model performance across all adaptation methods.

Conclusion: Future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies rather than just model adaptation techniques, as data quality is the fundamental constraint for multilingual VLM development.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

*Zhaodong Wang,Zhenting Qi,Sherman Wong,Nathan Hu,Samuel Lin,Jun Ge,Erwin Gao,Yining Yang,Ben Maurer,Wenlin Chen,David Recordon,Yilun Du,Minlan Yu,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Confucius Code Agent (CCA) is an open-source AI software engineer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on industrial-scale software engineering tasks, built on the Confucius SDK platform with hierarchical memory, persistent note-taking, and automated agent configuration refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source coding agents lack industrial-scale capabilities, while proprietary agents lack extensibility and transparency. There's a need for AI software engineers that can handle massive repositories, maintain durable memory across sessions, and coordinate complex toolchains robustly.

Method: Built on Confucius SDK with three perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). Features include: unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory, persistent note-taking system for cross-session learning, modular extension module for tool use, and meta-agent for automated configuration synthesis/evaluation/refinement through build-test-improve loop.

Result: CCA achieves state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3% on SWE-Bench-Pro, substantially improving over prior coding agents. The system provides transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents at industrial scale.

Conclusion: Confucius SDK and CCA bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, supporting agent development and deployment at industrial scale with strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

### [9] [Sliding Window Attention Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10411)
*Yijiong Yu,Jiale Liu,Qingyun Wu,Huazheng Wang,Ji Pei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FA-pretrained LLMs can be adapted to sliding window attention (SWA) at inference time using synergistic combinations of five methods, recovering original long-context performance without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in Transformers scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention reduces this to linear complexity, but naively applying SWA to models pretrained with full attention causes severe performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch.

Method: Proposes Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA) with five practical methods: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling, (2) preserving "sink" tokens, (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers, (4) chain-of-thought (CoT), and (5) fine-tuning.

Result: SWA adaptation is feasible but non-trivial: no single method suffices, but specific synergistic combinations effectively recover original long-context performance. The paper analyzes performance-efficiency trade-offs and provides recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FA-pretrained LLMs can be successfully adapted to SWA inference through carefully designed combinations of adaptation methods, enabling efficient long-context processing without the need for full retraining from scratch.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

### [10] [Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question Answering: Mutual Information Exchange and Ranking by Contrasting Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10422)
*Youmin Ko,Sungjong Seo,Hyunjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoopRAG is a novel RAG framework where retriever and LLM cooperate through knowledge exchange and layer contrastive reranking to improve QA accuracy by addressing retrieval errors and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop QA are prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations, despite being designed to mitigate LLMs' factual inaccuracies. There's a need for better integration between retrieval and generation components.

Method: CoopRAG features cooperative interaction between retriever and LLM: (1) unroll questions into sub-questions with masked reasoning chains, (2) retrieve documents using augmented queries, (3) rerank documents via layer contrastive ranking, and (4) reconstruct reasoning chains by filling masked positions with LLM.

Result: CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets and one simple QA dataset, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and QA metrics.

Conclusion: The cooperative framework between retriever and LLM, combined with layer contrastive reranking, effectively addresses retrieval errors and hallucinations in RAG systems, leading to improved QA performance across both simple and complex question types.

Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

### [12] [Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism: A Context-Aware Framework for Detecting and Restoring "Tortured Phrases" in Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10435)
*Agniva Maiti,Prajwal Panth,Suresh Chandra Satapathy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRAP framework detects adversarial plagiarism using semantic reconstruction to recover original terminology from obfuscated scientific text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific literature faces threats from adversarial text generation tools that create "tortured phrases" to mask plagiarism. Current detection methods rely on static blocklists or general language models, which fail to detect novel obfuscations and cannot identify source documents.

Method: Two-stage architecture: (1) Statistical anomaly detection using SciBERT with token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) Source-based semantic reconstruction using FAISS for dense vector retrieval and SBERT for sentence-level alignment.

Result: Achieves 23.67% restoration accuracy on adversarial scientific text, significantly outperforming zero-shot baselines (0.00%). Shows static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in scientific jargon-heavy text.

Conclusion: SRAP enables forensic analysis by detecting adversarial plagiarism and linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.

Motivation: LLMs like Claude, Mistral, and GPT-4 excel at NLP but lack structured knowledge, leading to factual inconsistencies and reliability issues in knowledge-intensive applications.

Method: Proposes integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs using KG-BERT to enhance grounding and reasoning capabilities through structured knowledge representation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant performance gains in knowledge-intensive tasks including question answering and entity linking, improving factual reliability.

Conclusion: KG-LLM integration enables more context-aware, factually reliable next-generation language models by combining structured knowledge with language understanding capabilities.

TL;DR: A multimodal AI system combining LLMs, KG-BERT, and LSTM with attention to classify students' cognitive/affective states in real-time, improving learning and emotional well-being.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a psychologically-aware conversational agent that goes beyond traditional tutoring or affective support chatbots by integrating multiple data modalities to better understand and support students' cognitive and emotional states in educational settings.

Method: Combines Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism. Uses multimodal data including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends to classify students' engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding in real time.

Result: Pilot study with university students showed improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The integration of semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling shows promise for developing adaptive, student-centered educational interventions that support both learning performance and emotional well-being.

Abstract: This paper presents a psychologically-aware conversational agent designed to enhance both learning performance and emotional well-being in educational settings. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

### [15] [Grammaticality Judgments in Humans and Language Models: Revisiting Generative Grammar with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10453)
*Lars G. B. Johnsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs trained only on surface forms can distinguish grammatical vs ungrammatical syntactic constructions, suggesting they develop implicit structural representations similar to human syntactic knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms without explicit syntactic rules, can reproduce systematic grammaticality contrasts that traditionally serve as evidence for hierarchical syntactic structure in generative grammar.

Method: Focus on two classic syntactic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing subject boundary recognition) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). Evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts that elicit acceptability ratings for grammatical vs ungrammatical variants.

Result: LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, showing sensitivity to syntactic structure rather than just linear order. The models demonstrate structural generalizations that emerge from predictive training on surface forms.

Conclusion: Structural generalizations distinct from cognitive knowledge can emerge from surface-form training, suggesting LLMs develop functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding of grammatical rules, supporting the idea that they build implicit structural representations.

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.
  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

### [16] [XDoGE: Multilingual Data Reweighting to Enhance Language Inclusivity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10545)
*Iñaki Lacunza,José Javier Saiz,Alexander Shvets,Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre,Marta Villegas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes XDoGE, an extended multilingual domain-reweighing algorithm to optimize language distribution in LLM training, addressing performance gaps in mid- and low-resource languages by balancing data sampling across language resource levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs over-rely on high-resource languages like English, which hampers their performance in mid- and low-resource languages. There's a need to improve multilingual capabilities by addressing language distribution imbalances in training data.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Optimize language distribution using XDoGE (extended multilingual Domain-reweighing algorithm) with a small proxy model, (2) Rescale data and train full-size models with established language weights, either from scratch or via continual pre-training. Focuses on six Iberian languages across high/mid/low resource levels.

Result: Developed IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model pretrained from scratch and improved via continual pre-training with XDoGE weights. Investigated effects of data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using IberoBench framework for evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed XDoGE method effectively addresses language distribution imbalances in multilingual LLM training, resulting in improved performance for mid- and low-resource languages while maintaining capabilities in high-resource languages, as demonstrated by the released IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

*Amartya Roy,Elamparithy M,Kripabandhu Ghosh,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning; fine-tuned encoder/encoder-decoder models outperform decoder-only models for robust causal reasoning, especially at smaller scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The role and performance of in-context learning (ICL) in causal reasoning remains unclear, and there's a need to understand which model architectures are better suited for multihop conjunctive reasoning required for causal inference.

Method: Compared fine-tuned versions of encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures with zero and few-shot ICL in both natural language and non-natural language scenarios.

Result: ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often focusing on irrelevant input features. Decoder-only models are brittle to distributional shifts, while fine-tuned encoder and encoder-decoder models generalize more robustly across tests. Decoder-only architectures only match or surpass others at large scales.

Conclusion: For cost-effective, short-horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder-decoder architectures with targeted fine-tuning are preferable over decoder-only models.

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

TL;DR: RoleRMBench is the first benchmark for evaluating reward models in role-playing dialogue, revealing gaps in existing models. RoleRM, trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences, outperforms other models by 24% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models fail in subjective domains like role-playing dialogue, struggling to capture nuanced human judgments about narrative management, role consistency, and engagement.

Method: 1) Created RoleRMBench benchmark covering seven fine-grained capabilities for role-playing dialogue evaluation. 2) Proposed RoleRM reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision using multiple structuring strategies.

Result: Evaluation shows large gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, especially in narrative and stylistic dimensions. RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, with substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

Conclusion: Continuous preference representation and annotation consistency are crucial for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems. RoleRMBench establishes a foundation for improving reward modeling in role-playing and other subjective domains.

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural applications face three key constraints: lack of multilingual speech data, absence of unified multimodal architectures, and missing comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for agricultural AI systems.

Method: 1) Created scalable data synthesis pipeline for agricultural speech data (492K synthetic + 1.4K real samples across 6 languages). 2) Three-stage training: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning. 3) Developed AgriBench-Omni-2K benchmark with tri-modal tasks and multilingual slices.

Result: AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The framework addresses critical gaps in agricultural AI, promotes reproducible research, supports inclusive agricultural intelligence, and enables sustainable AI development for low-resource regions through open release of models, data, benchmarks, and code.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

*Smiljana Antonijevic Ubois*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how AI development for low-resource languages like Serbian reproduces cultural biases, proposes Data Care framework based on CARE principles to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses how large language models trained on dominant languages (like English) create biased representations of low-resource languages, using Serbian as a case study to examine structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors that shape language technology development.

Method: The research uses semi-structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners (linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers) to trace challenges in Serbian language technology development, examining historical destruction of textual heritage and contemporary issues driving reductive approaches.

Result: Identifies key challenges: superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. These issues prioritize functionality over linguistic nuance and reproduce existing power imbalances.

Conclusion: Proposes Data Care framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) to reframe bias mitigation as integral to corpus design, annotation, and governance, offering a replicable model for inclusive, sustainable, culturally-grounded language technologies.

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A comprehensive pipeline for detecting and mitigating two types of bias (representation bias and explicit stereotypes) in LLM training data, with evaluation showing successful data debiasing but inconsistent model bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulations like the European AI Act require bias mitigation in AI systems, but practical guidance for identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in training data is lacking, especially for preventing unfair model outputs.

Method: Four-component pipeline: 1) LLM-generated word lists for group label detection, 2) Demographic Representation Score for quantifying representation bias, 3) Sociolinguistically informed filtering for stereotype detection/mitigation, 4) Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation for representation bias compensation.

Result: Successfully reduces representation bias and explicit stereotypes in text datasets (validated by human evaluation). However, LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data show inconsistent improvement on bias benchmarks, revealing gaps in current evaluation methods.

Conclusion: While the proposed pipeline effectively debiases training data, the inconsistent model bias reduction highlights limitations in current bias evaluation methodologies and suggests need for more targeted data manipulation to address specific model biases.

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

TL;DR: OPV is a novel verifier that combines outcome and process verification to accurately inspect long reasoning chains in LLMs, using active learning with expert annotations to reduce annotation costs while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verifiers have limitations: outcome-based verifiers (OVs) can't inspect unreliable intermediate steps in long reasoning chains, while process-based verifiers (PVs) struggle with reliable error detection due to scarcity of high-quality annotations from expensive human labeling.

Method: Proposes Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV) that verifies rationale process from summarized outcomes of long CoTs. Uses iterative active learning with expert annotations, where most uncertain cases are annotated and used to train new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR in each iteration.

Result: Achieves SOTA results on held-out benchmark with F1 score of 83.1 vs 76.3 for Qwen3-Max-Preview. Effectively detects false positives in synthetic datasets, aligns with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, raises accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2% to 73.3% on AIME2025 as compute budget scales.

Conclusion: OPV enables both accurate and efficient verification of long reasoning chains while enabling large-scale annotation through its active learning framework, demonstrating superior performance and broad applicability across various benchmarks and model collaborations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

*Elroy Galbraith,Chadwick Sutherland,Donahue Morgan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRIDENT is a three-layer emergency dispatch system that handles Caribbean-accented speech by combining ASR, entity extraction, and distress detection to route calls to human triage protocols when ASR fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency speech recognition systems perform poorly on non-standard English varieties like Caribbean accents, creating service gaps for Caribbean populations during critical situations.

Method: Three-layer architecture: 1) Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, 2) local entity extraction via LLMs, 3) bio-acoustic distress detection. Uses transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators to support dispatchers.

Result: Theoretical framework established with psycholinguistic grounding. Key insights: low ASR confidence serves as queue prioritization signal, and entity extraction captures clinical indicators missed by paralinguistic features. Empirical validation on Caribbean calls is future work.

Conclusion: TRIDENT provides an accent-resilient emergency AI framework ensuring Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols (ESI and START), with deployment considerations for offline disaster scenarios.

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

TL;DR: Scaling English base models is more data-efficient for language adaptation than continued pretraining, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and enables better multilingual merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual models underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially for medium- and lower-resource languages at smaller scales. Need efficient strategies for adapting pretrained models to new languages.

Method: Comprehensive scaling ablations with FLOP-matched models comparing upscaling English base models vs. standard continued pretraining. Tested merging language-specific scaled models to create multilingual systems.

Result: Larger upscaled models match/surpass smaller continually pretrained models with much more data, showing scaling benefits for data efficiency. Scaling reduces catastrophic forgetting in English. Merging scaled models works better than smaller merges but still less effective than joint multilingual training.

Conclusion: Scaling is an efficient strategy for language adaptation that improves data efficiency and reduces forgetting. Merging scaled language-specific models shows promise but needs specialized merging methods for better language-level integration.

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

TL;DR: LLMs show consistent performance degradation (5-12 F1 points) when processing romanized Indian language text vs native scripts in maternal healthcare triage, potentially causing millions of excess errors despite understanding semantic intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes clinical applications in India where speakers often use romanized text instead of native scripts, but existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation with real-world data.

Method: Benchmarked leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali, comparing performance on romanized vs native script inputs in maternal and newborn healthcare triage.

Result: Consistent performance degradation for romanized messages (5-12 F1 points lower than native scripts), potentially causing nearly 2 million excess errors in triage at partner organizations. LLMs often correctly infer semantic intent but classification outputs remain brittle to orthographic noise.

Conclusion: Reveals a critical safety blind spot: LLMs that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably, highlighting the need for better handling of orthographic variations in health systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

TL;DR: The FACTS Leaderboard is a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures language models' factuality across four scenarios: multimodal image questions, parametric knowledge, search-based information seeking, and document-grounded long-form responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for holistic evaluation of language models' factuality across diverse real-world scenarios, going beyond single-dimensional benchmarks to provide robust assessment of factual accuracy.

Method: The suite aggregates performance from four sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal for image-based questions, (2) FACTS Parametric for closed-book factoid questions, (3) FACTS Search for information-seeking with search API, and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2) for document-grounded long-form responses. Automated judge models score responses, with final score as average of four components.

Result: The FACTS Leaderboard Suite provides a balanced assessment of model factuality, will be actively maintained with public/private splits, and is available at https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/google/facts.

Conclusion: The FACTS Leaderboard offers a comprehensive, robust benchmark for evaluating language model factuality across diverse scenarios, addressing the need for holistic factual accuracy assessment.

Abstract: We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

*Michael Schlee,Christoph Weisser,Timo Kivimäki,Melchizedek Mashiku,Benjamin Saefken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LabelFusion is an ensemble method that combines traditional transformer classifiers with LLMs for text classification, learning optimal fusion to balance accuracy, cost, and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage complementary strengths of traditional transformer-based classifiers (efficient, fine-tuned) and LLMs (strong reasoning, few-shot capabilities) for robust text classification while managing practical constraints like cost and latency.

Method: Concatenates embeddings from transformer backbone with LLM-derived per-class scores (from structured prompt engineering), then feeds this joint representation into a compact FusionMLP for final prediction. Provides AutoFusionClassifier for end-to-end training.

Result: Achieves 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification, demonstrating robust performance across domains with practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

Conclusion: LabelFusion effectively combines transformer classifiers and LLMs through learned fusion, delivering accurate, cost-aware predictions for multi-class and multi-label text classification tasks.

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

### [29] [Quantifying Emotional Tone in Tolkien's The Hobbit: Dialogue Sentiment Analysis with RegEx, NRC-VAD, and Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10865)
*Lilin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Computational analysis of emotional tone in Tolkien's The Hobbit reveals a generally positive, calm dialogue with increasing agency, showing how tension and comfort rhythmically alternate throughout the story.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply computational text analysis methods to uncover subtle emotional structures in literary dialogue, specifically examining how emotional tone shapes storytelling in Tolkien's The Hobbit.

Method: Extracted dialogue using regular expressions, preprocessed text, and scored emotional dimensions using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify valence (positivity), arousal (excitement), and dominance (agency).

Result: Dialogue maintains generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as story progresses. Visualizations show Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort.

Conclusion: Computational tools combined with literary interpretation can reveal emotional rhythms in literature, demonstrating how Tolkien modulates emotional tone to create a steady storytelling rhythm in The Hobbit.

Abstract: This study analyzes the emotional tone of dialogue in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit.

### [30] [Computational emotion analysis with multimodal LLMs: Current evidence on an emerging methodological opportunity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10882)
*Hauke Licht*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs show high reliability and low bias in ideal conditions for emotion analysis, but perform poorly on real-world political debates, requiring careful evaluation before use in political research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal generative AI promises advances in analyzing emotions in political communication, there's a lack of evidence about its effectiveness for emotion analysis, creating a research gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Evaluates current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) using two complementary datasets of human-labeled video recordings: one under ideal circumstances and another with real-world parliamentary debates.

Result: Under ideal conditions, mLLMs show highly reliable emotional arousal ratings with minimal demographic bias. However, in real-world parliamentary debates, their arousal ratings perform poorly, potentially affecting downstream statistical inferences.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and provides a replicable framework for such assessments, cautioning against uncritical adoption in real-world political contexts.

Abstract: Emotions are central to politics and analyzing their role in political communication has a long tradition. As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.

### [31] [Neuromorphic Eye Tracking for Low-Latency Pupil Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09969)
*Paul Hueber,Luca Peres,Florian Pitters,Alejandro Gloriani,Oliver Rhodes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a neuromorphic approach to eye tracking using spiking neural networks (SNNs) that achieves high accuracy (3.7-4.1px error) with dramatically reduced model size (20x smaller) and compute (850x less) compared to ANN alternatives, enabling low-power (3.9-4.9 mW) wearable AR/VR applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional frame-based eye tracking suffers from motion blur, high computational cost, and limited temporal resolution, making it unsuitable for low-power wearable AR/VR systems. While neuromorphic sensors and SNNs offer promise, existing approaches are either too specialized or underperform compared to modern ANN architectures.

Method: The authors create neuromorphic versions of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models by replacing recurrent and attention modules with lightweight Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) layers and using depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The SNN models achieve 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the specialized Retina system's 3.24px accuracy, while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x compared to ANN variants. The systems are projected to operate at 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz.

Conclusion: High-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be successfully redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment in AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

### [32] [ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031)
*Woojin Lee,Hyugjae Chang,Jaeho Moon,Jaehyup Lee,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABBSPO is a weakly supervised oriented object detection framework that improves scale estimation and orientation prediction using adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous HBox-supervised OOD methods have limitations in scale estimation due to directly comparing GT HBoxes with minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: Proposes two key components: 1) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS) to appropriately scale GT HBoxes for each predicted RBox, and 2) Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits aerial object symmetry for self-supervised learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing weakly supervised oriented object detection methods.

Conclusion: ABBSPO effectively addresses scale estimation and orientation prediction challenges in weakly supervised OOD, providing a robust framework that leverages existing HBox annotations while achieving high accuracy.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

### [33] [Diffusion Is Your Friend in Show, Suggest and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10038)
*Jia Cheng Hu,Roberto Cavicchioli,Alessandro Capotondi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SST combines diffusion models with autoregressive generation for image captioning, achieving SOTA on COCO without RL by using diffusion to suggest improvements to autoregressive captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models underperform autoregressive models in discrete domains like language generation. The authors want to leverage diffusion's bidirectional/refining capabilities while preserving autoregressive models' strong linguistic structure.

Method: Proposes Show, Suggest and Tell (SST) - a hybrid approach where diffusion models provide suggestions to improve autoregressive generation rather than replacing it. The diffusion model suggests refinements to the autoregressive caption generation process.

Result: Achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on COCO without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion SOTA by 1.5 and 2.5 points respectively. Shows positive correlation between suggestion quality and caption quality.

Conclusion: Combining diffusion suggestions with autoregressive generation is a promising underexplored direction that leverages strengths of both approaches for better discrete domain generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaVoxel is a joint diffusion model that learns a single diffusion process across imaging data and clinical metadata, enabling unified multimodal medical AI without task-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for medical imaging typically train separate conditional models for specific predictive tasks, requiring task-specific retraining and lacking flexibility for zero-shot inference with arbitrary input subsets.

Method: MetaVoxel uses a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata through a single diffusion process spanning all variables, capturing dependencies between modalities.

Result: A single MetaVoxel model trained on over 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans with clinical metadata from nine datasets performs image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction with performance comparable to established task-specific baselines, while supporting flexible zero-shot inference.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal diffusion modeling offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models, enabling broader clinical applicability through flexible inference without task-specific retraining.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

TL;DR: Proposes Independent Density Estimation (IDE) method for compositional generalization in vision-language models by learning connections between individual words and image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-scale vision-language models struggle with human-like compositional generalization despite success in tasks like image captioning and conditioned image generation.

Method: IDE learns connections between individual words and corresponding image features. Two implementations: 1) using fully disentangled visual representations, 2) using Variational Auto-Encoder for partially disentangled features. Also proposes entropy-based compositional inference method to combine word predictions.

Result: Models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

Conclusion: IDE approach effectively addresses compositional generalization challenges in vision-language models through independent density estimation and disentangled feature learning.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Nevertheless, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like compositional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connection between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

Motivation: The paper addresses two key challenges in rendering dynamic specular scenes: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. Existing methods struggle with high-fidelity specular rendering in complex dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic geometry/material modeling, Dynamic Environment Gaussian representation, and hybrid rendering pipeline decomposing diffuse/specular components using rasterization and ray tracing. Includes coarse-to-fine training strategy.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on dynamic scene benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

Conclusion: TraceFlow successfully addresses challenges in dynamic specular scene rendering through novel Gaussian-based representations and hybrid rendering, achieving state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity specular reflection synthesis.

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition.

Motivation: Current tracking methods focus on tracking individual objects independently without considering hierarchical relationships between objects and their parts. There's a need for tracking that preserves the structural relationships between entities in a scene.

Method: Introduces a novel task definition and creates the first benchmark dataset for hierarchical instance tracking. The dataset contains 2,765 unique entities tracked across 552 videos, belonging to 40 categories spanning both objects and parts.

Result: Evaluation of seven variants of four models adapted for the task shows the dataset is challenging, indicating current tracking methods struggle with maintaining hierarchical relationships while tracking.

TL;DR: Using topological data analysis (wavelet persistence) to improve breast cancer detection model generalization across different mammography scanners and populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening suffers from false positives/negatives and model performance degrades when deployed across different scanners, modalities, and patient populations. Need for better generalization.

Method: Propose wavelet-based vectorization of persistent homology to summarize image structure across intensity thresholds. Create stable spatial multi-scale maps integrated into two-stage detection pipeline via channel concatenation. Trained on CBIS DDSM (US film mammography), evaluated on INbreast (Portugal digital) and CMMD (China digital).

Result: On INbreast dataset, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increased patient-level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under limited training budget, showing significant improvement in cross-population generalization.

Conclusion: Wavelet persistence features from topological data analysis effectively improve breast cancer detection model generalization across different scanners and populations, addressing key deployment challenges in medical imaging.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations. These maps are integrated into a two stage detection pipeline through input level channel concatenation. The model is trained and validated on the CBIS DDSM digitized film mammography cohort from the United States and evaluated on two independent full field digital mammography cohorts from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), with performance reported at the patient level. On INbreast, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increases patient level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under a limited training budget.

TL;DR: FCTM (Feature Coding Test Model) achieves ~85% bitrate reduction for compressing DNN intermediate features, enabling efficient edge-cloud split inference while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are computationally expensive for edge devices, but full offloading to cloud causes latency, bandwidth, and privacy issues. Edge-cloud split inference needs efficient compression of intermediate features to reduce bandwidth overhead.

Method: Developed Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM) as part of MPEG's Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, creating a specialized bitstream syntax and codec pipeline for compressing intermediate neural network features.

Result: Achieved average 85.14% bitrate reduction across multiple vision tasks while maintaining model accuracy, demonstrating significant bandwidth savings for split inference.

Conclusion: FCM/FCTM provides a scalable, interoperable solution for efficient deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive edge applications through standardized feature compression.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCDrive introduces latent chain-of-thought reasoning for autonomous driving using action-aligned latent tokens instead of natural language, improving inference speed and driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language may not be the most efficient representation for chain-of-thought reasoning in autonomous driving. Text-based reasoning has limitations in capturing driving action outcomes effectively.

Method: Uses latent language with two token types: action-proposal tokens (same vocabulary as output actions) and world model tokens (learned latent world model for future outcomes). Cold-started with ground-truth future rollouts, then post-trained with closed-loop reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines on large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark.

Conclusion: Latent chain-of-thought reasoning in action-aligned space is more effective than natural language reasoning for autonomous driving, unifying reasoning and decision making while improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCM (Feature Coding for Machines) compresses neural features instead of pixels for machine-to-machine communication, reducing bandwidth while maintaining accuracy close to edge inference, with existing codecs like HEVC performing well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-to-machine systems inefficiently stream pixel-based video using human-optimized codecs, consuming excessive bandwidth, scaling poorly, and exposing raw images to third parties.

Method: FCM compresses intermediate neural features rather than pixels, using H.26X codecs as inner codecs. MPEG's VCM applies task-aware coding in pixel domain, while FCM focuses on feature compression.

Result: FCM maintains accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. HEVC and VVC achieve nearly identical machine task performance (1.39% BD-Rate increase when replacing VVC with HEVC), while AVC performs worse (32.28% increase). For tracking tasks, codec choice has minimal impact, with HEVC even outperforming VVC.

Conclusion: Existing hardware for deployed codecs (like HEVC) can support machine-to-machine communication without performance degradation, making FCM a practical solution for efficient, privacy-preserving machine vision systems.

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

### [42] [Multi-dimensional Preference Alignment by Conditioning Reward Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10237)
*Jiho Jang,Jinyoung Kim,Kyungjune Baek,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDPO addresses reward conflicts in diffusion model alignment by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective with conditional training, enabling independent optimization across multiple reward dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO formulations for aligning diffusion models have a fundamental limitation: they aggregate diverse evaluation axes (aesthetic quality, semantic alignment) into a single scalar reward using the Bradley-Terry model. This creates reward conflicts where models unlearn desirable features from specific dimensions if they appear in globally non-preferred samples.

Method: Proposes Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO) with: 1) Disentangled Bradley-Terry objective that resolves reward conflicts, 2) Explicit injection of preference outcome vectors as conditions during training, allowing independent optimization for each reward axis within a single network, 3) Dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate superior performance on benchmarks. The conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

Conclusion: MCDPO effectively addresses the reward conflict problem in diffusion model alignment by enabling disentangled optimization across multiple reward dimensions, providing both improved performance and flexible inference-time control over different quality aspects.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT enables effective semi-supervised few-shot learning by addressing VLM's flat probability distributions through classifier initialization and temperature tuning, achieving performance close to supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSFSL has neglected powerful open-source VLMs and pretraining data, while related FSL fields have successfully leveraged them. Real-world auto-annotation applications require SSFSL to effectively use these resources, but current SSL methods fail when applied to VLMs.

Method: SWIFT (Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning) uses classifier initialization and temperature tuning to address VLM's flat probability distributions. It enables SSL methods to effectively finetune VLMs using limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant noisy data from pretraining sets.

Result: SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by ~5 accuracy points on five SSFSL benchmarks. It even rivals supervised learning performance where VLMs are finetuned with ground truth labels on unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Simple techniques like classifier initialization and temperature tuning can overcome VLM limitations in SSFSL, enabling effective utilization of open-source resources for real-world auto-annotation applications.

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

TL;DR: RobustSora benchmark evaluates how digital watermarks affect AI-generated video detection, showing detectors partially rely on watermarks with 2-8pp performance variations when watermarks are manipulated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC video detection benchmarks overlook that many generative models embed digital watermarks, and detectors may rely on these patterns, creating a vulnerability in detection systems.

Method: Created RobustSora benchmark with 6,500 videos in four categories: Authentic-Clean, Authentic-Spoofed (with fake watermarks), Generated-Watermarked, and Generated-DeWatermarked. Evaluated ten models across two tasks: Task-I tests detection on watermark-removed AI videos, Task-II assesses false alarms on authentic videos with fake watermarks.

Result: Models show 2-8 percentage point performance variations under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models have consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs show diverse patterns (2-8pp), confirming partial watermark dependency in detection systems.

Conclusion: AIGC video detectors partially depend on watermarks, highlighting the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools for advancing robust AIGC detection research.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D graph convolution methods for category-level object pose estimation focus only on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. They lack global context needed for robustness against intra-class variations.

Method: THE-Pose leverages topological priors via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. It extracts consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, then adaptively integrates these with point-cloud features through a Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module that bridges 2D image context and 3D geometric structure.

Result: Extensive experiments on REAL275 dataset show THE-Pose achieves 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics. The fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects even under significant occlusions.

Conclusion: THE-Pose demonstrates that combining 2D topological features with 3D geometric features through hybrid graph fusion significantly improves category-level 6D pose estimation, overcoming limitations of pure 3D graph convolution methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardiac chamber segmentation in echocardiography is crucial for clinical diagnosis, but existing methods struggle with balancing long-range spatiotemporal dependency capture, computational efficiency, and fine-grained feature representation against imaging noise, artifacts, and heart motion challenges.

Method: GDKVM architecture with three key components: 1) Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) for modeling inter-frame correlations, 2) Gated Delta Rule (GDR) for efficient intermediate memory state storage, and 3) Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module for multi-scale local-global feature integration to handle boundary blurring and noise.

Result: GDKVM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two mainstream echocardiography datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) in segmentation accuracy and robustness while ensuring real-time performance.

Conclusion: GDKVM provides an effective solution for echocardiography video segmentation that better balances spatiotemporal dependency modeling with computational efficiency, offering improved clinical utility through enhanced accuracy and real-time capability.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-NCD is a multimodal framework that fuses visual-textual semantics with prototype-guided clustering to discover novel classes using prior knowledge from known classes, achieving significant accuracy improvements and resilience to long-tail distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCD methods rely solely on visual features which have limitations: insufficient feature discriminability and vulnerability to long-tail data distributions. There's a need for more robust approaches that can leverage multimodal information.

Method: Proposes LLM-NCD framework that fuses visual-textual semantics with prototype-guided clustering. Key innovations: 1) Joint optimization of known class image and text features to model cluster centers and semantic prototypes, 2) Dual-phase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known/novel samples using semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering.

Result: On CIFAR-100 dataset, achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes compared to current methods. Notably demonstrates unique resilience to long-tail distributions - a first in NCD literature.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion of visual-textual semantics with prototype-guided clustering significantly improves novel class discovery performance and addresses key limitations of visual-only approaches, particularly for handling long-tail distributions.

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

### [48] [Long-LRM++: Preserving Fine Details in Feed-Forward Wide-Coverage Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10267)
*Chen Ziwen,Hao Tan,Peng Wang,Zexiang Xu,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Long-LRM++ improves 3D scene reconstruction by combining implicit representation quality with explicit Gaussian splatting speed, achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering while handling 64 input views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face trade-offs: Gaussian splatting (Long-LRM) enables feed-forward reconstruction but suffers from error sensitivity and blurring, while implicit representations (LVSM, LaCT) offer high fidelity but require computationally intensive decompression that prevents real-time rendering.

Method: Long-LRM++ uses a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder, balancing the benefits of implicit representations (high fidelity) with explicit methods (speed), scaling to 64 input views at 950×540 resolution.

Result: Achieves real-time 14 FPS rendering on A100 GPU while matching LaCT's rendering quality on DL3DV, scales to 64 input views, and delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to Gaussian-based methods.

Conclusion: The semi-explicit representation with lightweight decoder successfully bridges the gap between implicit representation quality and real-time performance, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction without the computational bottlenecks of prior methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable Gaussian splatting (GS) have enabled feed-forward reconstruction of scenes from tens of input views. Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\times540$ resolution, achieving 360° scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential "decompression" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths. Additionally, Long-LRM++ delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework.

*Hongsin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stronger robust teachers don't always create more robust students due to robust saturation. The paper identifies adversarial transferability as key and proposes SAAD to reweight training examples by transferability, improving robustness over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial distillation methods often fail to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers, and stronger teachers don't necessarily yield more robust students (robust saturation phenomenon). Current explanations focusing on capacity gaps are incomplete.

Method: Proposes Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD) that reweights training examples by their measured adversarial transferability (fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against teacher) without additional computational cost.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior adversarial distillation methods.

Conclusion: Adversarial transferability is a key factor in successful robustness transfer, not just capacity gaps. SAAD effectively addresses robust saturation by adaptively reweighting examples based on transferability, providing consistent improvements across datasets.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

TL;DR: MotionEdit is a new dataset and benchmark for motion-centric image editing, focusing on realistic motion transformations while preserving identity and structure. The paper also proposes MotionNFT, a fine-tuning framework that improves motion editing quality in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing datasets focus on static appearance changes or have low-quality motion edits. There's a need for high-quality motion editing that preserves identity, structure, and physical plausibility for applications like frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.

Method: 1) Created MotionEdit dataset with high-fidelity image pairs from continuous videos. 2) Developed MotionEdit-Bench benchmark with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. 3) Proposed MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning) framework that computes motion alignment rewards to guide models toward accurate motion transformations.

Result: MotionEdit-Bench reveals motion editing remains challenging for state-of-the-art diffusion models. MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity for FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit models without sacrificing general editing ability.

Conclusion: Motion editing is a scientifically challenging and practically significant task. The MotionEdit dataset and MotionNFT framework provide effective solutions for improving motion-centric image editing in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShotDirector is a framework for controllable multi-shot video generation that integrates camera control and editing-pattern-aware prompting to achieve film-like shot transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods focus on low-level visual consistency but neglect intentional film-editing patterns and cinematographic language, resulting in mere sequential shot changes without coherent narrative expression.

Method: Proposes ShotDirector with: 1) camera control module using 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings for precise camera information injection, 2) shot-aware mask mechanism with hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, and 3) ShotWeaver40K dataset capturing film-like editing pattern priors.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in achieving film-like controllable shot transitions, with evaluation metrics developed for controllable multi-shot video generation.

Conclusion: ShotDirector successfully combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance to address the limitation of current video generation methods, enabling intentional film-editing patterns and coherent narrative expression in multi-shot video generation.

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Disentangled360 is a 3D-aware framework that combines direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° view synthesis for medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across different contexts (medical imaging vs natural scenes). There's a need for a unified framework that can handle both isotropic and anisotropic contributions while maintaining structural realism and avoiding scene-specific finetuning.

Method: The framework uses a Gaussian Splatting backbone with distinct separation of isotropic and anisotropic contributions. It implements a dual-branch conditioning framework: one for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data, and another for real-world RGB scenes using normalized camera embeddings. A hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method addresses scale ambiguity by adaptively sampling scene depth and material transitions as stable pivots during scene distillation.

Result: Evaluations on Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets show superior SSIM and LPIPS performance. Runtime assessments confirm viability for interactive applications. The framework integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a single inference pipeline.

Conclusion: Disentangled360 enables mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation without requiring scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations, offering a practical solution for photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality.

Abstract: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

*Duo Zheng,Shijia Huang,Yanyang Li,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient-VLN reduces training overhead in Vision-Language Navigation by addressing quadratic computational burden from long observation sequences and exploration-efficiency trade-offs in DAgger, achieving SOTA performance with dramatically reduced GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show promise in VLN but face severe training overhead from (1) quadratic computational burden from processing long historical observations as massive token sequences, and (2) exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger where more exploration yields better error recovery but increases trajectory lengths for training/inference.

Method: Proposes Efficient-VLN with two efficient memory mechanisms: progressive memory (dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations) and learnable recursive memory (uses key-value cache of learnable tokens as memory state). Also introduces dynamic mixed policy to balance exploration-efficiency trade-off.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Consumes only 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Efficient-VLN successfully addresses training efficiency challenges in VLN through novel memory mechanisms and policy balancing, enabling practical development of MLLMs for navigation tasks with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prototype learning framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation in histopathology that combines CONCH's morphology-aware representations, SegFormer's spatial cues, and text-guided semantic alignment to generate high-quality pseudo masks without dense annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods in histopathology rely on classification backbones that only localize discriminative regions, failing to capture full spatial extent of tissue structures. There's a need to combine complementary strengths of vision-language models (rich semantic alignment) and modern segmentation backbones (fine-grained spatial cues) under weak supervision.

Method: 1) Text-guided prototype initialization using pathology descriptions for more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. 2) Structural distillation mechanism to transfer spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and tissue boundaries. 3) Integration of CONCH's morphology-aware representations, SegFormer's multi-scale structural cues, and text-guided semantic alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms existing WSSS methods on BCSS-WSSS datasets, produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, enhances semantic consistency across tissue types, and remains computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

Conclusion: The proposed prototype learning framework successfully integrates complementary strengths of vision-language models and segmentation backbones for WSSS in histopathology, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency through frozen backbones and lightweight adapters.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human pose estimation faces challenges from complex human body geometry, self-occluding joints, and the need for large-scale real-world motion datasets.

Method: Point2Pose framework uses spatio-temporal point cloud encoder and pose feature encoder to extract joint-wise features, followed by an attention-based generative regressor. Also introduces MVPose3D dataset with IMU data, multi-view point clouds, and RGB images.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline models and demonstrates superior performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: Point2Pose effectively addresses 3D human pose estimation challenges through generative modeling and comprehensive multimodal dataset.

Abstract: We propose a novel generative approach for 3D human pose estimation. 3D human pose estimation poses several key challenges due to the complex geometry of the human body, self-occluding joints, and the requirement for large-scale real-world motion datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Point2Pose, a framework that effectively models the distribution of human poses conditioned on sequential point cloud and pose history. Specifically, we employ a spatio-temporal point cloud encoder and a pose feature encoder to extract joint-wise features, followed by an attention-based generative regressor. Additionally, we present a large-scale indoor dataset MVPose3D, which contains multiple modalities, including IMU data of non-trivial human motions, dense multi-view point clouds, and RGB images.

### [57] [EchoingPixels: Cross-Modal Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Audio-Visual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10324)
*Chao Gong,Depeng Wang,Zhipeng Wei,Ya Guo,Huijia Zhu,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingPixels is a token reduction framework for Audio-Visual LLMs that uses cross-modal interaction to dynamically reduce tokens from a joint audio-visual pool, achieving 5-20% token usage with 2-3x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV-LLMs face computational overhead from massive audio/video tokens. Existing unimodal token reduction methods can't leverage audio-visual synergies, and static per-modality budgets are suboptimal for dynamic information densities.

Method: Introduces Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2) that co-attends to joint multimodal streams and reduces tokens from a combined pool rather than fixed per-modality budgets. Uses Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to preserve temporal relationships.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of original tokens, with 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Conclusion: EchoingPixels effectively addresses the token reduction bottleneck in AV-LLMs through cross-modal interaction and dynamic budget allocation, enabling efficient audio-visual processing.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StainNet is a specialized pathology foundation model for special stains (like immunohistochemistry) that addresses limitations of existing H&E-focused models, using self-distillation SSL on 1.4M patches from 20K+ WSIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models are primarily pre-trained on H&E-stained images, but special stains (like immunohistochemistry) are frequently used in clinical practice. This limitation restricts PFMs' applicability in clinical scenarios involving special stains.

Method: StainNet uses a vision transformer (ViT) architecture with self-distillation self-supervised learning approach. It's trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropped from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs from the HISTAI database.

Result: StainNet demonstrates strong performance on slide-level liver malignancy classification and two public ROI-level datasets. It shows advantages in few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compares favorably with recently larger pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: StainNet addresses the gap in specialized foundation models for special stains, providing a valuable resource for computational pathology applications involving immunohistochemistry and other special staining techniques, with model weights publicly released.

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.

### [59] [Simple Yet Effective Selective Imputation for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10327)
*Cai Xu,Jinlong Liu,Yilin Zhang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISMVC is a selective imputation method for incomplete multi-view clustering that evaluates missing position informativeness and only imputes when sufficient support exists, integrated with a VAE for robust latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for incomplete multi-view clustering have limitations: imputation-based methods introduce noise/bias when information is insufficient, while imputation-free methods struggle under severe incompleteness due to lack of cross-view complementarity.

Method: ISMVC evaluates imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, selectively imputing only when sufficient support is available. It integrates this with a variational autoencoder with mixture-of-Gaussians prior for clustering-friendly latent representations, performing distribution-level imputation.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under realistic unbalanced missing scenarios demonstrate ISMVC outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

Conclusion: ISMVC provides a lightweight, data-driven, model-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing incomplete multi-view clustering models, offering robust performance by balancing selective imputation with uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where different views suffer from missing and unbalanced observations, pose significant challenges for clustering. Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under a more realistic and challenging unbalanced missing scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Filament segmentation is crucial for biological analysis but suffers from data shortage due to the extreme difficulty of manual annotation for dense, geometrically complex filaments like microtubules and actin filaments.

Method: Uses conditional generative framework based on Pix2Pix architecture to generate synthetic filament microscopy images from binary masks, with a novel filament-aware structural loss to improve structural similarity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, outperforming existing models trained without synthetic data.

Conclusion: The proposed generative framework successfully addresses the data shortage problem for filament segmentation by generating realistic synthetic images, enabling better training of segmentation models.

Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution faces challenges with diverse, coupled degradations where existing methods assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting generalization.

Method: Proposes HD-CLIP (Hierarchical Degradation CLIP) that decomposes low-quality images into semantic embedding and ordinal degradation embedding capturing ordered relationships. Integrated into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG).

Result: HD-CLIP significantly improves detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training.

Conclusion: HD-CLIP effectively addresses real-world super-resolution challenges by providing richer degradation guidance, suppressing hallucinations and artifacts while enhancing restoration quality through semantic and degradation-aware embeddings.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSPlan benchmark evaluates VLMs on error-prone visual sequential planning tasks, showing current VLMs struggle with error detection and correction. Proposed SGI method improves performance by 5.2% through intermediate reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Vision-Language Models have impressive reasoning capabilities but remain unexplored in visual sequential planning, especially in handling non-optimal/erroneous steps. There's a need to evaluate VLMs' ability to detect and correct errors in multi-step action sequences toward goals.

Method: Proposes CoSPlan benchmark with 4 domains (maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction, object reorganization) to assess Error Detection and Step Completion. Introduces Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI) - a training-free method that adds intermediate reasoning steps between initial and goal states to help VLMs reason about sequences.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs (Intern-VLM, Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan even with advanced reasoning techniques. SGI method yields average performance gain of 5.2% and generalizes to traditional planning tasks like Plan-Bench and VQA.

Conclusion: VLMs currently have limitations in error-prone sequential planning tasks. The proposed SGI method effectively enhances VLMs' reasoning about sequences through intermediate steps, improving performance in both corrective sequential planning and traditional planning benchmarks.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation methods rely on fixed skeletal templates, preventing generalization to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. There's a lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies with textual conditions.

Method: 1) OmniZoo dataset: 140 species, 32,979 sequences with multimodal annotations. 2) Generalized autoregressive motion generation framework with Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling fusion with textual semantics.

Result: The method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions given text prompts and target skeletons, and enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Conclusion: OmniZoo addresses core limitations in motion generation by providing both a comprehensive dataset and a flexible framework that generalizes across skeletal topologies, advancing capabilities in computer animation, robotics, and virtual environments.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches for medical imaging often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the volumetric nature of the data, limiting their ability to capture 3D context effectively.

Method: Proposes TranSamba, a hybrid architecture combining Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks. The Mamba blocks leverage state space models' linear complexity for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices, enhancing the Transformer's self-attention within slices for better object localization.

Result: TranSamba achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies while maintaining linear time complexity with input volume depth and constant memory usage for batch processing.

Conclusion: TranSamba demonstrates that hybrid Transformer-Mamba architectures can effectively capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation with efficient computational characteristics, offering a promising direction for label-efficient medical image analysis.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies.

*Tarik Reza Toha,Shao-Jung,Lu,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmCounter uses mmWave radar to count static people in dense indoor spaces by detecting ultra-low frequency signals from breathing and micro-movements, achieving accurate counting without prior knowledge of person count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mmWave radars struggle with detecting static people in dense groups due to spatial resolution limits and reliance on movement. Current breathing rate estimation methods assume known person count, which is impractical for real-world counting applications.

Method: mmCounter extracts ultra-low frequency (<1 Hz) signals from breathing and micro-scale body movements, uses novel multi-stage signal processing to differentiate these signals from noise and static objects, extracts spatial information, and maps sources to individual people.

Result: Achieves 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in new environments. Can count up to 7 people in 3 square meters with minimal spacing.

Conclusion: mmCounter successfully addresses the challenge of counting static people in dense indoor environments using mmWave radar, overcoming limitations of existing methods by focusing on ultra-low frequency physiological signals rather than movement.

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex VideoQA tasks.

Method: Proposes a comprehensive Video Toolkit with spatial and temporal tools, and a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules these tools to progressively localize key areas in videos.

Result: STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework represent an important step toward building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench.

### [67] [Visual Funnel: Resolving Contextual Blindness in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10362)
*Woojun Jung,Jaehoon Go,Mingyu Jeon,Sunjae Yoon,Junyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Funnel addresses MLLMs' contextual blindness by creating structured multi-scale crops based on attention entropy, preserving hierarchical context from fine details to global surroundings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual perception despite having reasoning capabilities. Existing crop-based methods introduce "Contextual Blindness" - a structural disconnect between high-fidelity details from crops and global context from original images, limiting performance in precision-demanding tasks.

Method: Visual Funnel: a training-free, two-step approach. 1) Contextual Anchoring: identifies region of interest in single forward pass. 2) Entropy-Scaled Portfolio: constructs hierarchical context by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers, preserving focal detail to broader surroundings.

Result: Significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Adding more unstructured crops provides limited or detrimental benefits, confirming hierarchical structure is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Conclusion: The limitation is not information quantity but structural diversity in input. Visual Funnel's hierarchical portfolio structure effectively resolves Contextual Blindness in MLLMs by preserving both fine details and global context.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

*Mingyu Jeon,Jisoo Yang,Sungjin Han,Jinkwon Hwang,Sunjae Yoon,Jonghee Kim,Junyeoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2S is a novel training-free framework for zero-shot long video moment retrieval that addresses computational inefficiency in search phases and high-cost verification in refine phases through adaptive span generation and query decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for long video moment retrieval face limitations: supervised methods have poor scalability and generalization despite high resource consumption, while zero-shot methods suffer from candidate explosion in search phases and require costly VLM verification in refine phases.

Method: P2S introduces two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Span Generator to prevent candidate explosion in the search phase, and (2) Query Decomposition to refine candidates without relying on expensive VLM verification.

Result: P2S outperforms supervised state-of-the-art methods by significant margins (e.g., +3.7% on R5@0.1 on MAD dataset) and is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos.

Conclusion: The proposed P2S framework successfully addresses the dual challenges of inefficient search and costly refinement in zero-shot long video moment retrieval, achieving superior performance without task-specific training.

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

### [69] [Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Coherent 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse and Motion-Blurred Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10369)
*Zhankuo Xu,Chaoran Feng,Yingtao Li,Jianbin Zhao,Jiashu Yang,Wangbo Yu,Li Yuan,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentGS is a novel framework that enables high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images by combining deblurring and diffusion priors to break the vicious cycle between sparse views and motion blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) requires dense, high-quality input images, but real-world applications often have sparse and motion-blurred data. These issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views lack multi-view constraints needed to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases details needed for view alignment, leading to catastrophic reconstruction failures with fragmented views and low-frequency bias.

Method: CoherentGS uses a dual-prior strategy combining two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model offering geometric priors to fill unobserved scene regions. Key techniques include a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss ensuring geometric plausibility.

Result: The method was evaluated on synthetic and real-world scenes with as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images.

Conclusion: CoherentGS successfully breaks the vicious cycle between sparse views and motion blur through its dual-prior strategy, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from challenging real-world data where traditional 3DGS methods fail catastrophically.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First joint scene flow learning framework (RaLiFlow) for 4D radar and LiDAR fusion, addressing radar noise challenges with novel fusion module and loss functions, outperforming single-modal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D radar is cheaper and more weather-robust than LiDAR, provides point-wise velocity, but lacks scene flow datasets and fusion methods with LiDAR. Radar data has noise, low resolution, and sparsity challenges.

Method: Construct Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset from public automotive data with preprocessing for radar denoising and flow label generation. Propose RaLiFlow framework with Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module that integrates radar dynamic cues into cross-attention, plus specialized loss functions to handle unreliable radar data and enhance instance-level consistency.

Result: Outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by significant margin on repurposed scene flow dataset.

Conclusion: First successful joint scene flow learning for 4D radar and LiDAR, demonstrating effective fusion through novel DBCF module and loss functions, enabling robust scene flow estimation despite radar data challenges.

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

*Alberto Rota,Elena De Momi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised deep learning pipeline for establishing precise feature correspondences in endoscopic images, using novel-view synthesis for ground-truth generation and contrastive learning to optimize embeddings for surgical scene matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spatial understanding is critical for image-guided surgery, AR integration, and 3D reconstruction in minimally invasive procedures. Surgical domains present unique challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and deformable anatomy degrade conventional computer vision techniques. While deep learning works well in natural scenes, it requires adaptation for surgical images where precise pixel-level correspondences are essential.

Method: Proposes a novel deep learning pipeline with self-supervised optimization. Uses novel-view synthesis to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, then employs these for mining triplets in a contrastive learning paradigm. Augments the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer specifically optimized to produce embeddings that enable direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding.

Result: Experimental evaluation on SCARED datasets shows the pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies with improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to related work.

Conclusion: The framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy, addressing domain-specific challenges through targeted adaptation of deep learning models.

Abstract: Accurate spatial understanding is essential for image-guided surgery, augmented reality integration and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work. The proposed framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FROW benchmark for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs and proposes optimization strategies using mosaic and open-world data to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on reasoning tasks but neglect fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical applications of Large Vision Language Models.

Method: Proposes FROW benchmark with GPT-4o evaluation, and optimization strategies including mosaic data (combined short-answer responses) and open-world data (real-world Q&A from GPT-4o).

Result: Mosaic data improves category recognition by 1%, open-world data boosts FROW accuracy by 10-20% and content accuracy by 6-12%, and fine-grained pre-training improves category recognition by up to 10%.

Conclusion: The FROW benchmark addresses the gap in fine-grained recognition evaluation for LVLMs, and proposed data optimization strategies significantly improve model performance on detailed recognition tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%. The benchmark will be available at https://github.com/pc-inno/FROW.

### [73] [Adaptive Dual-Weighted Gravitational Point Cloud Denoising Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10386)
*Ge Zhang,Chunyang Wang,Bo Xiao,Xuelian Liu,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method that achieves high accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance through octree spatial partitioning, adaptive voxel/kNN filtering, and gravitational scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR point clouds often contain noise that degrades object detection accuracy. Existing methods trade off between computational efficiency and denoising quality, failing to achieve high accuracy, edge preservation, and real-time performance simultaneously.

Method: 1) Octree spatial partitioning for parallel acceleration; 2) Adaptive voxel occupancy statistics and kNN density estimation to remove isolated/low-density noise; 3) Gravitational scoring function combining density weights with adaptive distance weights to distinguish noise from object points.

Result: Experiments on Stanford 3D Repository, CADC dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR show consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance across various noise conditions while reducing single-frame processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios, successfully addressing the trade-off between denoising quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiHateLoc: First weakly-supervised framework for temporal localization of multimodal hate speech in videos, achieving SOTA performance without frame-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses only on video-level classification of multimodal hate speech, leaving temporal localization (identifying when hateful segments occur) largely unaddressed, especially under weak supervision where only video-level labels are available.

Method: Proposes MultiHateLoc with three key components: (1) modality-aware temporal encoders with text preprocessing for feature enhancement, (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion with contrastive alignment, (3) modality-aware MIL objective for discriminative segment identification under video-level supervision.

Result: Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets show state-of-the-art performance in multimodal hate speech localization task, producing fine-grained frame-level predictions despite using only coarse video-level labels.

Conclusion: MultiHateLoc successfully addresses the challenging problem of weakly-supervised multimodal hate speech temporal localization, providing interpretable frame-level predictions and outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

TL;DR: First systematic study applying RL to text-to-3D autoregressive generation, addressing challenges through reward design, RL algorithms, new benchmarks, and hierarchical optimization, resulting in AR3D-R1 model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has been successful in 2D image generation but remains largely unexplored for 3D generation due to higher spatial complexity requiring globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures, making 3D generation sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms.

Method: Systematic study across four dimensions: (1) Reward design evaluation focusing on human preference alignment and multi-modal models, (2) RL algorithm study of GRPO variants with token-level optimization, (3) Introduction of MME-3DR benchmark for measuring implicit reasoning, (4) Proposed Hi-GRPO for hierarchical global-to-local optimization with reward ensembles.

Result: Developed AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model that excels from coarse shape to texture refinement, with code released publicly.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation and demonstrates the feasibility of applying RL techniques to enhance text-to-3D autoregressive models through systematic investigation of key dimensions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WildRoad dataset and MaGRoad model for off-road road network extraction, addressing domain gap issues in wild terrains through a path-centric approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for vectorized road extraction work well in urban settings but fail in off-road environments due to domain gap, lack of large-scale vectorized datasets, and structural weaknesses in node-centric methods that are fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) Release WildRoad - a global off-road road network dataset created with a dedicated interactive annotation tool; 2) Introduce MaGRoad - a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to robustly infer connectivity.

Result: MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. The streamlined pipeline yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability.

Conclusion: The WildRoad dataset and MaGRoad's path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in wild terrains, addressing limitations of existing methods through robust connectivity inference and efficient annotation.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial-ground localization is challenging due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR scans and overhead aerial imagery, requiring effective cross-modal alignment.

Method: Projects LiDAR scans into bird's-eye-view, aligns with aerial features using bidirectional attention, decodes likelihood maps for position/orientation, and uses contrastive learning for cross-modal embedding alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on CARLA and KITTI datasets, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy.

Conclusion: TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings through effective cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Aerial-ground localization is difficult due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead imagery. We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation. A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods lack theoretical understanding of why models degrade under domain shifts. The authors extend Neural Collapse theory to sample-level analysis and discover that performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment between feature embeddings and classifier weights during adaptation.

Method: Proposes NCTTA, which uses hybrid targets to realign feature embeddings with classifier weights. The method blends geometric proximity (based on Neural Collapse theory) with predictive confidence to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels under domain shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments show NCTTA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 14.52% improvement over Tent on ImageNet-C benchmark, demonstrating enhanced robustness to domain shifts.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical insights into TTA performance degradation through sample-wise Neural Collapse analysis and proposes an effective alignment method that combines geometric and confidence-based information to improve adaptation under domain shifts.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies. The system operates entirely on the client side, ensuring scalability and real-time performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology and highlights its applicability to remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications.

TL;DR: Proposes a unified-transform video compression framework with dual-domain temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-experts to eliminate error propagation while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learned video compression frameworks face a dilemma: separate-transform frameworks cause error propagation, while unified-transform frameworks have inferior motion estimation/compensation in shared latent domains. Need to eliminate error propagation while maintaining good temporal alignment.

Method: 1) Dual-domain progressive temporal alignment: coarse pixel-domain alignment (optical flow from single reference) + refined latent-domain alignment (Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer for long-term motion refinement). 2) Quality-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts (QCMoE): dynamically assigns experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content.

Result: Achieves competitive rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while successfully eliminating error propagation. Enables quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming.

Conclusion: Proposed framework resolves the dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation, offering a unified-transform solution with dual-domain alignment and adaptive quantization for high-quality learned video compression.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

*Khurram Ashfaq,Muhammad Tariq Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid Shape-from-Focus method combines traditional multi-scale focus volume computation with lightweight GRU-based iterative refinement for superior depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning SFF methods use heavy feature encoders and simple one-step aggregation that introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in depth maps.

Method: 1) Compute multi-scale focus volumes using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels to capture long-range directional focus variations. 2) Feed these into lightweight multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines initial depth estimate at lower resolution. 3) Use learned convex upsampling module within recurrent network to reconstruct high-resolution depth maps while preserving details.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework combining traditional focus volume computation with lightweight recurrent refinement provides an effective solution for high-quality depth estimation from focal stacks, addressing limitations of existing two-stage deep learning methods.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior FSS research focused mainly on decoders, but the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. This work addresses the encoder's poor generalization to novel classes in both standard and cross-domain FSS settings.

Method: TaP uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while preventing catastrophic forgetting. The method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing FSS pipelines with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments across COCO 20^i, Pascal 5^i, and cross-domain datasets (DeepGlobe, ISIC, Chest X-ray) show consistent performance improvements across diverse models and shot settings. Significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios demonstrate practical effectiveness, with strong performance achievable even with low-rank adaptations for computational efficiency.

Conclusion: TaP addresses a critical limitation in FSS by enhancing encoder generalization to novel classes, paving the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems. The method's simplicity, model-agnostic nature, and computational efficiency make it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes in query images using only a small annotated support set. While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

*Yuchen Feng,Zhenyu Zhang,Naibin Gu,Yilong Chen,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Shuohuan Wang,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Weiping Wang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blink is a dynamic visual token resolution framework for MLLMs that mimics human "blink-like" visual processing by selectively allocating more computation to salient regions through token super-resolution and adaptive token dropping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited visual perception compared to humans who efficiently perceive scenes by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions. The authors investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior and find they naturally attend to different regions across layers, suggesting selective computation allocation could enhance perception.

Method: Blink includes two modules: 1) saliency-guided scanning that estimates token saliency based on attention maps, and 2) dynamic token resolution that extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module, then drops extended tokens when they lose focus in subsequent layers.

Result: Extensive experiments validate Blink's effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding, demonstrating improved performance through adaptive and efficient computation allocation.

Conclusion: The human-inspired dynamic visual token resolution framework successfully balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, enhancing MLLM visual perception adaptively and efficiently.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GETok introduces spatial tokens for MLLMs to improve 2D object grounding without changing autoregressive architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with accurate 2D object grounding due to tokenization limitations in autoregressive Transformers.

Method: GETok integrates learnable spatial tokens: grid tokens for spatial anchors and offset tokens for iterative refinement of localization.

Result: Superior performance over SOTA methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: GETok enables MLLMs to perform native 2D space reasoning by embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

TL;DR: Proposes a few-shot prototypical network with ST-GCN and multi-scale temporal aggregation for skeleton-based sign language recognition, achieving 43.75% Top-1 accuracy on WLASL and strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and long-tail distribution in isolated sign language recognition, where standard classifiers overfit frequent classes and fail on rare signs due to limited training examples.

Method: Few-shot prototypical network framework with skeleton-based encoder using ST-GCN and novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture rapid and fluid motion dynamics, learning a semantic metric space for classification.

Result: Achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on WLASL test set, outperforming standard classification baseline by over 13%. Shows strong zero-shot generalization with nearly 30% accuracy on unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Prototypical training strategy effectively addresses data scarcity in sign language recognition, offering scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data through metric learning paradigm.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

TL;DR: Symmetric U-Net architecture (SymUNet) achieves state-of-the-art all-in-one image restoration by preserving degradation signals through aligned feature scales, outperforming complex methods while reducing computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration methods rely on complex architectures and elaborate degradation prompts, but well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation information that can be effectively leveraged with simpler designs.

Method: Proposes SymUNet - a symmetric U-Net architecture that aligns feature scales across encoder-decoder for streamlined cross-scale propagation, preserving intrinsic degradation signals. Also introduces SE-SymUNet variant that integrates frozen CLIP features via cross-attention for semantic enhancement.

Result: SymUNet achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. SE-SymUNet further enhances performance through semantic injection, establishing simpler and stronger foundations for all-in-one restoration.

Conclusion: Symmetric U-Net design effectively unleashes degradation cues from well-crafted feature extraction, making complex architectures unnecessary. The proposed methods provide simpler yet more effective solutions for all-in-one image restoration.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods assume clean visual conditions and fail to handle weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions.

Method: Proposes a SOD framework with specific encoder and replaceable decoder, introducing a one-hot noise indicator vector to represent weather types and a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM) that embeds weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation between encoder stages.

Result: Extensive experiments on WXSOD dataset show the proposed framework (especially NIFM-enhanced encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to vanilla encoder, with testing across varying training data scales and multiple encoder/decoder configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed weather-aware SOD framework effectively handles diverse weather conditions through noise indicator integration and maintains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders, offering practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap in remote sensing image retrieval and overcome limitations of costly domain-specific training for VLMs, while lacking benchmarks for zero-shot VLM utility evaluation.

Method: Introduce RSRT dataset with structured captions, propose TRSLLaVA - a training-free text-only retrieval method that reformulates cross-modal retrieval as text-to-text matching using VLM-generated captions in unified textual embedding space.

Result: Achieves 42.62% mean Recall on RSITMD, nearly doubling CLIP baseline (23.86%) and surpassing several supervised models, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised methods.

Conclusion: High-quality semantic representation through structured text provides powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval without training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

Conclusion: Motion patterns aligned with vision-language representations provide powerful semantic signals for autonomous video understanding. TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions with effective spatial grounding.

Abstract: We propose Track and Caption Any Motion (TCAM), a motion-centric framework for automatic video understanding that discovers and describes motion patterns without user queries. Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention. On the MeViS benchmark, TCAM achieves 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.

Motivation: Current document parsing evaluation has limitations: standard benchmarks have dataset biases leading to inconsistent model rankings, overall metrics obscure specific error patterns, and there's no reliable way to assess parsing quality in real-world scenarios.

Method: DOCR-Inspector uses VLM-as-a-Judge to analyze document images and parsed outputs, identifies errors across 28 predefined types, and employs Chain-of-Checklist reasoning for hierarchical quality assessment. Trained on DOCRcase-200K dataset.

Result: DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and leading open-source models on DOCRcaseBench (882 real-world cases). Its quality assessments effectively guide parsing refinement.

Conclusion: DOCR-Inspector provides a comprehensive, reliable assessment framework for document parsing that addresses limitations of current benchmarks, serving as both an evaluator and a driver for improving parsing systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

Conclusion: K-Track provides a practical path for deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, bridging the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

Abstract: Point tracking in video sequences is a foundational capability for real-world computer vision applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, augmented reality, and video analysis. While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have made it increasingly easy to fabricate realistic portrayals of individuals, creating serious risks for security, communication, and public trust. Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats.

Abstract: The complexity of autonomous driving scenarios requires robust models that can interpret high-level navigation commands and generate safe trajectories. While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a novel navigation compliance metric to evaluate adherence to intended route, improving controllability and navigation safety. To comprehensively assess our model's controllability, we design a test that evaluates its response to various navigation commands.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XDen-1K is the first large-scale multi-modal dataset for real-world physical property estimation, focusing on volumetric density, with 1,000 objects across 148 categories including 3D models and X-ray scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models capture surface geometry but neglect internal physical properties like volumetric density, which are crucial for predicting object behavior in robotics and simulation. The main limitation has been the lack of large-scale real-world data.

Method: 1) Created XDen-1K dataset with 1,000 real-world objects, providing high-resolution 3D models with part-level annotations and corresponding biplanar X-ray scans. 2) Developed an optimization framework to recover volumetric density fields from sparse X-ray views. 3) Used X-ray images to condition segmentation networks for volumetric segmentation.

Result: The dataset enables improved center-of-mass estimation accuracy and higher robotic manipulation success rates. It serves as a foundational resource for physically grounded visual inference.

Conclusion: XDen-1K bridges the data gap for physical property estimation and provides a challenging benchmark for future research in embodied AI and physical simulation.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.

*Javier Villena Toro,Mehdi Tarkian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo6DPose is a lightweight, training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D object pose estimation that uses geometric filtering with foundation model features for fully local, sub-second inference on commodity hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods rely on large-scale models and cloud inference, causing high latency, energy consumption, and deployment risks (connectivity, cost, data governance). These conflict with practical robotics constraints where compute is limited and on-device inference is needed.

Method: Combines foundation model visual features (DINO descriptors) with geometric filtering: computes similarity maps between template descriptors and scene patches, establishes mutual correspondences by projecting to 3D, and recovers poses via RANSAC with a weighted geometric alignment metric for ranking.

Result: Achieves 53.7 average recall at 1.08 FPS on a single commodity GPU, matching larger zero-shot baselines while requiring no training, fine-tuning, or network access. Provides sub-second inference with full local operation.

Conclusion: Geo6DPose advances practical, fully local 6D perception for robotics by trading model scale for geometric reliability, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without connectivity or cloud dependencies.

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.

TL;DR: SHOT reformulates SMLM as a set-matching problem with optimal transport loss, eliminating non-differentiable NMS layers and enabling end-to-end training for faster, more accurate super-resolution imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMLM requires non-overlapping fluorophore emissions, leading to long acquisition times that hinder live-cell imaging. Deep learning approaches use non-differentiable NMS layers that may discard true positives.

Method: Reformulates SMLM training as a set-matching problem with optimal transport loss, eliminating NMS during inference. Proposes iterative neural network integrating microscope optical system knowledge.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data at moderate and high emitter densities.

Conclusion: The set-matching formulation with optimal transport loss enables end-to-end training and improves SMLM performance, making live-cell super-resolution imaging more feasible.

Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) allows reconstructing biology-relevant structures beyond the diffraction limit by detecting and localizing individual fluorophores -- fluorescent molecules stained onto the observed specimen -- over time to reconstruct super-resolved images. Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training. Additionally, we propose an iterative neural network that integrates knowledge of the microscope's optical system inside our model. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data show that both our new loss function and architecture surpass the state of the art at moderate and high emitter densities.

TL;DR: SHARP enables photorealistic view synthesis from a single image using 3D Gaussian representations, achieving state-of-the-art results with real-time rendering and robust zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generating photorealistic novel views from a single image, which is important for applications like virtual reality, augmented reality, and 3D content creation. Existing methods often suffer from slow synthesis times or limited generalization capabilities.

Method: SHARP uses a neural network to regress parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation from a single input image in a single feedforward pass (<1 second on GPU). The 3D Gaussian representation is metric with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements, and can be rendered in real-time to produce high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views.

Result: SHARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% compared to prior best models. It also reduces synthesis time by three orders of magnitude while demonstrating robust zero-shot generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: SHARP provides an efficient and effective solution for single-image view synthesis, combining fast inference, real-time rendering, and strong generalization capabilities, making it practical for real-world applications requiring photorealistic novel view generation.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: The paper introduces uncertainty estimation methods for anatomical landmark-based segmentation in chest X-rays, proposing latent and predictive uncertainty measures, and releases a large-scale dataset with uncertainty annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, but prior work has focused on pixel-level uncertainty while landmark-based segmentation with topological guarantees remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective.

Method: Uses hybrid neural network architectures combining standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, leveraging their variational latent space to derive two complementary uncertainty measures: latent uncertainty (from learned distribution parameters) and predictive uncertainty (from multiple stochastic output predictions via latent sampling).

Result: Both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity in controlled corruption experiments, reflecting global and local degradation. The uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions compared to manual ground-truth and support out-of-distribution detection on CheXmask dataset. The authors release CheXmask-U, a dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation is a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray, with released resources including a dataset, interactive demo, and source code.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaceDrive is a spatial-aware vision-language model framework for autonomous driving that treats 3D spatial information as explicit positional encodings rather than textual tokens, enabling better spatial reasoning and trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models (VLMs) struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships, which is crucial for autonomous driving systems that interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning is fundamental but poorly handled by existing VLM-based approaches.

Method: SpaceDrive uses a universal positional encoder to convert 3D coordinates from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts into positional encodings. These 3D PEs augment 2D visual tokens and replace digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs, enabling direct trajectory coordinate regression rather than digit-by-digit generation.

Result: SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on nuScenes dataset and second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark among existing VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: Treating spatial information as explicit positional encodings rather than textual tokens significantly improves VLM-based autonomous driving systems' spatial reasoning and planning accuracy, making them more suitable for real-world physical interaction.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: VeloDepth provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Result: Assessment and refinement significantly improve text-motion alignment; interleaving steps yields consistent performance gains; IRG-MotionLLM outperforms baseline and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion benchmarks.

Conclusion: The interleaved reasoning paradigm successfully bridges motion understanding and generation, demonstrating that assessment and refinement tasks enable effective bidirectional knowledge flow and improve generation performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with R² of 64.42%, RMSE of 0.0974, and normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming baseline approaches on simulated coronary hemodynamics dataset.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis, reducing manual burden and bypassing slow CFD computations during inference.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.

### [108] [What matters for Representation Alignment: Global Information or Spatial Structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10794)
*Jaskirat Singh,Xingjian Leng,Zongze Wu,Liang Zheng,Richard Zhang,Eli Shechtman,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that spatial structure (patch token similarities) rather than global semantic performance (ImageNet accuracy) drives generation quality in representation alignment methods, and introduces simple modifications (convolution layer + spatial normalization) that improve convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate what aspect of target representations matters for generation in representation alignment methods - whether it's global semantic information (ImageNet accuracy) or spatial structure (patch token similarities). The prevalent assumption has been that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation.

Method: 1) Large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and model scales. 2) Introduced iREPA with two simple modifications: replacing MLP projection layer with convolution layer, and adding spatial normalization layer for external representations. 3) Tested across diverse vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT).

Result: Surprising finding: spatial structure, not global semantic performance, drives generation quality. iREPA (implemented in <4 lines of code) consistently improves convergence speed across all tested configurations and training variants.

Conclusion: The work challenges conventional wisdom about representation alignment and shows that spatial information transfer is crucial for generation. The simple modifications provide practical improvements and motivate revisiting the fundamental mechanisms of representation alignment for generative model training.

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

*Masum Shah Junayed,John Derek Van Vessem,Qian Wan,Gahie Nam,Sheida Nabavi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAT with IRM improves prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images by iterative patch refinement and graph-based spatial consistency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate cancer grading from WSIs is challenging due to large-scale images, heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches using random/static patch selection include redundant/non-informative regions that degrade performance.

Method: Proposes Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) with Iterative Refinement Module (IRM). IRM iteratively refines patch selection using pretrained ResNet50 for local features and foundation model for importance scoring. GLAT models tissue connectivity via graph construction (patches as nodes), enforces spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints, and refines features via learnable filtering. Convex aggregation dynamically adjusts patch importance for WSI-level representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed GLAT with IRM effectively addresses challenges in prostate cancer grading from WSIs by combining iterative patch refinement, graph-based spatial modeling, and dynamic aggregation for robust WSI-level representations.

Abstract: Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Wang Lu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEPL method improves domain generalization robustness against noisy labels by leveraging intermediate features and ensemble predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy labels exacerbate spurious feature enlargement in deep learning models during domain generalization, degrading existing algorithm performance. The paper aims to make existing methods work effectively when encountering noise.

Method: Self-Ensemble Post Learning (SEPL) with two components: 1) Feature probing training using semi-supervised algorithms to train multiple probing classifiers on intermediate features, and 2) Prediction ensemble inference using crowdsourcing approach to integrate outputs from diverse classification heads.

Result: Extensive experiments show SEPL enhances robustness of existing methods and exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Conclusion: SEPL effectively addresses noisy label challenges in domain generalization by leveraging latent feature discriminative capabilities and ensemble predictions, improving model robustness.

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGAM is a geometry-aware multi-view framework for 6D object pose estimation that directly predicts poses without explicit feature matching, using both explicit point geometry and learned geometry features, trained on a large synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 6D object pose estimation methods struggle with unseen objects and typically rely on explicit feature correspondences between query images and object models/templates, which limits generalization.

Method: A multi-view framework built on foundation model architectures that integrates object geometry through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks, using a query image and multiple template images.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen objects.

Conclusion: PoseGAM effectively addresses the challenge of 6D pose estimation for unseen objects by eliminating explicit matching and incorporating comprehensive geometry awareness through multi-view learning and large-scale synthetic data.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation, which predicts the transformation of an object relative to the camera, remains challenging for unseen objects. Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, indicating strong generalization to unseen objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWiT-4D is a novel method that converts monocular videos into high-quality 4D meshes using Diffusion Transformer priors with minimal 4D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap in converting monocular videos to animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes due to scarcity of large-scale 4D mesh datasets, limiting purely data-driven approaches.

Method: Uses Sliding-Window Transformer architecture that integrates with any DiT-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across frames while preserving single-image forward process. Includes optimization-based trajectory module for global translation recovery in static-camera videos.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency with only single short (<10s) video fine-tuning. Outperforms baselines in temporal smoothness on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, in-the-wild videos).

Conclusion: SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency and practical deployability under limited 4D supervision, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from arbitrary-length videos by leveraging powerful image-to-3D priors.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMSI-Video-Bench is a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark for evaluating video-based spatial intelligence in multimodal large language models, covering perception, planning, prediction, and cross-video reasoning through 1,106 questions grounded in diverse video sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive evaluation for spatial understanding in continuous visual input, which is crucial for them to become effective assistants in physical environments. There's no holistic benchmark to assess progress toward this goal.

Method: Created a four-level framework (Perception, Planning, Prediction, Cross-Video Reasoning) with 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 video clips from 25 existing datasets and in-house videos. Each item was carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise grounding. Also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks for targeted assessment.

Result: Evaluation of 25 strong MLLMs revealed a striking human-AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. Spatially fine-tuned models fail to generalize effectively. Error analysis shows systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. Typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly, and neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs, highlighting significant gaps in current models' spatial reasoning capabilities and providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for future research.

Abstract: Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: MiSI-Bench: A benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models on microscopic spatial intelligence tasks with 163K QA pairs and 587K images from molecular structures, showing current VLMs lag behind humans but fine-tuned models show promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' capability in microscopic spatial intelligence - perceiving and reasoning about spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is crucial for scientific discovery but currently under-evaluated.

Method: Proposed MiSI-Bench framework with 9 complementary tasks ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications, using 163K+ QA pairs and 587K+ images derived from ~4,000 molecular structures.

Result: Current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on the benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model shows substantial potential, surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks but performing poorly in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition.

Conclusion: While fine-tuned models show promise in basic spatial tasks, their poor performance in domain-specific scientific tasks indicates the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Microscopic Spatial Intelligence (MiSI), the capability to perceive and reason about the spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is fundamental to scientific discovery. To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

TL;DR: MoCapAnything is a category-agnostic motion capture system that generates BVH animations for arbitrary 3D assets from monocular video prompts, using reference-guided factorization and constraint-aware inverse kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion capture pipelines are limited to specific species or templates, creating a gap for handling arbitrary 3D assets. The authors formalize this as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap) to enable scalable, prompt-driven motion capture for any rigged asset.

Method: A reference-guided, factorized framework with three learnable modules: (1) Reference Prompt Encoder extracts joint queries from asset skeleton/mesh/images; (2) Video Feature Extractor computes visual descriptors and reconstructs coarse 4D mesh; (3) Unified Motion Decoder fuses cues for coherent trajectories, plus constraint-aware IK for asset-specific rotations.

Result: System produces high-quality skeletal animations and demonstrates meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs. Evaluated on in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos, showing effective motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Conclusion: MoCapAnything enables scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets, bridging the gap between video input and asset-specific animation through a novel category-agnostic approach with strong cross-species retargeting capabilities.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Motivation: Progress in table extraction has been difficult to demonstrate due to lack of annotated data, especially for multi-page table structure recognition and comprehensive page-level table extraction.

Method: Created PubTables-v2 dataset supporting multiple challenging table extraction tasks, then used it to evaluate domain-specialized VLMs and develop POTATR (Page-Object Table Transformer), an image-to-graph extension of Table Transformer.

Result: PubTables-v2 is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition, enabling proper evaluation of table extraction methods and demonstrating current progress through VLM evaluations.

Conclusion: PubTables-v2 addresses the data scarcity problem in table extraction research, facilitates evaluation of vision-language models, and enables development of comprehensive page-level table extraction methods like POTATR.

Abstract: Table extraction (TE) is a key challenge in visual document understanding. Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal generation of both visual and SVG representations with test-time visual guidance significantly improves SVG generation quality compared to text-only approaches.

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation. However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: FoundationMotion provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Early children's developmental trajectories set up a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models. We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks.

TL;DR: Any4D is a scalable multi-view transformer for dense 4D reconstruction that directly predicts per-pixel motion and geometry across N frames, supporting multiple input modalities and achieving significant improvements in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has limitations: either focusing on 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking, or being limited to monocular RGB videos. There's a need for a more flexible, scalable approach to 4D reconstruction that can handle various input modalities and sensors.

Method: Uses a scalable multi-view transformer architecture with modular 4D scene representation. Key innovation: separates egocentric factors (depthmaps, camera intrinsics in local coordinates) from allocentric factors (camera extrinsics, scene flow in global coordinates). Can process RGB, RGB-D, IMU egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements.

Result: Achieves superior performance: 2-3X lower error in accuracy and 15X faster compute efficiency compared to prior methods. Works across diverse setups and input modalities.

Conclusion: Any4D provides a flexible, scalable framework for dense 4D reconstruction that outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, enabling multiple downstream applications with support for various sensor modalities.

Abstract: We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications.

TL;DR: A real-time talking head method using Gaussian Splatting mapped to 3D Morphable Models with transformer-based audio-to-parameter prediction for temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-driven talking head methods have limitations: diffusion methods are slow or temporally unstable, while Gaussian Splatting approaches suffer from facial tracking inaccuracies and inconsistent mappings that cause video artifacts, limiting real-world applications.

Method: Map Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. Use transformer-based prediction of model parameters directly from audio to drive temporal consistency. Works from monocular video and independent audio speech inputs.

Result: Enables generation of real-time talking head videos with competitive quantitative and qualitative performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses temporal stability issues in real-time talking head generation by combining Gaussian Splatting with 3D Morphable Models and transformer-based audio parameter prediction, enabling practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniView is a unified diffusion model framework that generalizes across diverse 4D consistency tasks (novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video) by separately representing space, time, and view conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches to camera control in diffusion models are fragmented, focusing on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks and trained on disjoint slices of 3D/4D data. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle multiple 4D tasks.

Method: OmniView separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. This unified architecture allows the model to handle various tasks like novel view synthesis from static/dynamic/multiview inputs, temporal extrapolation, and camera-controlled video generation.

Result: Competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks: improves image quality scores by up to 33% in multiview NVS LLFF, 60% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video, 20% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reduces camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Conclusion: OmniView demonstrates strong generalizability in a single model, showing the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model that can handle multiple camera control and 4D consistency tasks within one unified framework.

Abstract: Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model. Project page is available at https://snap-research.github.io/OmniView/

TL;DR: Mull-Tokens introduces modality-agnostic latent tokens that can hold intermediate reasoning information in either image or text modalities, enabling free-form multimodal reasoning without relying on specialist tools, image generation, or handcrafted data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world reasoning requires thinking about space, time, affordances, and other concepts that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models are brittle, don't scale well, and rely on expensive tools, image generation, or handcrafted data for modality switching during reasoning.

Method: Develop Mull-Tokens - modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities. First train using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, then fine-tune without supervision using only final answers. Inspired by latent reasoning frameworks.

Result: Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks (puzzle solving, perspective-taking), Mull-Tokens outperforms baselines using text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving +3% average improvement and up to +16% on puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split.

Conclusion: Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution for abstract multimodal reasoning, addressing challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning by enabling models to think freely across modalities without expensive infrastructure or specialized data.

Abstract: Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-JEPA is a vision-language model using Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that predicts continuous text embeddings instead of generating tokens, achieving better performance with fewer parameters and supporting selective decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of autoregressive token generation in VLMs by learning in abstract representation space, focusing on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability, and reducing computational overhead.

Method: Uses Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to predict continuous embeddings of target texts rather than autoregressive token generation. Learns in abstract representation space, with lightweight text decoder invoked only when needed at inference time.

Result: Achieves stronger performance than standard token-space VLM training with 50% fewer trainable parameters. Supports selective decoding reducing decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance. Surpasses CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder on video classification/retrieval datasets, and achieves comparable performance to classical VLMs on VQA datasets with only 1.6B parameters.

Conclusion: VL-JEPA demonstrates that predicting continuous embeddings in joint embedding space is more efficient and effective than autoregressive token generation for vision-language tasks, offering better performance with fewer parameters while supporting diverse applications including generation, classification, retrieval, and VQA.

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

TL;DR: AlcheMinT introduces timestamp conditioning for subject-driven video generation, enabling precise temporal control over when subjects appear/disappear in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subject-driven video generation methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which is essential for applications like compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with novel positional encoding for temporal intervals, subject-descriptive text tokens for identity binding, and token-wise concatenation that avoids additional cross-attention modules with negligible parameter overhead.

Result: AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods while enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos for the first time.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the temporal control limitation in subject-driven video generation, opening new possibilities for applications requiring precise timing of subject appearances in generated videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring video segmentation datasets focus on static attributes and salient objects, allowing target identification from single frames, underemphasizing motion in both videos and language expressions.

Method: Introduces MeViS dataset with human-annotated motion expressions in text/audio, benchmarks 15 existing methods across 4 tasks (RVOS, AVOS, RMOT, RMEG), and proposes LMPM++ approach for improved performance.

Result: Benchmarking reveals weaknesses in existing methods for motion expression-guided video understanding; LMPM++ achieves new state-of-the-art results on RVOS/AVOS/RMOT tasks.

Conclusion: MeViS provides a platform for developing motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex scenes, addressing limitations of existing datasets that overlook motion reasoning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

TL;DR: Flex is a geometry-agnostic scene encoder that uses learnable tokens to jointly encode multi-camera driving data, achieving 2.2x faster inference while improving performance over 3D-prior-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems face computational bottlenecks when processing high-volume multi-camera data. Existing methods rely on explicit 3D inductive biases (BEV, occupancy, tri-plane representations) which may limit scalability and efficiency.

Method: Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. It's geometry-agnostic, learning compact scene representations directly from data without explicit 3D priors, and compresses visual input for downstream LLM-based policy models.

Result: On a 20,000-hour driving dataset, Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while significantly improving driving performance over state-of-the-art methods. The scene tokens also develop emergent scene decomposition capabilities without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: The work challenges the assumption that 3D priors are necessary for autonomous driving, showing that data-driven joint encoding offers a more scalable, efficient, and effective path forward for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing All-in-One Image Restoration methods fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations, limiting their effectiveness across diverse degradation scenarios.

Method: ClusIR uses two key components: 1) Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) that disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation for discriminative perception and stable routing, and 2) Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM) that leverages cluster-guided priors for adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation to refine structural and textural representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios, achieving remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations.

Conclusion: ClusIR successfully bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation through cluster-guided synergy, enabling adaptive restoration across diverse degradations with improved fidelity.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised pre-training has transformed foundation models for languages, 2D images, and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. The paper aims to address this gap by developing a method that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images.

Method: E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with explicit geometry, unlike prior methods that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis. The approach introduces a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an unsupervised manner to ensure convergence and scalability.

Result: E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models like VGGT. Its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks.

Conclusion: E-RayZer establishes a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training by learning geometrically grounded representations through explicit 3D reconstruction, eliminating shortcut solutions and demonstrating superior performance on various 3D tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded.

TL;DR: GroupDiff enables collaborative image generation by sharing attention across multiple images during diffusion model inference, achieving significant FID improvements through cross-sample attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion models generate images independently at inference, missing potential benefits from collaborative generation. The paper explores whether samples can be generated collaboratively to leverage inter-image relationships.

Method: Proposes Group Diffusion, which unlocks attention mechanisms to be shared across images rather than just within patches of a single image. This enables joint denoising of multiple images at inference time, learning both intra-image and inter-image correspondences.

Result: Shows clear scaling effect: larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Introduces qualitative measure that correlates closely with FID.

Conclusion: Cross-sample inference is an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling. GroupDiff demonstrates that collaborative generation through shared attention significantly improves diffusion model performance.

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

TL;DR: Omni-Attribute is an open-vocabulary image attribute encoder that learns disentangled, attribute-specific representations for visual concept personalization, addressing information leakage issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual concept personalization methods use holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders that entangle multiple visual factors, making it difficult to isolate single attributes and leading to information leakage and incoherent synthesis.

Method: Joint data-model design: (1) curating semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive/negative attributes to explicitly teach what to preserve/suppress, and (2) adopting a dual-objective training paradigm balancing generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement.

Result: The resulting embeddings are effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Omni-Attribute successfully addresses the disentanglement problem in visual concept personalization by learning high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations through carefully designed data curation and training objectives.

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: StereoWalker enhances robot navigation foundation models by incorporating stereo vision and mid-level vision modules (depth estimation, tracking), achieving better performance with far less training data than monocular-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current navigation foundation models rely solely on monocular vision, ignoring mid-level vision modules. This approach suffers from depth-scale ambiguity, requires massive training data, and struggles with dynamic/unstructured environments where geometric understanding is crucial.

Method: StereoWalker augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules (depth estimation and dense pixel tracking). The system uses stereo vision to resolve depth ambiguity and leverages modern mid-level vision models for geometric and motion understanding. A large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation is curated from Internet stereo videos.

Result: StereoWalker achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of training data, and surpasses SOTA with full data. Stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input, demonstrating the efficiency of incorporating mid-level vision priors.

Conclusion: Relying solely on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient for robot navigation. Incorporating stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules significantly improves performance and data efficiency, making foundation models more practical for real-world navigation tasks.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

TL;DR: SceneMaker: A decoupled 3D scene generation framework that separates de-occlusion from object generation and uses unified pose estimation with global-local attention mechanisms for better performance in open-set scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with producing high-quality geometry and accurate poses simultaneously under severe occlusion and open-set settings due to insufficient de-occlusion and pose estimation priors.

Method: 1) Decouple de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, enhanced with image datasets and collected de-occlusion data; 2) Unified pose estimation model with global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention; 3) Construct open-set 3D scene dataset for better generalization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority on both indoor and open-set scenes.

Conclusion: The decoupled framework effectively addresses occlusion and pose estimation challenges in open-set 3D scene generation, with code and datasets publicly released.

Abstract: We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes. Our codes and datasets is released at https://idea-research.github.io/SceneMaker/.

TL;DR: WorldLens is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating generative world models in embodied AI, assessing visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability across five dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative world models produce visually convincing 4D driving environments but often fail physically or behaviorally, lacking unified evaluation methods to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control.

Method: Introduces WorldLens benchmark with five evaluation aspects: Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference. Also creates WorldLens-26K dataset with human-annotated videos and scores, and develops WorldLens-Agent evaluation model distilled from human annotations for scalable, explainable scoring.

Result: No existing world model excels universally across all dimensions - models with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. The benchmark reveals trade-offs between different model capabilities.

Conclusion: WorldLens provides a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity, standardizing evaluation of future models not just by visual realism but by behavioral realism, enabling more comprehensive assessment of generative world models in embodied AI.

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

### [135] [StereoSpace: Depth-Free Synthesis of Stereo Geometry via End-to-End Diffusion in a Canonical Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10959)
*Tjark Behrens,Anton Obukhov,Bingxin Ke,Fabio Tosi,Matteo Poggi,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoSpace is a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that uses viewpoint conditioning instead of explicit depth or warping, achieving state-of-the-art results with a new evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereo generation methods rely on explicit depth estimation and warping, which can be limited by depth accuracy and struggle with disocclusions. The authors aim to create a more robust, depth-free approach that directly learns geometry through viewpoint conditioning.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based framework with viewpoint conditioning to model geometry implicitly. Employs a canonical rectified space and conditioning to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. Introduces a leakage-free evaluation protocol that excludes ground truth or proxy geometry at test time.

Result: StereoSpace outperforms methods from warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories. Achieves sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. Demonstrates superior performance on perceptual comfort (iSQoE) and geometric consistency (MEt3R) metrics.

Conclusion: Viewpoint-conditioned diffusion provides a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation that avoids limitations of explicit depth estimation while maintaining geometric consistency and perceptual quality.

Abstract: We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

*Hang Ni,Yuzhi Wang,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CUP (Cyclical Urban Planning) is a multi-agent LLM framework that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans through a closed-loop system of planning, living simulation, and judging components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban regeneration faces significant challenges in rapidly urbanizing contexts, requiring adaptive approaches to meet evolving needs. Traditional planning methods may lack the dynamism and responsiveness needed for complex urban environments.

Method: A multi-agent LLM framework with three components: (1) Planning - LLM agents generate/refine urban plans using contextual data; (2) Living - agents simulate resident behaviors and interactions; (3) Judging - evaluates plan effectiveness and provides iterative feedback for improvement in a cyclical closed-loop process.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness as a continuous and adaptive planning process, showing it can dynamically respond to urban planning needs.

Conclusion: CUP represents a new paradigm for urban planning that leverages LLMs to create a dynamic, responsive, and continuously improving approach to urban regeneration through cyclical generation, simulation, and evaluation.

Abstract: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

TL;DR: SciEx is a modular LLM framework for scientific information extraction that handles long documents, multi-modal content, and inconsistent data across publications with flexible schema adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based extraction tools struggle with scientific literature's unique challenges: long-context documents, multi-modal content, inconsistent information across publications, and rapidly changing data schemas that require frequent system re-architecture.

Method: SciEx is a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design enables flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms while supporting on-demand data extraction.

Result: The framework was evaluated on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. The findings provide practical insights into both strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

Conclusion: SciEx addresses key challenges in scientific information extraction by providing a modular framework that handles real-world complexities of scientific literature while maintaining flexibility for evolving data requirements and extraction needs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

### [138] [Parallel Decoder Transformer: Model-Internal Parallel Decoding with Speculative Invariance via Note Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10054)
*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDT introduces a parallel decoder transformer with speculative note conditioning adapters that enable parallel decoding streams to synchronize via shared latent space, achieving 77.8% precision in coverage prediction without modifying base model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs creates latency bottlenecks that scale linearly with output length. Existing parallelization methods like Skeleton-of-Thought suffer from coherence drift due to lack of cross-stream communication between parallel decoding streams.

Method: PDT uses lightweight Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC) adapters injected into a frozen pre-trained model, allowing parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared dynamic latent space. Coordination is formulated as a speculative consensus problem where streams broadcast semantic "notes" to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head.

Result: PDT achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and recovers approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights of the 20B-parameter backbone model, validated on a 50,000-step curriculum.

Conclusion: PDT establishes a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation by embedding coordination primitives directly into inference while keeping the base model frozen.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based peer review systems are vulnerable to adversarial PDF manipulation attacks that can flip "Reject" decisions to "Accept" using domain-specific obfuscation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the robustness of LLM-powered peer review systems against adversarial attacks, as both individual reviewers and institutions increasingly use LLMs for assessment, creating potential vulnerabilities in the scientific evaluation process.

Method: The researchers curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to manipulate PDFs. They developed WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score) as an evaluation metric and tested attacks across 13 language models including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek.

Result: Results show that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores and achieve alarming decision flip rates, demonstrating that even large-scale models are vulnerable to adversarial PDF manipulation in peer review contexts.

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge systems in scientific peer review are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can flip decisions, highlighting significant security concerns. The researchers will release their dataset and injection framework to enable further research on this critical issue.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

### [140] [Remember Me, Refine Me: A Dynamic Procedural Memory Framework for Experience-Driven Agent Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10696)
*Zouying Cao,Jiaji Deng,Li Yu,Weikang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReMe is a framework for LLM agent memory that moves beyond static archives to enable dynamic experience-driven evolution through distillation, adaptive reuse, and utility-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent memory frameworks suffer from "passive accumulation" - treating memory as static, append-only archives that don't bridge the gap between storage and dynamic reasoning needed for effective lifelong learning.

Method: ReMe introduces three mechanisms: 1) multi-faceted distillation (extracting success patterns, failure triggers, comparative insights), 2) context-adaptive reuse (tailoring historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing), and 3) utility-based refinement (autonomously adding valid memories and pruning outdated ones).

Result: ReMe establishes SOTA on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld benchmarks. Qwen3-8B with ReMe outperforms larger Qwen3-14B without memory, showing a memory-scaling effect where self-evolving memory provides computation-efficient lifelong learning.

Conclusion: ReMe demonstrates that dynamic, self-evolving memory systems enable LLM agents to achieve better performance with smaller models, offering an efficient pathway for lifelong learning through experience-driven evolution.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

### [141] [Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787)
*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAL-RAG is a training-free controller that uses a "replace, don't expand" strategy to combat context dilution in multi-hop RAG systems by actively swapping out distractors for gap-closing evidence under fixed retrieval depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail on multi-hop queries when initial retrieval misses bridge facts. Prior corrective approaches (Self-RAG, CRAG, Adaptive-k) add more context or prune existing lists, but this leads to context dilution where distractors crowd out relevant information.

Method: SEAL-RAG executes a Search→Extract→Assess→Loop cycle: performs entity-anchored extraction to build a live gap specification (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses entity-first ranking to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence under fixed retrieval depth k.

Result: On HotpotQA (k=3): +3-13 pp improvement in answer correctness and +12-18 pp improvement in evidence precision over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA (k=5): +8.0 pp accuracy improvement over Adaptive-k and maintains 96% evidence precision compared to 22% for CRAG. Results are statistically significant (p<0.001).

Conclusion: SEAL-RAG's fixed-k replacement strategy yields predictable cost profile while ensuring top-k slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth, effectively combating context dilution in multi-hop RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

*Moein Heidari,Mohammad Amin Roohi,Armin Khosravi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Echo-CoPilot is a multi-view, multi-task AI agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate specialized echocardiography tools for comprehensive cardiac assessment, outperforming existing models on clinical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography interpretation is complex and manual, requiring integration of multiple views and tasks. Current AI models operate in isolation on single tasks, lacking unified clinical assessment capabilities.

Method: Uses a large language model in a ReAct-style loop to decompose clinician queries, invoke specialized tools for view recognition, segmentation, measurement, disease prediction, and report synthesis, integrating outputs into guideline-aware answers.

Result: Achieves 50.8% accuracy on MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, outperforming general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Demonstrates ability to resolve challenging borderline cases using quantitative measurements and physiologic context.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot provides a unified, clinically coherent approach to echocardiography analysis by orchestrating specialized tools through language model reasoning, showing promise for enhancing clinical decision-making in borderline cases.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL optimization with clinically grounded rewards improves CXR VLM performance on report generation and visual grounding, while explicit thinking doesn't provide additional gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. The authors want to investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) with task-specific feedback and explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") can improve Chest X-ray interpretation.

Method: 1) Large-scale SFT on CXR data to build RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, 2) Cold-start SFT stage to equip model with basic thinking ability, 3) Apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded rewards for report generation and visual grounding, 4) Run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants with/without thinking.

Result: RL provides additional gains on both report generation and visual grounding tasks beyond strong SFT. Explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.

Conclusion: Clinically aligned RL is a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs, providing performance improvements for CXR interpretation tasks. While strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL optimization with task-specific rewards offers meaningful gains without requiring explicit thinking mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

TL;DR: Agile Deliberation: A human-in-the-loop framework for evolving visual concept classification through iterative refinement and borderline case exposure, outperforming automated and manual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-in-the-loop approaches assume users have clear, stable concept understanding, but in reality (especially in content moderation), users often start with vague ideas that need iterative refinement through "concept deliberation."

Method: Operationalizes real content moderators' deliberation strategies into Agile Deliberation framework with two stages: (1) concept scoping - decomposing initial concept into structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration - surfacing semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to align classifier with evolving intent.

Result: Achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and >3% higher than manual deliberation, with participants reporting clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort. Evaluation through 18 user sessions (1.5h each) rather than standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Agile Deliberation effectively supports evolving and subjective visual concepts through structured human-in-the-loop refinement, outperforming existing approaches while reducing cognitive load and improving concept clarity.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

Abstract: A recent watermarking scheme for language models achieves distortion-free embedding and robustness to edit-distance attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreaking attacks assume knowledge of deployed defenses, limiting effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms in T2I models.

Method: Two modules: 1) LLM-based multi-agent generation (MLAG) with metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation; 2) Adversarial prompt optimization (APO) using surrogate model prediction and adaptive acquisition strategy.

Result: Outperforms six baseline methods on T2I models with various defense mechanisms, achieving stronger attack performance with fewer queries.

Conclusion: MJA effectively bypasses diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge, demonstrating critical safety vulnerabilities in T2I models and providing a more efficient attack method.

Abstract: Text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attacks have shown that adversarial prompts can effectively bypass these mechanisms and induce T2I models to produce sensitive content, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing attack methods implicitly assume that the attacker knows the type of deployed defenses, which limits their effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to effectively and efficiently attack diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of their type by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms demonstrate that MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.

*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Zhenqian Zhu,Yamin Hu,Yiya Xi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAMBO is a Bayesian optimization framework that automatically constructs Pareto sets for LLMs by partitioning models into optimal blocks, balancing capability-efficiency trade-offs more effectively than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM merging techniques are inadequate for constructing Pareto sets: model-level methods produce sparse suboptimal solutions, while layer-wise approaches suffer from dimensionality issues that make the search space computationally intractable.

Method: BAMBO introduces Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning, formulated as a 1D clustering problem using dynamic programming to balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution. This reduces dimensionality while preserving granularity. The framework operates in an evolutionary loop driven by q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function.

Result: Experiments show BAMBO discovers superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontiers than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

Conclusion: BAMBO effectively resolves the dichotomy between coarse-grained and fine-grained merging approaches, making Pareto set construction tractable for LLMs while maintaining solution quality and coverage.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

### [148] [CIEGAD: Cluster-Conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative Framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-Aligned Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10178)
*Keito Inoshita,Xiaokang Zhou,Akira Kawai,Katsutoshi Yada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIEGAD is a data augmentation framework using LLMs to generate synthetic data for uncovered semantic regions, addressing data scarcity and class imbalance through domain-aligned, geometry-aware generation with quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deep learning faces data scarcity and label imbalance, creating semantically uncovered regions in data distributions that cause misclassification near boundaries and unstable model behavior. Existing LLM-based augmentation lacks integrated directional control, domain alignment, and quality assurance.

Method: CIEGAD uses cluster conditioning to build domain profiles, hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation for generation planning, interpolative/extrapolative synthesis for directional control, and geometry-constrained filtering with LLM-as-a-Judge for quality control.

Result: Experiments show CIEGAD effectively extends real-world data distribution peripheries while maintaining high alignment and semantic diversity. It consistently improves F1 and recall in long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks.

Conclusion: CIEGAD provides a practical data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving real-world data alignment, achieving harmony between distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

TL;DR: Enables LLMs to think, listen, and generate outputs simultaneously using rotary embeddings, reducing response delays by 6-11x for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs must think sequentially before responding, making them unsuitable for real-time interactive applications like voice assistants that require simultaneous listening, thinking, and responding like humans do.

Method: Uses properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs designed for sequential interactions to operate asynchronously - thinking while listening and generating outputs simultaneously, without additional training.

Result: Reduces time to first non-thinking token from minutes to ≤5 seconds, decreases overall real-time delays by 6-11x across math, commonsense, and safety reasoning tasks while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that LLMs can be adapted for real-time interactive applications through asynchronous reasoning using existing rotary embedding properties, enabling human-like simultaneous thinking and responding.

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

*Mingzhi Chen,Taiming Lu,Jiachen Zhu,Mingjie Sun,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Derf (erf-based activation) outperforms normalization layers and DyT across multiple domains through improved generalization, making it a practical normalization-free alternative for Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find point-wise functions that can surpass Dynamic Tanh (DyT) and normalization layers, which have been considered indispensable but may have alternatives with better performance.

Method: First studied intrinsic properties of point-wise functions on training and performance, then conducted large-scale search for better function designs, identifying Derf(x) = erf(αx + s) as optimal.

Result: Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across vision (image recognition/generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling domains, with gains primarily from improved generalization rather than fitting capacity.

Conclusion: Derf's simplicity and strong performance make it a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures, demonstrating that effective alternatives to traditional normalization layers exist.

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: FedDG method improves federated domain generalization with latent space inversion for privacy and important weight aggregation for non-i.i.d. clients, achieving better results with less communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedDG methods improve generalization but compromise privacy by sharing client data statistics. Need to address both privacy concerns and aggregation challenges with non-i.i.d. clients.

Method: 1) Latent space inversion technique to enforce domain invariance across local models while preserving privacy. 2) Important weight aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence local model predictions during aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses privacy concerns in FedDG while handling non-i.i.d. client distributions through novel training and aggregation techniques.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

*Sai Bharath Chandra Gutha,Ricardo Vinuesa,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes VML-MAP, a new method using variational mode-seeking loss to guide diffusion models toward maximum a posteriori estimates for solving inverse problems without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving inverse problems with pre-trained diffusion models rely on approximations and are computationally expensive. There's a need for more efficient and theoretically grounded approaches.

Method: Introduces variational mode-seeking loss (VML) derived from minimizing KL divergence between diffusion posterior and measurement posterior. For linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived without approximations. VML-MAP algorithm minimizes VML during each reverse diffusion step.

Result: VML-MAP outperforms existing methods in both performance and computational time across diverse image-restoration tasks on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: VML-MAP provides an effective, theoretically grounded approach for solving inverse problems with diffusion models, offering better performance and efficiency than existing methods.

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: CB-SAE improves sparse autoencoder interpretability and steerability by pruning low-utility neurons and adding concept bottlenecks aligned to user-defined concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have limitations: many neurons have low interpretability/steerability, and user-desired concepts are often missing due to unsupervised learning, limiting practical utility for mechanistic interpretability and model steering.

Method: Propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments latent space with lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to user-defined concept set.

Result: CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: CB-SAE addresses key limitations of SAEs, making them more practical for downstream applications in interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

TL;DR: Binary encoding enables neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond training bounds using Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks typically struggle with extrapolation beyond training data, especially for periodic functions. The paper aims to address this limitation by exploring how input encoding affects extrapolation capabilities.

Method: Introduces Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) for encoding continuous numerical values. Uses vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) with this encoding to learn and extrapolate periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form.

Result: MLPs with NB2E successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals beyond training bounds. Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling networks to learn signal structure independently of position.

Conclusion: Binary encoding through NB2E provides a simple yet effective method for neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions, overcoming traditional limitations in out-of-distribution generalization for periodic patterns.

Abstract: We report the discovery that binary encoding allows neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond their training bounds. We introduce Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) as a method for encoding continuous numerical values and demonstrate that, using this input encoding, vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form. Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.

*Yiyang Lu,Qiao Sun,Xianbang Wang,Zhicheng Jiang,Hanhong Zhao,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiFlow introduces a bidirectional normalizing flow framework that learns a reverse model to approximate the noise-to-data inverse mapping, eliminating the need for exact analytic inverses, which improves generation quality and accelerates sampling by up to 100x compared to causal decoding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard normalizing flows require exact analytic inverses for the forward process, which constrains architecture design. Recent Transformer-based autoregressive flows (TARFlow) have shown promise but suffer from causal decoding bottlenecks. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by removing the requirement for exact analytic inverses.

Method: BiFlow learns a separate reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping instead of requiring exact analytic inversion. This enables more flexible loss functions and architectures by decoupling the forward and reverse processes.

Result: On ImageNet, BiFlow improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude (100x) compared to causal decoding counterparts. It achieves state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance with single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods.

Conclusion: BiFlow successfully removes the constraint of exact analytic inverses in normalizing flows, enabling more flexible architectures and significant speed improvements. The work demonstrates the continued potential of the normalizing flow paradigm and encourages further research in this direction.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern media consumption has become increasingly solitary despite social presence being central to enjoying content together. The researchers aim to recreate shared viewing experiences using AI systems to address this growing isolation in media consumption.

Method: CompanionCast framework orchestrates multiple role-specialized AI agents that respond to video content using multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, and spatial audio. It includes an LLM-as-a-Judge module that iteratively scores and refines conversations across five dimensions: relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, and personality consistency.

Result: A pilot study with soccer fans in sports viewing (a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions) suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a generalizable framework for multi-agent conversations around video content, a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing. Future directions include applying this approach to entertainment, education, and collaborative watching experiences.

Abstract: Social presence is central to the enjoyment of watching content together, yet modern media consumption is increasingly solitary. We investigate whether multi-agent conversational AI systems can recreate the dynamics of shared viewing experiences across diverse content types.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: BRACE is a new benchmark for evaluating reference-free audio caption quality, testing both CLAPScore-based metrics and Large Audio Language Models, revealing significant limitations in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-free audio caption evaluation lacks systematic validation, especially for widely used CLAPScore. There's a need for robust benchmarks to assess audio caption alignment quality and modality alignment in Large Audio Language Models.

Method: Created BRACE benchmark with two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main for fine-grained caption comparison and BRACE-Hallucination for detecting subtle hallucinations. Datasets constructed through high-quality filtering, LLM-based corruption, and human annotation.

Result: Best CLAP-based ACEM achieves only 70.01 F1-score on BRACE-Main, while best LALM reaches just 63.19, revealing significant limitations in current audio caption evaluation methods.

Conclusion: BRACE benchmark exposes weaknesses in current CLAP models and LALMs for audio caption evaluation, providing valuable insights for future research directions in audio understanding and caption quality assessment.

Abstract: Automatic audio captioning is essential for audio understanding, enabling applications such as accessibility and content indexing. However, evaluating the quality of audio captions remains a major challenge, especially in reference-free settings where high-quality ground-truth captions are unavailable. While CLAPScore is currently the most widely used reference-free Audio Caption Evaluation Metric(ACEM), its robustness under diverse conditions has not been systematically validated.
  To address this gap, we introduce BRACE, a new benchmark designed to evaluate audio caption alignment quality in a reference-free setting. BRACE is primarily designed for assessing ACEMs, and can also be extended to measure the modality alignment abilities of Large Audio Language Model(LALM). BRACE consists of two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main for fine-grained caption comparison and BRACE-Hallucination for detecting subtle hallucinated content. We construct these datasets through high-quality filtering, LLM-based corruption, and human annotation.
  Given the widespread adoption of CLAPScore as a reference-free ACEM and the increasing application of LALMs in audio-language tasks, we evaluate both approaches using the BRACE benchmark, testing CLAPScore across various CLAP model variants and assessing multiple LALMs.
  Notably, even the best-performing CLAP-based ACEM achieves only a 70.01 F1-score on the BRACE-Main benchmark, while the best LALM reaches just 63.19.
  By revealing the limitations of CLAP models and LALMs, our BRACE benchmark offers valuable insights into the direction of future research.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.

Motivation: Current use of video models in robotics is limited to in-distribution evaluations, but there's potential to use them for the full spectrum of policy evaluation including OOD generalization and safety testing.

Method: Developed a generative evaluation system based on Veo video foundation model, optimized for robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic scene variations.

Result: The system preserves base video model capabilities to accurately simulate edited scenes with novel objects, backgrounds, and distractors, enabling accurate prediction of policy performance in both nominal and OOD conditions, and identifying safety violations.

Conclusion: Video foundation models can effectively serve as comprehensive evaluation tools for robot policies across the entire spectrum of use cases, validated through extensive real-world testing of multiple policies and tasks.

Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.
