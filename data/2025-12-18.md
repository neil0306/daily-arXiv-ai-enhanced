### [1] [Incentives or Ontology? A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14801)
*Richard Ackermann,Simeon Emanuilov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hallucination in LLMs is not a behavioral artifact from misaligned incentives but an architectural inevitability of transformers, requiring external truth-validation systems rather than optimization fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge OpenAI's view that hallucinations result from misaligned evaluation incentives and reward structures, arguing instead that hallucination is a fundamental architectural limitation of transformer models.

Method: Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle that provides external truth-validation and abstention modules.

Result: Hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains.

Conclusion: Hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures, and reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.

Abstract: OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.
  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.
  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T5Gemma 2 is a lightweight open encoder-decoder model with multilingual, multimodal, and long-context capabilities, adapted from Gemma 3 decoder-only models using UL2 adaptation with efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the T5Gemma adaptation approach from text-only to multimodal capabilities while maintaining efficiency, and to demonstrate the advantages of encoder-decoder architectures for long-context modeling.

Method: Adapts pretrained Gemma 3 decoder-only models into encoder-decoder architecture using UL2 adaptation recipe. Introduces two efficiency improvements: tied word embeddings (shared across encoder/decoder) and merged attention (unifying decoder self- and cross-attention into single module).

Result: Shows generality of adaptation strategy across architectures and modalities, demonstrates encoder-decoder strength on long-context modeling. Achieves comparable/better pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training performance compared to Gemma 3 counterparts. Releases pretrained models (270M-270M, 1B-1B, 4B-4B).

Conclusion: T5Gemma 2 successfully extends the T5Gemma adaptation approach to multimodal domains while improving efficiency, validating the encoder-decoder architecture's advantages for long-context tasks and providing open models for community research.

Abstract: We introduce T5Gemma 2, the next generation of the T5Gemma family of lightweight open encoder-decoder models, featuring strong multilingual, multimodal and long-context capabilities. T5Gemma 2 follows the adaptation recipe (via UL2) in T5Gemma -- adapting a pretrained decoder-only model into an encoder-decoder model, and extends it from text-only regime to multimodal based on the Gemma 3 models. We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling. Similar to T5Gemma, T5Gemma 2 yields comparable or better pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training performance than its Gemma 3 counterpart. We release the pretrained models (270M-270M, 1B-1B and 4B-4B) to the community for future research.

### [3] [Integrating Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs to Capture Political Viewpoints in News Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14887)
*Massimiliano Fadda,Enrico Motta,Francesco Osborne,Diego Reforgiato Recupero,Angelo Salatino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves a pipeline for analyzing news media viewpoints by fine-tuning LLMs for classification and enriching claim representations with Wikidata actor descriptions, achieving best results when integrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: News media shapes political discourse through specific topics and viewpoints, and understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether media offers balanced coverage of public debates.

Method: Improves existing pipeline by: 1) fine-tuning Large Language Models for viewpoint classification, and 2) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors from Wikidata. Evaluated on UK immigration debate benchmark.

Result: Both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, but their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.

Conclusion: The enhanced pipeline combining fine-tuned LLMs with Wikidata-enriched claim representations provides superior viewpoint classification for analyzing media discourse, especially for complex topics like immigration.

Abstract: News sources play a central role in democratic societies by shaping political and social discourse through specific topics, viewpoints and voices. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.

### [4] [DrugRAG: Enhancing Pharmacy LLM Performance Through A Novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14896)
*Houman Kazemzadeh,Kiarash Mokhtari Dizaji,Seyed Reza Tavakoli,Farbod Davoodi,MohammadReza KarimiNejad,Parham Abed Azad,Ali Sabzi,Armin Khosravi,Siavash Ahmadi,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Glolamali Aminian,Tahereh Javaheri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrugRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline using external structured drug knowledge, improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy licensure questions without model modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLM performance on pharmacy QA tasks and develop a method to improve their accuracy by integrating external, validated drug knowledge sources.

Method: Benchmarked 11 LLMs (8B to 70B+ parameters) on 141 pharmacy questions, then developed DrugRAG - a three-step RAG pipeline that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments prompts with evidence-based context.

Result: Baseline accuracy ranged 46%-92% (GPT-5: 92%, o3: 89%). Models <8B parameters scored <50%. DrugRAG improved all models by 7-21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61%→71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46%→67%).

Conclusion: External structured drug knowledge integration via DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying models, providing a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate large language model (LLM) performance on pharmacy licensure-style question-answering (QA) tasks and develop an external knowledge integration method to improve their accuracy.
  Methods: We benchmarked eleven existing LLMs with varying parameter sizes (8 billion to 70+ billion) using a 141-question pharmacy dataset. We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters.
  Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models. This approach provides a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications with evidence-based information.

### [5] [Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA): A Game Theoretic and Optimization Driven Approach to Efficient Contextual Modeling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14925)
*Caner Erden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAHA proposes a hierarchical attention framework with multiscale decomposition and optimization-based aggregation to reduce quadratic complexity of self-attention while preserving global dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) is a fundamental bottleneck for scaling Large Language Models to long-context tasks. Existing sparse and linearized attention methods often compromise global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively.

Method: MAHA reformulates attention through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. It dynamically partitions input sequences into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators, then models scale fusion as a resource allocation problem solved via convex optimization or Nash equilibrium-based game-theoretic approaches. Implemented within a hybrid dilated-convolutional transformer backbone with differentiable optimization layers for end-to-end training.

Result: MAHA achieves superior scalability with 81% reduction in computational cost at sequence length 4096 compared to standard attention, while maintaining balance between local nuance and global context fidelity.

Conclusion: MAHA bridges optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for next-generation LLMs by theoretically optimizing the balance between computational efficiency and representation quality.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs.

### [6] [Parameter Efficient Multimodal Instruction Tuning for Romanian Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14926)
*George-Andrei Dima,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers translate Flickr30k to Romanian and extend it for visual QA, then fine-tune open-source VLMs (LLaMA, LLaVA, Qwen2) using LoRA, achieving improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA and image description with reduced grammatical errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the multimodal NLP resource gap for low-resource languages, specifically Romanian, by creating Romanian multimodal datasets and improving Romanian capabilities in vision-language models.

Method: 1) Translate Flickr30k dataset to Romanian and extend it for visual question answering using open-source LLMs. 2) Fine-tune three open-source VLM families (LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, Qwen2) on Romanian visual QA using parameter-efficient LoRA method.

Result: Models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA and zero-shot image description generation. Qwen2-VL-RoVQA (7B parameters) achieves +6.05% and +2.61% BERTScore F1 improvements over original version. Substantial reduction in grammatical errors indicates improved Romanian fluency.

Conclusion: The approach successfully reduces the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian, demonstrating that fine-tuning on translated datasets with LoRA effectively improves Romanian capabilities in VLMs while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Focusing on low-resource languages is an essential step toward democratizing generative AI. In this work, we contribute to reducing the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian. We translate the widely known Flickr30k dataset into Romanian and further extend it for visual question answering by leveraging open-source LLMs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our datasets by fine-tuning open-source VLMs on Romanian visual question answering. We select VLMs from three widely used model families: LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, and Qwen2. For fine-tuning, we employ the parameter-efficient LoRA method. Our models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA, as well as on tasks they were not trained on, such as Romanian image description generation. The seven-billion-parameter Qwen2-VL-RoVQA obtains top scores on both tasks, with improvements of +6.05% and +2.61% in BERTScore F1 over its original version. Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.

### [7] [Cross-Tokenizer Likelihood Scoring Algorithms for Language Model Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14954)
*Buu Phan,Ashish Khisti,Karen Ullrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for computing likelihood ratios between language models with different tokenizers by exploiting BPE's recursive structure, enabling efficient cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation requires computing likelihood ratios between teacher and student models, but this becomes challenging when they use different tokenizers (e.g., edge devices need smaller vocabularies for memory efficiency).

Method: Uncover implicit recursive structure in Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to create probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Handles two scenarios: 1) student vocabulary is subset of teacher vocabulary (exact likelihoods with O(1) evaluations), 2) general arbitrary vocabularies (lossless procedure with fast approximation).

Result: For subset regime: up to 12% memory footprint reduction for Qwen2.5-1.5B model with up to 4% performance improvement. For general case: improves GSM8K mathematical reasoning accuracy by over 2% over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The method enables effective knowledge distillation across different tokenizers by leveraging BPE's recursive structure, making cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring practical for both subset and arbitrary vocabulary scenarios.

Abstract: Computing next-token likelihood ratios between two language models (LMs) is a standard task in training paradigms such as knowledge distillation. Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical. Applied to distillation for mathematical reasoning, our approach improves GSM8K accuracy by more than 2% over the current state of the art.

*Yiming Cui,Xin Yao,Yuxuan Qin,Xin Li,Shijin Wang,Guoping Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of 40 multimodal LLMs on chemistry Olympiad questions reveals significant challenges in scientific reasoning, with many models struggling with modality fusion and visual-textual integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal scientific reasoning, especially in chemistry with its symbolic diagrams and molecular structures, remains a major challenge for LLMs. There's a need to systematically evaluate how current models handle integrated visual and textual reasoning in domain-specific scientific contexts.

Method: Evaluated 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs (including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL) on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions from over 20 years of US National Chemistry Olympiad exams. Used Chain-of-Thought prompting and conducted ablation studies with occlusion-based interpretability analysis.

Result: Many models struggle with modality fusion - in some cases, removing images actually improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding. Models show critical limitations in scientific reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have significant limitations in scientific reasoning, particularly in chemistry. The work provides a benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and highlights the need for advances at the intersection of AI and scientific reasoning, with actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable systems.

Abstract: Multimodal scientific reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in chemistry, where problem-solving relies on symbolic diagrams, molecular structures, and structured visual data. Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning.

### [9] [DASH: Dialogue-Aware Similarity and Handshake Recognition for Topic Segmentation in Public-Channel Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15042)
*Sijin Sun,Liangbin Zhao,Ming Deng,Xiuju Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DASH-DTS is an LLM-based framework for dialogue topic segmentation that introduces dialogue handshake recognition, similarity-guided example selection, and selective sample generation, achieving state-of-the-art results on maritime VHF communications and standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with dialogue topic segmentation in task-oriented public-channel communications like maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit topic transitions, requiring more robust and interpretable solutions.

Method: DASH-DTS uses three key components: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition, (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection, and (3) generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve discrimination and robustness.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on both the new VHF-Dial dataset (first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications) and standard benchmarks, providing interpretable reasoning and confidence scores.

Conclusion: DASH-DTS establishes a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues, advancing research in dialogue topic segmentation for real-world communication scenarios.

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) is crucial for understanding task-oriented public-channel communications, such as maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit transitions. To address the limitations of traditional methods, we propose DASH-DTS, a novel LLM-based framework. Its core contributions are: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition; (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection; and (3) the generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve model discrimination and robustness. Additionally, we release VHF-Dial, the first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications, to advance research in this domain. DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.

### [10] [SGM: Safety Glasses for Multimodal Large Language Models via Neuron-Level Detoxification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15052)
*Hongbo Wang,MaungMaung AprilPyone,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGM is a white-box neuron-level intervention method that selectively recalibrates toxic expert neurons in MLLMs via soft suppression, reducing toxicity from 48.2% to 2.5% while preserving model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining data, creating safety risks that existing training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle, especially under adversarial triggers.

Method: SGM uses expertise-weighted soft suppression to selectively recalibrate a small set of toxic expert neurons, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without parameter updates. It also introduces MM-TOXIC-QA evaluation framework and can be combined with other methods as SGM*.

Result: Experiments show SGM reduces toxicity rates from 48.2% to 2.5% in standard and adversarial conditions while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. Combined defenses (SGM*) provide even stronger safety performance.

Conclusion: SGM provides an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation that acts like "safety glasses" for toxic neurons, offering effective detoxification without compromising model capabilities.

Abstract: Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort.
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.

### [11] [The Meta-Prompting Protocol: Orchestrating LLMs via Adversarial Feedback Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15053)
*Fanzhe Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A theoretical framework called Meta-Prompting Protocol that formalizes LLM orchestration as a programmable, self-optimizing system using an Adversarial Trinity architecture to provide deterministic guarantees for mission-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current heuristic-based prompt engineering fails to provide deterministic guarantees needed for LLMs to transition from chat interfaces to reliable software components in mission-critical applications.

Method: Introduces Meta-Prompting Protocol with Adversarial Trinity topology (Generator, Auditor, Optimizer), treats natural language instructions as differentiable variables in semantic computation graphs, uses textual critiques as gradients, and leverages DSPy and TextGrad for implementation.

Result: Demonstrates theoretical viability of the approach for mitigating hallucination and preventing model collapse, establishing foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in probabilistic computing.

Conclusion: The framework provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for transforming LLMs into reliable software components with deterministic guarantees through formalized orchestration and self-optimization mechanisms.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.

### [12] [Beyond Majority Voting: Towards Fine-grained and More Reliable Reward Signal for Test-Time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15146)
*Weiqin Wang,Yile Wang,Kehao Chen,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOPE improves test-time RL for LLMs by using step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-labels and dynamic subgroup partitioning to reduce confirmation bias and sparse reward issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time RL with majority voting suffers from confirmation bias and sparse rewards, limiting performance despite being complementary to RLVR for improving LLM reasoning.

Method: SCOPE integrates step-wise confidence into pseudo-label deduction (prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths) and dynamically partitions candidate outputs into subgroups balancing quality vs diversity, then derives local consensus via repeat sampling for each subgroup.

Result: SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines across various models and benchmarks, achieving 13.1% relative improvement on AIME 2025 and 8.1% on AMC.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively addresses confirmation bias and sparse reward issues in test-time RL through confidence-weighted pseudo-labels and dynamic subgroup partitioning, enabling better LLM reasoning improvement.

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning mitigates the reliance on annotated data by using majority voting results as pseudo-labels, emerging as a complementary direction to reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1\% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1\% on AMC.

### [14] [MCP-SafetyBench: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models with Real-World MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15163)
*Xuanjun Zong,Zhiqi Shen,Lei Wang,Yunshi Lan,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCP-SafetyBench is a comprehensive safety benchmark for evaluating LLM agents using Model Context Protocol, covering realistic multi-turn workflows across 5 domains with 20 attack types, revealing significant safety gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition of LLMs into agentic systems using Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage of multi-server workflows.

Method: Built MCP-SafetyBench on real MCP servers with realistic multi-turn evaluation across 5 domains (browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, web search). Incorporated unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, including tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty.

Result: Systematic evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs revealed large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow.

Conclusion: Results highlight urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into agentic systems that reason, plan, and operate external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

### [15] [From NLG Evaluation to Modern Student Assessment in the Era of ChatGPT: The Great Misalignment Problem and Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15183)
*Mika Hämäläinen,Kimmo Leiviskä*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a parallel between NLG evaluation and student grading, both facing a "Great Misalignment Problem" where traditional assessment methods fail when students use AI tools like ChatGPT. It proposes a process-based P-MFA model inspired by multi-factor authentication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing similarity between evaluating natural language generation systems and assessing student work in universities. With students increasingly using AI tools like ChatGPT, traditional assessment methods that focus only on final outputs have become invalid, creating what the authors call the "Great Misalignment Problem" in both domains.

Method: The paper introduces the Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA) model, which is a process-based, multi-evidence framework. This approach is inspired by the logic of multi-factor authentication, shifting focus from evaluating only final products to assessing the learning process through multiple evidence sources.

Result: While the abstract doesn't present empirical results, it proposes a conceptual framework (P-MFA) to address the assessment validity crisis caused by AI tool usage in education, suggesting a shift toward process-based evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that both NLG evaluation and student assessment face similar challenges due to AI tool adoption, requiring new assessment approaches like the proposed P-MFA model that emphasizes learning processes over final outputs to maintain validity in educational evaluation.

Abstract: This paper explores the growing epistemic parallel between NLG evaluation and grading of students in a Finnish University. We argue that both domains are experiencing a Great Misalignment Problem. As students increasingly use tools like ChatGPT to produce sophisticated outputs, traditional assessment methods that focus on final products rather than learning processes have lost their validity. To address this, we introduce the Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA) model, a process-based, multi-evidence framework inspired by the logic of multi-factor authentication.

### [16] [RFKG-CoT: Relation-Driven Adaptive Hop-count Selection and Few-Shot Path Guidance for Knowledge-Aware QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15219)
*Chao Zhang,Minghan Li,Tianrui Lv,Guodong Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RFKG-CoT improves knowledge graph reasoning for LLMs by dynamically adjusting hop counts based on relations and providing few-shot path guidance, reducing hallucinations in QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. Existing methods like KG-CoT have rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilize reasoning paths (lack of guidance).

Method: 1) Relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct relations, 2-hop for indirect chains) via relation mask. 2) Few-shot in-context learning path guidance with CoT that constructs "question-paths-answer" examples to enhance LLMs' path understanding.

Result: Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 percentage points (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and path prompt are complementary.

Conclusion: RFKG-CoT's adaptive hop selection and path guidance jointly transform KG evidence into more faithful answers, addressing limitations of rigid reasoning in existing KG-enhanced LLM methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct "brother" relations, 2-hop for indirect "father-son" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a "question-paths-answer" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.

*Yash Bhaskar,Parameswari Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Yes-MT team's WMT 2024 submission explores multiple approaches for low-resource Indic language translation between English and Assamese, Mizo, Khasi, and Manipuri, evaluating methods including fine-tuning pre-trained models, LLM prompting, and training Transformers from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low-resource machine translation for Indic languages and explore effective approaches for English-Assamese, English-Mizo, English-Khasi, and English-Manipuri translation tasks.

Method: Multiple approaches were explored: 1) Fine-tuning pre-trained models (mT5, IndicBart) in multilingual/monolingual settings, 2) LoRA fine-tuning of IndicTrans2, 3) Zero-shot/few-shot prompting with LLMs (Llama 3, Mixtral 8x7b), 4) LoRA supervised fine-tuning of Llama 3, and 5) Training Transformer models from scratch.

Result: Results were evaluated on WMT23 test data using SacreBLEU and CHRF metrics, highlighting the challenges of low-resource translation and showing the potential of LLMs, particularly when fine-tuned.

Conclusion: Low-resource Indic language translation remains challenging, but LLMs show promise for these tasks, especially when fine-tuned using approaches like LoRA, though the specific performance rankings among methods are not detailed in the abstract.

Abstract: This paper presents the systems submitted by the Yes-MT team for the Low-Resource Indic Language Translation Shared Task at WMT 2024 (Pakray et al., 2024), focusing on translating between English and the Assamese, Mizo, Khasi, and Manipuri languages. The experiments explored various approaches, including fine-tuning pre-trained models like mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) and IndicBart (Dabre et al., 2021) in both multilingual and monolingual settings, LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) fine-tuning IndicTrans2 (Gala et al., 2023), zero-shot and few-shot prompting (Brown, 2020) with large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) and Mixtral 8x7b (Jiang et al., 2024), LoRA supervised fine-tuning of Llama 3 (Mecklenburg et al., 2024), and training Transformer models (Vaswani, 2017) from scratch. The results were evaluated on the WMT23 Low-Resource Indic Language Translation Shared Task test data using SacreBLEU (Post, 2018) and CHRF (Popovic, 2015), highlighting the challenges of low-resource translation and the potential of LLMs for these tasks, particularly with fine-tuning.

### [18] [FAME: Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15235)
*Claudio Savelli,Moreno La Quatra,Alkis Koudounas,Flavio Giobergia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAME is a synthetic multilingual benchmark for evaluating machine unlearning in LLMs across 5 languages, supporting both entity-level and instance-level forgetting with fictional actor biographies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning benchmarks are limited to English and only support entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person), creating a need for a more comprehensive multilingual benchmark that supports both entity-level and instance-level unlearning.

Method: Created FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure) - a synthetic benchmark with 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs across English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Each biography includes 20 topics organized into structured categories, with two dataset splits for different unlearning scenarios.

Result: Provides a controlled evaluation benchmark that ensures information was never encountered during model pretraining (due to fictional data), enabling systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages and supporting both entity-level and instance-level forgetting scenarios.

Conclusion: FAME addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by offering multilingual support and both entity-level/instance-level unlearning evaluation, enabling more comprehensive assessment of machine unlearning techniques in LLMs while maintaining controlled experimental conditions.

Abstract: LLMs trained on web-scale data raise concerns about privacy and the right to be forgotten. To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.

### [19] [The Moralization Corpus: Frame-Based Annotation and Analysis of Moralizing Speech Acts across Diverse Text Genres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15248)
*Maria Becker,Mirko Sommer,Lars Tapken,Yi Wan Teh,Bruno Brocai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Moralization Corpus, a multi-genre German dataset for analyzing moral values in argumentative discourse, develops a frame-based annotation scheme, and evaluates LLMs for moralization detection and component extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moralizations (arguments using moral values to justify demands) are an underexplored form of persuasive communication that is pragmatically complex and often implicit, posing challenges for both human annotators and NLP systems.

Method: Developed a frame-based annotation scheme capturing moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists; applied it to diverse German texts (political debates, news articles, online discussions); evaluated LLMs under varied prompting conditions for moralization detection and component extraction.

Result: Detailed prompt instructions had greater effect than few-shot or explanation-based prompting; moralization detection remains highly subjective and context-sensitive; all data, annotation guidelines, and code are released for future research.

Conclusion: The Moralization Corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across formats and domains, revealing the challenges of both automatic and manual analysis of moralizations, and provides resources for interdisciplinary research on moral discourse in NLP.

Abstract: Moralizations - arguments that invoke moral values to justify demands or positions - are a yet underexplored form of persuasive communication. We present the Moralization Corpus, a novel multi-genre dataset designed to analyze how moral values are strategically used in argumentative discourse. Moralizations are pragmatically complex and often implicit, posing significant challenges for both human annotators and NLP systems. We develop a frame-based annotation scheme that captures the constitutive elements of moralizations - moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists - and apply it to a diverse set of German texts, including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains. We further evaluate several large language models (LLMs) under varied prompting conditions for the task of moralization detection and moralization component extraction and compare it to human annotations in order to investigate the challenges of automatic and manual analysis of moralizations. Results show that detailed prompt instructions has a greater effect than few-shot or explanation-based prompting, and that moralization remains a highly subjective and context-sensitive task. We release all data, annotation guidelines, and code to foster future interdisciplinary research on moral discourse and moral reasoning in NLP.

*Piyawoot Songsiritat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynGP500 is a synthetic dataset of 500 Australian GP medical notes that combines curriculum-based clinical coverage with realistic complexity to improve NLP model training while protecting patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in Australian general practice NLP resources by creating synthetic data that includes both common and rare conditions, avoids privacy concerns of real patient data, and captures authentic clinical complexity often missing from sanitized synthetic datasets.

Method: Created 500 synthetic GP notes using clinician curation, integrated RACGP 2022 Curriculum for clinical breadth, calibrated prevalence using BEACH study data, included diverse consultation contexts, and intentionally incorporated realistic "messiness" like typos, non-adherence, and socioeconomic barriers.

Result: Multi-faceted validation shows epidemiological alignment with real Australian GP patterns, high linguistic variation, broad semantic coverage, and improved F1 scores in downstream medical concept extraction tasks compared to other datasets.

Conclusion: SynGP500 provides a valuable resource for Australian clinical NLP research and education that balances realistic complexity with privacy protection, potentially enabling more generalizable model training than datasets limited by naturally occurring case distributions.

Abstract: We introduce SynGP500, a clinician-curated collection of 500 synthetic Australian general practice medical notes. The dataset integrates curriculum-based clinical breadth (RACGP 2022 Curriculum), epidemiologically-calibrated prevalence (BEACH study), and diverse consultation contexts. This approach systematically includes both common presentations and less-common curriculum-specified conditions that GPs must recognize but appear infrequently in single practice populations, potentially supporting more generalizable model training than datasets constrained by naturally occurring case distributions. SynGP500 is messy by design, reflecting the authentic complexity of healthcare delivery: telegraphic documentation, typos, patient non-adherence, socioeconomic barriers, and clinician-patient disagreements, unlike sanitized synthetic datasets that obscure clinical realities. Multi-faceted validation demonstrates dataset quality through epidemiological alignment with real Australian GP consultation patterns (BEACH study), stylometric analysis confirming high linguistic variation, semantic diversity analysis demonstrating broad coverage, and exploratory downstream evaluation using self-supervised medical concept extraction, showing F1 improvements. SynGP500 addresses a critical national gap, providing researchers and educators with a resource for developing and evaluating clinical NLP methods for Australian general practice while inherently protecting patient privacy.

### [21] [Well Begun, Half Done: Reinforcement Learning with Prefix Optimization for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15274)
*Yiliu Sun,Zicheng Zhao,Yang Wei,Yanfang Zhang,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPPO is a new RLVR method that focuses optimization on prefix tokens in LLM reasoning, achieving better performance with fewer training tokens by leveraging the Beginning Lock-in Effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR approaches train uniformly across all tokens, wasting effort on low-return tokens and missing opportunities to optimize high-impact prefix tokens that significantly influence subsequent reasoning.

Method: PPPO focuses on prefix reasoning optimization based on the Beginning Lock-in Effect. It uses Progressive Prefix Retention (gradually increasing retained prefix tokens) and Continuation Accumulated Reward (sampling multiple continuations to reduce reward bias).

Result: PPPO outperforms existing RLVR methods with 18.02% accuracy improvement using only 26.17% of training tokens across various reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted optimization of prefix reasoning tokens is more effective than uniform token training, and PPPO's progressive approach significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities with greater efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.

*Xiaotian Zhang,Yuan Wang,Ruizhe Chen,Zeya Wang,Runchen Hou,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonalAgent: A lifelong conversational agent that continuously learns and adapts to individual user preferences through sequential decision-making and dynamic profile refinement, outperforming existing methods in both ideal and noisy contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment techniques focus on universal human values or static preferences, failing to address long-term personalization needs and the user cold-start problem in interactive systems.

Method: PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions and framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task.

Result: PersonalAgent achieves superior performance over prompt-based and policy optimization baselines in both ideal and noisy conversational contexts while maintaining cross-session preference consistency. Human evaluation confirms it captures user preferences naturally and coherently.

Conclusion: Lifelong personalization is crucial for developing more inclusive and adaptive conversational agents, and PersonalAgent demonstrates effective continuous preference learning and adaptation.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive systems necessitates a deep alignment with the nuanced and dynamic preferences of individual users. Current alignment techniques predominantly address universal human values or static, single-turn preferences, thereby failing to address the critical needs of long-term personalization and the initial user cold-start problem. To bridge this gap, we propose PersonalAgent, a novel user-centric lifelong agent designed to continuously infer and adapt to user preferences. PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions, framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task. Experiments show that PersonalAgent achieves superior performance over strong prompt-based and policy optimization baselines, not only in idealized but also in noisy conversational contexts, while preserving cross-session preference consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation confirms that PersonalAgent excels at capturing user preferences naturally and coherently. Our findings underscore the importance of lifelong personalization for developing more inclusive and adaptive conversational agents. Our code is available here.

### [23] [Evaluating LLMs for Zeolite Synthesis Event Extraction (ZSEE): A Systematic Analysis of Prompting Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15312)
*Charan Prakash Rathore,Saumi Ray,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show strong performance on high-level event classification (80-90% F1) but limited effectiveness (50-65% F1) for fine-grained extraction of zeolite synthesis parameters, with advanced prompting providing minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate LLMs for extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures, addressing the gap in domain-specific scientific information extraction and determining the efficacy of different prompting strategies.

Method: Evaluated four prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, reflection-based) across six state-of-the-art LLMs on four key subtasks: event type classification, trigger text identification, argument role extraction, and argument text extraction using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences.

Result: Strong performance on event type classification (80-90% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks (50-65% F1). GPT-5-mini showed extreme prompt sensitivity (11-79% F1 variation). Advanced prompting provided minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations.

Conclusion: While LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models. The study provides quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction and identifies systematic limitations including hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances.

Abstract: Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.

TL;DR: Arabic Applied Linguistics research shows extreme thematic dispersion (Δ=0.194), indicating high heterogeneity across eight sub-disciplines rather than concentration in any single area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the thematic structure of contemporary Arabic Applied Linguistics research using Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion, addressing how research topics are distributed across the field.

Method: Applied Brookes' Δ formula to analyze 1,564 publications (2019-2025) classified into eight core sub-disciplines, using a comprehensive real-world dataset to calculate dispersion index.

Result: Found extremely low dispersion index (Δ=0.194), indicating pronounced thematic heterogeneity; Computational Linguistics is dominant but not hegemonic, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields.

Conclusion: Arabic Applied Linguistics exhibits extreme thematic dispersion rather than concentration, demonstrating the utility of Brookes' formula for field characterization and providing a replicable bibliometric methodology for assessing disciplinary structure.

Abstract: This study applies Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion (Δ) to analyze the thematic structure of contemporary Arabic Applied Linguistics research. Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of Δ = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields. This study clarifies the correct application of Brookes' original formula, demonstrates its utility for field characterization, and provides a replicable bibliometric methodology for assessing disciplinary structure across domains.

### [25] [Adversarial versification in portuguese as a jailbreak operator in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15353)
*Joao Queiroz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Versification (rewriting prompts as poetry) is a highly effective universal jailbreak mechanism that bypasses LLM safety guardrails, with manual poems achieving ~62% attack success rate and automated versions ~43%, revealing that current alignment methods are overly dependent on surface patterns rather than semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to demonstrate that current LLM alignment methods have a critical vulnerability: they rely too heavily on surface patterns rather than deep semantic understanding. The researchers discovered that simply rewriting refused instructions as poetry can bypass safety mechanisms, exposing fundamental flaws in RLHF, constitutional AI, and other alignment approaches.

Method: Researchers tested adversarial poetry as a jailbreak mechanism by rewriting routinely refused instructions in verse form. They evaluated this approach using benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate, comparing prose vs. verse versions of the same prompts. The study examined both manually written poems and automated versions across various LLMs.

Result: Versification produces up to 18x more safety failures compared to prose. Manual poems achieve approximately 62% attack success rate (ASR), automated versions reach 43%, with some models showing over 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural and consistent across systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines.

Conclusion: Current alignment regimes have deep limitations as they are excessively dependent on surface patterns rather than semantic understanding. Versification displaces prompts into sparsely supervised latent regions, bypassing guardrails. The study also identifies a critical gap: lack of evaluation in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity and rich poetic tradition that could reveal additional vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap. Experimental protocols must parameterise scansion, metre, and prosodic variation to test vulnerabilities specific to Lusophone patterns, which are currently ignored.

*Zhengyi Zhao,Shubo Zhang,Yuxi Zhang,Huimin Wang,Binyang Li,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Denser is a framework that uses compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate reasoning computations while maintaining human-readable final answers, reducing token usage by up to 62% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches use uniform language density for both reasoning and answering, which is computationally inefficient. The authors observe that reasoning serves a computational function for the model while answering serves a communicative function for humans, enabling separate optimization of information density.

Method: Denser uses a three-component framework: 1) query processing module that analyzes input problems, 2) high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and 3) answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions.

Result: Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning QA benchmarks shows Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy. Efficiency gains are particularly significant for complex multi-step reasoning problems.

Conclusion: Separating information density optimization for reasoning and answering phases enables significant computational efficiency improvements in LLMs without sacrificing accuracy, offering a promising direction for more efficient reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches employ uniform language density for both intermediate reasoning and final answers, leading to computational inefficiency. Our observation found that reasoning process serves a computational function for the model itself, while answering serves a communicative function for human understanding. This distinction enables the use of compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate computations while maintaining human-readable final explanations. To address this inefficiency, we present Denser: \underline{D}ual-d\underline{ens}ity inf\underline{er}ence, a novel framework that optimizes information density separately for reasoning and answering phases. Our framework implements this through three components: a query processing module that analyzes input problems, a high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and an answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions. Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning question answering benchmarks demonstrates that Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62\% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy. These efficiency gains are particularly significant for complex multi-step reasoning problems where traditional methods generate extensive explanations.

TL;DR: MI-LLMs: Fine-tuning Chinese LLMs on MI-style counseling data enables AI to perform motivational interviewing with promising results, offering scalable health behavior support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivational interviewing is effective but limited by need for highly trained human counselors; LLMs offer potential for scalable AI-assisted health behavior change support.

Method: Curated Chinese counseling corpora, used GPT-4 to transcribe dialogues into MI-style conversations, fine-tuned three Chinese LLMs (Baichuan2, ChatGLM-4, Llama-3) on this data, evaluated with automatic metrics and expert manual coding using MITI.

Result: Fine-tuning improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores; MI-LLMs achieved technical/relational global scores and MI-adherent ratios approaching real MI dialogues, though complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained lower.

Conclusion: MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow LLMs with core MI-consistent behaviors, suggesting scalable AI-assisted health support pathway, but needs work on data scale, complex MI skills, and real-world trials.

Abstract: Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective counseling approach for promoting health behavior change, but its impact is constrained by the need for highly trained human counselors. Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising, using a novel annotated dataset of news headlines to analyze public emotions (Outrage, Hope, Despair) and outperforming multilingual models with language-specific approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While sentiment analysis has been explored in contexts like elections and social media, there's a significant gap in understanding emotional dynamics during civil unrest, particularly in the Bangla language. The study aims to address this by analyzing public sentiment during Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising.

Method: Created a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair.

Compared language-specific models against multilingual transformers (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and traditional ML methods (SVM, Logistic Regression).

Result: The language-specific model outperformed multilingual transformers (mBERT: 67%, XLM-RoBERTa: 71%) and traditional machine learning methods (SVM and Logistic Regression: both 70%). LDA identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analysis revealed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns.

Conclusion: The results highlight the effectiveness of language-specific models for sentiment analysis in Bangla during political crises. The study offers valuable insights into public sentiment during political turmoil and demonstrates the importance of language-specific approaches over multilingual models for understanding emotional dynamics in civil unrest contexts.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, an emerging research area within natural language processing (NLP), has primarily been explored in contexts like elections and social media trends, but there remains a significant gap in understanding emotional dynamics during civil unrest, particularly in the Bangla language. Our study pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during a national crisis by examining public emotions amid Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising. We curated a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair. Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analyzed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns. It outperformed multilingual transformers (mBERT: 67%, XLM-RoBERTa: 71%) and traditional machine learning methods (SVM and Logistic Regression: both 70%). These results highlight the effectiveness of language-specific models and offer valuable insights into public sentiment during political turmoil.

### [30] [CTkvr: KV Cache Retrieval for Long-Context LLMs via Centroid then Token Indexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15550)
*Kuan Lu,Shuhang Lin,Sai Wu,Yichen Yao,Junhan Yang,Huan Li,Wei Chu,Xu Yinghui,Yuan Qi,Gang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CTKVR is a two-stage KV cache retrieval method for LLMs that uses centroid-based indexing followed by token-level refinement to improve inference efficiency in long-context scenarios while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face efficiency challenges in long-context scenarios due to high memory overhead from KV cache and increased latency from excessive memory accesses. Existing dynamic KV selection methods have trade-offs: block-level indexing reduces accuracy by retrieving irrelevant entries, while token-level indexing has high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms.

Method: CTKVR uses a two-stage retrieval strategy: 1) Lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, and 2) Token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This leverages the observation that adjacent query vectors after RoPE exhibit high similarity and share most top-k KV cache entries. The system implements optimized CPU-GPU co-execution for indexing construction and search.

Result: CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. It delivers 3x and 4x throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

Conclusion: CTKVR effectively addresses the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in KV cache retrieval for long-context LLM inference by combining centroid-based indexing with token-level refinement, achieving significant throughput improvements while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

*Peter Dekker,Heikki Rasilo,Bart de Boer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies learnability of verbal inflection classes using Adaptive Resonance Theory neural network for unsupervised clustering of lexemes in Latin, Portuguese, and Estonian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inflection classes are important for morphological acquisition and processing, but their learnability by individual language users needs computational investigation.

Method: Uses Adaptive Resonance Theory neural network with vigilance parameter for unsupervised clustering of lexemes into inflection classes, applied to Latin, Portuguese, and Estonian data.

Result: Clustering similarity to attested inflection classes varies by language complexity; best performance in narrow vigilance region; learned features align with linguistic descriptions.

Conclusion: The model successfully captures inflection class patterns and could be used in agent-based models to study historical changes in inflection classes.

Abstract: The concept of inflection classes is an abstraction used by linguists, and provides a means to describe patterns in languages that give an analogical base for deducing previously unencountered forms. This ability is an important part of morphological acquisition and processing. We study the learnability of a system of verbal inflection classes by the individual language user by performing unsupervised clustering of lexemes into inflection classes. As a cognitively plausible and interpretable computational model, we use Adaptive Resonance Theory, a neural network with a parameter that determines the degree of generalisation (vigilance). The model is applied to Latin, Portuguese and Estonian. The similarity of clustering to attested inflection classes varies depending on the complexity of the inflectional system. We find the best performance in a narrow region of the generalisation parameter. The learned features extracted from the model show similarity with linguistic descriptions of the inflection classes. The proposed model could be used to study change in inflection classes in the future, by including it in an agent-based model.

*Dakota Ellis,Samy Bakikerali,Wanshan Chen,Bao Dinh,Uyen Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed an automated Specialized Word List (SWL) model that outperforms the traditional General Service List (GSL) approach, achieving 95% language coverage with fewer words through objective, scalable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GSL creation requires linguistic expertise, subjective input, and significant time, making it inefficient and difficult to scale for diverse language learners' needs.

Method: Developed an automated model to create Specialized Word Lists (SWLs) using objective criteria only, allowing for tailored word lists specific to subsets of language corpora.

Result: The SWLs created using the model outperformed the industry standard NGSL, reaching the required 95% coverage for language comprehension with fewer words.

Conclusion: Automated SWL creation using objective criteria enables scalable, tailored vocabulary learning solutions that are more efficient than traditional expert-driven approaches.

Abstract: Traditional linguists have proposed the use of a General Service List (GSL) to assist new language learners in identifying the most important words in English. This process requires linguistic expertise, subjective input, and a considerable amount of time. We attempt to create our own GSL and evaluate its practicality against the industry standard (The NGSL). We found creating a Specialized Word List (SWL), or a word list specific to a subset of the overall corpus, to be the most practical way for language-learners to optimize the process. The SWL's that we created using our model outperformed the industry standard, reaching the 95% coverage required for language comprehension with fewer words comparatively. By restricting the SWL process to objective criteria only, it can be automated, scaled, and tailored to the needs of language-learners across the globe.

### [33] [An Empirical Study on Chinese Character Decomposition in Multiword Expression-Aware Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15556)
*Lifeng Han,Gareth J. F. Jones,Alan F. Smeaton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how Chinese character decomposition technology can improve neural machine translation, particularly for handling Multi-word Expressions (MWEs) in Chinese and related Asian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MWEs create significant challenges in NLP tasks due to ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, and variations. While Western languages (especially English) have made substantial progress with techniques like sub-word modeling (BPE), Chinese and related Asian languages lag behind because these techniques cannot be directly applied to ideographic scripts.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic study of Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation. They examine how character decomposition contributes to representing original meanings of Chinese words/characters and addresses MWE translation challenges.

Result: The abstract doesn't provide specific experimental results, but indicates that experiments were conducted to examine the effectiveness of Chinese character decomposition technology for MWE translation.

Conclusion: Chinese character decomposition technology shows promise for improving neural machine translation of MWEs in Chinese and related Asian languages, addressing the gap in NLP progress compared to Western languages.

Abstract: Word meaning, representation, and interpretation play fundamental roles in natural language understanding (NLU), natural language processing (NLP), and natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.

*Benjamin Minixhofer,Tyler Murray,Tomasz Limisiewicz,Anna Korhonen,Luke Zettlemoyer,Noah A. Smith,Edoardo M. Ponti,Luca Soldaini,Valentin Hofmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bolmo is a family of competitive open byte-level language models trained by converting existing subword models through byteification, achieving performance close to subword models with minimal training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of subword tokenization (poor character understanding, fixed vocabulary constraints) while maintaining competitive performance with subword models, and to make byte-level LMs practical alternatives.

Method: Train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword LMs using a novel architecture that resolves expressivity mismatches, enabling effective exact distillation with less than 1% of typical pretraining tokens.

Result: Bolmo outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, beats source subword models on character understanding and some coding tasks, achieves competitive inference speeds, and can be cheaply post-trained.

Conclusion: Byte-level LMs can now be practical competitors to subword LMs across many use cases, with Bolmo demonstrating efficient conversion, strong performance, and ecosystem compatibility.

Abstract: We introduce Bolmo, the first family of competitive fully open byte-level language models (LMs) at the 1B and 7B parameter scales. In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PsyDefConv: A dialogue corpus with defense level labels and DMRS Co-Pilot pipeline that reduces annotation time by 22.4% and provides evidence-based pre-annotations for psychological defense analysis in clinical dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological defenses are crucial for mental health but difficult to reliably measure in clinical dialogues. Current methods lack standardized datasets and efficient annotation tools for analyzing defensive functioning in help-seeking conversations.

Method: Created PsyDefConv corpus with 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances (2336 help seeker turns) labeled for defense levels. Developed DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline providing evidence-based pre-annotations. Conducted counterbalanced study and expert review, plus benchmarks with language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

Result: Corpus achieved Cohen's kappa 0.639 for labeling. Co-pilot reduced annotation time by 22.4%. Expert ratings: 4.62/7 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, 4.40 for insight. Best model macro F1-score ~30% with tendency to overpredict mature defenses. Corpus analysis shows mature defenses most common with emotion-specific deviations.

Conclusion: The PsyDefConv corpus and DMRS Co-Pilot pipeline provide valuable resources for defense analysis in clinical dialogues, demonstrating practical utility in reducing annotation burden while maintaining quality. The resources will be released to support research on defensive functioning in language.

Abstract: Psychological defenses are strategies, often automatic, that people use to manage distress. Rigid or overuse of defenses is negatively linked to mental health and shapes what speakers disclose and how they accept or resist help. However, defenses are complex and difficult to reliably measure, particularly in clinical dialogues. We introduce PsyDefConv, a dialogue corpus with help seeker utterances labeled for defense level, and DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline that provides evidence-based pre-annotations. The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses. Corpus analyses confirm that mature defenses are most common and reveal emotion-specific deviations. We will release the corpus, annotations, code, and prompts to support research on defensive functioning in language.

### [36] [Evaluating Metrics for Safety with LLM-as-Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15617)
*Kester Clegg,Richard Hawkins,Ibrahim Habli,Tom Lawton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that safety-critical LLM applications require evidence-based evaluation frameworks using LLM-as-Judge evaluators with weighted metrics, context-sensitive error severity, and confidence thresholds for human review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly replacing human roles in critical information flows (like medical triage or nuclear facility scheduling), but their potential errors pose safety risks. The paper addresses how to make LLMs safe and reliable in these high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposes focusing on evaluation evidence in LLM processes, particularly using LLM-as-Judge (LaJ) evaluators. Suggests using a basket of weighted metrics, context-sensitive error severity definitions, and confidence thresholds that trigger human review when evaluator concordance is low.

Result: While deterministic evaluations aren't possible for many NLP tasks, the proposed approach can lower error risks by using weighted metrics, contextual error severity assessment, and automated human review triggers for critical judgments.

Conclusion: Safety arguments for LLMs in critical applications should focus on evaluation evidence rather than performative claims, using LaJ frameworks with weighted metrics and confidence thresholds to manage risks and ensure reliability.

Abstract: LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA achieves competitive/superior performance vs full fine-tuning on reasoning tasks at specific ranks, with distinct generalization patterns and task-specific forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PEFT methods like LoRA are computationally efficient, their configuration implications (especially rank) remain under-explored for downstream Q&A tasks and generalization behavior.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets with rank sweeps to quantify SFT vs PEFT trade-offs; analysis of internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures.

Result: LoRA achieves competitive and sometimes superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values; distinct generalization behavior and task-specific forgetting observed across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation.

Conclusion: LoRA is a viable alternative to full fine-tuning with specific advantages for reasoning tasks, and analysis of internal representations provides insights into representational drift and attention pattern changes during adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.

### [38] [Characterizing Mamba's Selective Memory using Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15653)
*Tamanna Hossain,Robert L. Logan,Ganesh Jagadeesan,Sameer Singh,Joel Tetreault,Alejandro Jaimes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSM language models (like Mamba) tend to forget specific token types (math symbols, organization entities, non-standard English) due to information loss in fixed-memory hidden states, with less frequent pretraining tokens being most vulnerable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SSMs offer fixed-memory advantages over transformers, they suffer from information loss in hidden states when processing long sequences. Prior work only studied when this loss occurs, not what types of information SSM LMs tend to forget.

Method: Trained an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from SSM hidden states, then measured information loss by comparing inputs with reconstructions. Experiments used Mamba SSM LMs (130M-1.4B parameters) on sequences of 4-256 tokens.

Result: Found significantly higher information loss rates for: 1) math-related tokens (numbers, variables), 2) organization entity mentions, and 3) alternative dialects to Standard American English. Less prevalent tokens in Mamba's pretraining data were most likely to be forgotten.

Conclusion: The study identifies specific patterns of information loss in SSM LMs, showing that token frequency in pretraining data correlates with forgetting. This provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control SSMs' ability to retain important information.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) are a promising alternative to transformers for language modeling because they use fixed memory during inference. However, this fixed memory usage requires some information loss in the hidden state when processing long sequences. While prior work has studied the sequence length at which this information loss occurs, it does not characterize the types of information SSM language models (LMs) tend to forget. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by identifying the types of tokens (e.g., parts of speech, named entities) and sequences (e.g., code, math problems) that are more frequently forgotten by SSM LMs. We achieve this by training an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from the SSM's hidden state, and measure information loss by comparing inputs with their reconstructions. We perform experiments using the Mamba family of SSM LMs (130M--1.4B) on sequences ranging from 4--256 tokens. Our results show significantly higher rates of information loss on math-related tokens (e.g., numbers, variables), mentions of organization entities, and alternative dialects to Standard American English. We then examine the frequency that these tokens appear in Mamba's pretraining data and find that less prevalent tokens tend to be the ones Mamba is most likely to forget. By identifying these patterns, our work provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control Mamba's ability to retain important information.

*Xiaodi Li,Dingcheng Li,Rujun Gao,Mahmoud Zamani,Feng Mi,Latifur Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPSEBM is a novel continual learning framework combining Energy-Based Models with Progressive Parameter Selection to prevent catastrophic forgetting in NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning faces the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously learned knowledge when adapting to new tasks. This is particularly problematic in NLP where sequential task learning is common.

Method: PPSEBM integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS). PPS allocates task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates pseudo-samples from prior tasks to guide parameter selection and preserve past knowledge.

Result: Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks show that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: PPSEBM offers a promising and robust solution for continual learning in NLP by combining parameter isolation with generative memory replay through energy-based modeling.

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: LatentQA-trained Activation Oracles (AOs) can effectively answer natural language questions about LLM activations, generalizing well to out-of-distribution tasks and matching/exceeding white-box baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for understanding LLM activations are complex and specialized. The paper aims to explore a simpler, more generalist approach using LatentQA to train models that can answer arbitrary questions about activations in natural language.

Method: Train Activation Oracles (AOs) using LatentQA approach - training LLMs to accept LLM activations as inputs and answer natural language questions about them. Evaluate in out-of-distribution settings and examine scaling with training data diversity, including classification tasks and self-supervised context prediction.

Result: AOs can recover fine-tuned information (biographical knowledge, malign propensities) not present in input text, despite never being trained on fine-tuned model activations. Narrowly-trained models generalize well, and additional training datasets yield consistent improvements. Best AOs match/exceed prior white-box baselines on all four downstream tasks and are best on 3 out of 4.

Conclusion: Diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations, suggesting LatentQA-trained AOs are effective for understanding LLM internal representations.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.

*Paul Weinmann,Ferdinand Schenck,Martin Šiklar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkyCap is a new VHR optical-SAR dataset for infrastructure monitoring that enables SAR change detection without expert annotations via optical-to-SAR label transfer, and evaluates foundation models on SAR change detection for the first time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical VHR imagery has interpretability but cloud coverage breaks acquisition cadence, while SAR enables all-weather monitoring but is difficult to annotate. There's a need for reliable SAR change detection without requiring SAR-expert annotations.

Method: Created SkyCap dataset by archive matching and co-registering SkySat (optical) and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. Used optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection labels. Performed continued pretraining of SARATR-X on SAR data and benchmarked SAR-specific foundation models against optical FMs with different preprocessing choices.

Result: MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical foundation model with dB+Z-score preprocessing, achieved best performance (F1_c = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained on Capella data. Found strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and optical model rankings don't directly transfer to SAR change detection.

Conclusion: This is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR amplitude change detection. The SkyCap dataset enables SAR change detection without expert annotations, and optical foundation models can outperform SAR-specific ones when properly preprocessed, though model rankings differ between optical and SAR domains.

Abstract: Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD.

*Tomohito Kawabata,Xinyu Zhang,Ling Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SocialNav-MoE: An efficient Mixture-of-Experts VLM for socially compliant robot navigation using reinforcement fine-tuning with semantic similarity rewards, achieving good accuracy-efficiency balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior robot navigation work focuses mainly on safety while neglecting social compliance (human comfort, social norms, contextual appropriateness). Large VLMs are computationally expensive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robots.

Method: Proposes SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts VLM for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). Introduces semantic similarity reward (SSR) to enhance decision-making. Studies different small language models (Phi, Qwen, StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned).

Result: SocialNav-MoE achieves excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency on SNEI dataset. SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards.

Conclusion: Small VLMs with MoE architecture and reinforcement fine-tuning can achieve efficient and socially compliant robot navigation suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: For robots navigating in human-populated environments, safety and social compliance are equally critical, yet prior work has mostly emphasized safety. Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Fan Bu,Rongfeng Li,Zijin Li,Ya Li,Linfeng Fan,Pei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid expert-system pipeline for optical music recognition of Chinese Jianpu notation with lyrics, achieving high accuracy without requiring massive annotated training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale OMR research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu notation and its rich lyric resources underexplored, creating a need for digitization tools for this important musical tradition.

Method: Modular expert-system pipeline combining traditional computer-vision techniques (phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) with unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings, using a top-down design that leverages prior knowledge.

Result: Successfully digitized over 5,000 melody-only songs (300,000+ notes) and 1,400+ songs with lyrics (100,000+ notes) from The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, achieving note-wise F1 = 0.951 for melody and character-wise F1 = 0.931 for aligned lyrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid expert-system approach effectively balances interpretability and accuracy for Chinese Jianpu OMR, enabling large-scale digitization of this musical tradition without requiring massive annotated training datasets.

Abstract: Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).

### [44] [AquaDiff: Diffusion-Based Underwater Image Enhancement for Addressing Color Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14760)
*Afrah Shaahid,Muzammil Behzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AquaDiff is a diffusion-based framework for underwater image enhancement that corrects color distortion while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity through chromatic prior-guided color compensation and conditional diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from severe degradation due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, causing color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications.

Method: AquaDiff integrates chromatic prior-guided color compensation with conditional diffusion, using cross-attention to fuse degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. It features an enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention, plus a novel cross-domain consistency loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks show AquaDiff provides good results compared to state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

Conclusion: AquaDiff effectively addresses underwater image degradation challenges through a diffusion-based framework that combines chromatic compensation with conditional diffusion, demonstrating strong performance in color correction and overall image enhancement.

Abstract: Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

### [45] [Improving VQA Reliability: A Dual-Assessment Approach with Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14770)
*Xixian Wu,Yang Ou,Pengchao Tian,Zian Yang,Jielei Zhang,Peiyi Li,Longwen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVR is a novel framework that enhances VLM reliability in VQA by combining self-reflection and cross-model verification to reduce hallucinations and improve uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) in VQA are prone to hallucinations that produce overconfident but incorrect answers, undermining answer reliability and trustworthiness.

Method: DAVR uses a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway employs dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: DAVR achieved first place in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025 with a leading Φ₁₀₀ score of 39.64 and 100-AUC of 97.22, demonstrating superior performance in enhancing VLM trustworthiness.

Conclusion: The DAVR framework effectively improves VLM reliability by integrating self-reflection and cross-model verification, making VLM responses more trustworthy for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

### [46] [HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870)
*Dan Ben-Ami,Gabriele Serussi,Kobi Cohen,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERBench is a new VideoQA benchmark designed to test multi-evidence integration across time, requiring aggregation of at least three non-overlapping visual cues from different video segments, with results showing current Video-LLMs perform poorly (31-42% accuracy vs 20% random baseline).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from single salient cues, under-testing reasoning that requires aggregating multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. There's a need for benchmarks that specifically assess multi-evidence integration across time.

Method: Created HERBench with 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into 12 compositional tasks probing identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. Introduced Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS) metric to quantify evidential demand. Evaluated 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs.

Result: HERBench imposes substantially higher evidential demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Video-LLMs perform poorly: accuracies of 31-42% only slightly above 20% random-guess baseline. Identified two critical bottlenecks: retrieval deficit (frame selectors overlook key evidence) and fusion deficit (failure to integrate information even when evidence is provided).

Conclusion: HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding by making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, revealing current Video-LLMs' limitations in multi-evidence integration across temporal sequences.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.

### [47] [Isolated Sign Language Recognition with Segmentation and Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14876)
*Daniel Perkins,Davis Hunter,Dhrumil Patel,Galen Flanagan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight ISLR model using pose estimation, segmentation, and ResNet-Transformer to handle signer variability with reduced computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM advances in translation exclude ASL users due to visual language complexity. ISLR faces challenges: scarce data, signer variability, and high computational costs.

Method: Three components: (1) pose estimation for hand/face joint coordinates, (2) segmentation module to isolate relevant information, (3) ResNet-Transformer backbone for spatial-temporal modeling.

Result: Proposed model reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation (specific metrics not provided in abstract).

Conclusion: The approach bridges accessibility gap for ASL users by addressing ISLR limitations with efficient, robust architecture.

Abstract: The recent surge in large language models has automated translations of spoken and written languages. However, these advances remain largely inaccessible to American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose language relies on complex visual cues. Isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) - the task of classifying videos of individual signs - can help bridge this gap but is currently limited by scarce per-sign data, high signer variability, and substantial computational costs. We propose a model for ISLR that reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation. Our approach integrates (i) a pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (ii) a segmentation module that isolates relevant information, and (iii) a ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.

### [48] [Visual-textual Dermatoglyphic Animal Biometrics: A First Case Study on Panthera tigris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14878)
*Wenshuo Li,Majid Mirmehdi,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to animal re-identification by combining visual data with dermatoglyphic textual descriptors, using tigers as a case study to demonstrate improved cross-modal retrieval and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for animal re-identification are largely image-based and limited to species with distinctive morphological features. The authors aim to overcome vision-only limitations by incorporating human-interpretable textual descriptors similar to those used in forensic dermatoglyphics, enabling better cross-modal identity retrieval and explainability.

Method: The researchers developed a visual-textual methodology using dermatoglyphic textual descriptors to encode animal coat topology. They analyzed 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers. To optimize performance, they created a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals' - dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text, addressing data scarcity issues.

Result: Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows that the dermatoglyphic text augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval. The approach enables textual-to-visual identity recovery with human-verifiable matchings, demonstrating novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval.

Conclusion: Dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations in animal re-identification, representing a significant advance toward explainability and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

### [49] [Vibe Spaces for Creatively Connecting and Expressing Visual Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14884)
*Huzheng Yang,Katherine Xu,Andrew Lu,Michael D. Grossberg,Yutong Bai,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vibe Blending creates visual concept hybrids by finding shared attributes between images using Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns geodesics in feature spaces for smooth transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to create meaningful visual concept hybrids because they can't identify nonlinear paths connecting distant concepts in latent space. The paper aims to enable coherent blending by discovering shared attributes ("vibe") between images.

Method: Proposes Vibe Space - a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces (like CLIP) to enable smooth, semantically consistent transitions between concepts. Also introduces a cognitive evaluation framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and geometric path-based difficulty scoring.

Result: Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods, demonstrating superior performance in generating meaningful visual concept hybrids.

Conclusion: The Vibe Space approach successfully addresses the challenge of creating coherent visual concept hybrids by learning geodesic paths in feature spaces, enabling meaningful connections between distant concepts through their shared attributes.

Abstract: Creating new visual concepts often requires connecting distinct ideas through their most relevant shared attributes -- their vibe. We introduce Vibe Blending, a novel task for generating coherent and meaningful hybrids that reveals these shared attributes between images. Achieving such blends is challenging for current methods, which struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths linking distant concepts in latent space. We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score. We find that Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods.

### [50] [PANDA-PLUS-Bench: A Clinical Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of AI Foundation Models in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14922)
*Joshua L. Ebbert,Dennis Della Corte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA-PLUS-Bench is a curated benchmark dataset for evaluating AI foundation models' robustness in prostate cancer Gleason grading, specifically testing whether models learn generalizable biological features vs. specimen-specific artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI foundation models for prostate cancer Gleason grading may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting their real-world clinical utility. There's a need to quantify this failure mode and evaluate model robustness.

Method: Created PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset with 9 whole slide images from 9 unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns. Extracted non-overlapping tissue patches at 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across 8 augmentation conditions. Evaluated 7 foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders.

Result: Substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 had lowest slide-level encoding (81.0%) but second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder (trained on prostate tissue) showed highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%). All models had within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps ranging from 19.9 to 26.9 percentage points.

Conclusion: PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in Gleason grading. Tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. The benchmark enables standardized evaluation of additional models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.

*Abhijeet Parida,Daniel Capellán-Martín,Zhifan Jiang,Nishad Kulkarni,Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Syed Muhammad Anwar,María J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive post-processing techniques improve glioma segmentation quality from large pre-trained models, enhancing performance in BraTS 2025 challenges while promoting computational fairness and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained models for glioma segmentation generalize poorly, produce systematic errors (false positives, label swaps, slice discontinuities), and have issues with GPU resource inequality and environmental costs of training.

Method: Proposed adaptive post-processing techniques to refine glioma segmentations from large-scale pre-trained models developed for various tumor types.

Result: Demonstrated in BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks: ranking metric improved by 14.9% for sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for adult glioma challenge.

Conclusion: Promotes shift from complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

*Zhenzhi Wang,Jian Wang,Ke Ma,Dahua Lin,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TalkVerse is a large-scale open corpus for audio-driven talking video generation with 2.3M high-resolution clips, plus a reproducible 5B DiT baseline model that achieves minute-long generation with low drift and 10× lower inference cost than comparable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art talking video generation systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, making fair comparison and reproducible research difficult. There's a need for open, large-scale datasets and efficient baseline models to advance the field.

Method: 1) Created TalkVerse dataset: 2.3M high-resolution clips curated from 60k+ hours via transparent pipeline with scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, audio-visual sync checks, and comprehensive annotations. 2) Built 5B DiT baseline on Wan2.2-5B with video VAE (high downsampling ratio) and sliding window mechanism for motion-frame context. 3) Integrated MLLM director for prompt rewriting based on audio/visual cues. 4) Implemented zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection.

Result: The model achieves minute-long generation with low drift, comparable lip-sync and visual quality to 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10× lower inference cost. Supports enhanced storytelling via MLLM director and zero-shot video dubbing.

Conclusion: TalkVerse provides a valuable open resource for fair comparison in audio-driven talking video generation. The 5B DiT baseline demonstrates efficient, high-quality generation capabilities. Open-sourcing dataset, training recipes, and checkpoints lowers barriers for research in this field.

Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

### [53] [Puzzle Curriculum GRPO for Vision-Centric Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14944)
*Ahmadreza Jeddi,Hakki Can Karaimer,Hue Nguyen,Zhongling Wang,Ke Zhao,Javad Rajabi,Ran Zhang,Raghav Goyal,Babak Taati,Radek Grzeszczuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-GRPO is a supervision-free RL method for VLMs that uses self-supervised puzzle environments instead of annotations, with difficulty-aware curriculum and consistency monitoring to improve visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for VLMs have three key issues: reliance on costly/noisy annotations or external verifiers, flat/sparse reward schemes in GRPO, and logical inconsistency between reasoning chains and final answers.

Method: PC-GRPO uses three self-supervised puzzle environments (PatchFit, Rotation, Jigsaw) with verifiable rewards, introduces difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples, and monitors Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training.

Result: PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy across diverse benchmarks on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, with RAC correlating with downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: PC-GRPO offers a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs without requiring annotations or external verifiers.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A trimodal person identification framework using voice, face, and gesture with cross-attention fusion and confidence weighting that maintains high accuracy even with missing modalities, achieving 99.18% on CANDOR dataset and 99.92% on VoxCeleb1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world person recognition systems often face missing or degraded modalities (audio, visual, behavioral cues), requiring robust solutions that can handle incomplete data.

Method: Multi-task learning for independent modality processing, cross-attention and gated fusion for modality interaction, and confidence-weighted fusion to dynamically adapt to missing/low-quality data.

Result: Achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on CANDOR dataset (new benchmark), 99.92% accuracy on VoxCeleb1 in bimodal mode, and maintains high performance even with one or two missing modalities.

Conclusion: The trimodal framework provides a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications by effectively handling modality loss through adaptive fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

*Maria Bulychev,Neil G. Marchant,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-hoc image watermarking method with localized embedding and region-level interpretability that reveals which image regions are watermarked or altered, achieving strong robustness while maintaining imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes with global detection scores, lacking transparency about where watermarks are present. This impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret tampering effects in the context of generative AI creating realistic digital content.

Method: Combines localized embedding with region-level interpretability by embedding watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy, generating detection maps that reveal watermarked or altered regions.

Result: Achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. Watermarks are highly imperceptible and robust to cropping up to half the image. Offers more interpretable detection than prior post-hoc methods while retaining competitive robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses the transparency limitations of existing watermarking schemes by providing interpretable region-level detection, enhancing user trust and enabling better understanding of watermark presence and tampering effects.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

*Sibi Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-based computer vision framework that distinguishes affiliative from agonistic livestock behaviors using anatomical keypoint trajectories instead of simple proximity thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current precision livestock farming approaches use static proximity thresholds that cannot differentiate between friendly and aggressive behaviors, limiting automated social network analysis in commercial barn environments.

Method: End-to-end pipeline with YOLOv11 for detection, supervised individual identification, ByteTrack for tracking, ZebraPose for 27-point keypoint estimation, and SVM classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics from keypoint trajectories.

Result: Achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative vs agonistic behaviors using pose information alone, with substantial improvement over proximity-only baselines, especially for affiliative interactions.

Conclusion: The framework provides proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based social interaction classification suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

*Huaying Zhang,Atsushi Hashimoto,Tosho Hirasawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation protocol for video question generation (VQG) that assesses question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from experts, using a question-to-answer retrieval approach on the novel EgoExoAsk dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQG evaluation focuses on answerability rather than question quality for extracting expert knowledge. There's a need for quantitative evaluation of what makes questions effective at eliciting unseen information from experts.

Method: Proposed a protocol that simulates expert communication using question-to-answer retrieval. Created EgoExoAsk dataset (27,666 QA pairs from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary) to train a retriever, then benchmarked on validation set with video segments.

Result: Experimental results show the metric aligns with VQG settings: models with richer context receive better evaluations, confirming the protocol works as intended for assessing question quality in eliciting expert knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation protocol and EgoExoAsk dataset enable better assessment of VQG models' ability to generate high-quality questions for extracting unseen knowledge from human experts, advancing beyond traditional answer-focused evaluation.

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference optimization methods in medical image segmentation are model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling, limiting their applicability and effectiveness.

Method: MAPO uses dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision, making it architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic (supports 2D/3D CNN and Transformer pipelines).

Result: MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training across diverse medical datasets.

Conclusion: MAPO provides a scalable, model-agnostic preference optimization framework that improves segmentation performance without direct ground-truth supervision.

Abstract: Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.

*Kaizhe Zhang,Shinan Chen,Qian Zhao,Weizhan Zhang,Caixia Yan,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVGSR is a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting super-resolution framework that integrates multi-view information using epipolar-constrained attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring sequential frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS SR methods have limitations: single-image SR networks lack cross-view consistency, while video-based approaches require sequential frames, making them unsuitable for unstructured multi-view datasets. There's a need for a method that can effectively integrate multi-view information for consistent, high-detail 3DGS rendering.

Method: 1) Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses for arbitrary multi-view datasets without temporal constraints. 2) Epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism that selectively aggregates consistent information from auxiliary views. 3) Multi-view SR network designed specifically for 3DGS representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks. The method produces high-frequency details with enhanced geometric consistency compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: MVGSR successfully addresses the limitations of previous 3DGS SR methods by providing a framework that integrates multi-view information effectively without requiring sequential frames, resulting in superior super-resolution quality and consistency for 3D Gaussian Splatting representations.

Abstract: Scenes reconstructed by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) trained on low-resolution (LR) images are unsuitable for high-resolution (HR) rendering. Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional high-speed camera methods for measuring high-frequency deformations in large structures are limited by harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs.

Method: Uses event camera with LED markers; filters observation noise based on event stream characteristics; differentiates between motion-induced events and LED blinking events; extracts LED markers from event stream; measures high-frequency planar deformations with monocular event camera.

Result: Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

Conclusion: The proposed event camera with LED markers method effectively measures high-frequency deformations, overcoming limitations of traditional high-speed camera approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical ultrasound videos have low contrast and noisy backgrounds causing missegmentation of organ boundaries, small object losses, and boundary errors. Object tracking in long videos remains challenging for computer-assisted surgery workflows.

Method: Encoder-decoder network with memory-based wavelet convolution to capture category/detailed information, cascaded wavelet compression for multiscale frequency fusion, LSTM bank with cross-attention for long video tracking, and HF-aware feature fusion with adaptive wavelet filters.

Result: Marked improvements in segmentation metrics on four ultrasound datasets (thyroid nodule, thyroid gland, heart) compared to SOTA methods, especially for small thyroid nodules in long videos.

Conclusion: MWNet effectively addresses ultrasound segmentation challenges by integrating wavelet filtering, memory mechanisms, and frequency-domain features, demonstrating superior performance for small object segmentation in long medical videos.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether commercial text-to-image models like Nano Banana Pro can serve as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision tasks, which remains underexplored despite their popularity.

Method: Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 low-level vision tasks spanning 40 datasets using simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, benchmarking against state-of-the-art specialist models.

Result: Performance dichotomy: Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality (hallucinating plausible high-frequency details) but lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: Nano Banana Pro is a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, but achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains challenging due to generative model stochasticity and pixel-level consistency requirements.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D animation pipelines are labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC approaches either inherit heavy 3D pipeline costs or sacrifice 3D controllability by relying on video synthesis. There's a fundamental trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control in single-image 3D animation generation.

Method: Proposes a lightweight framework using a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation: a coarse 3D estimate serves as structural carrier while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis, enabling 3D-aware motion control without accurate geometry or expensive optimization.

Result: The method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric/textural consistency, and precise interactive control. It naturally extends to coherent background animation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the quality-control trade-off in 3D animation by decoupling geometry and appearance, offering efficient, controllable animation generation comparable to classical pipelines without their computational burdens.

Abstract: 3D animation is central to modern visual media, yet traditional production pipelines remain labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.
  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.

*Shengxiao Zhou,Chenghua Li,Jianhao Huang,Qinghao Hu,Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE is a framework for reference-guided instance editing that disentangles intrinsic appearance from extrinsic attributes to enable precise borrowing of appearance features from references to targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-guided instance editing suffers from semantic entanglement where reference appearance is intertwined with extrinsic attributes, making it difficult to determine what to borrow from references and how to apply it appropriately to targets.

Method: GENIE uses three modules: 1) Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) to correct misalignments, 2) Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) to learn what to borrow by amplifying intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, and 3) Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) to learn how to render appearance onto targets while preserving structure.

Result: Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset show GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.

Conclusion: GENIE successfully addresses the semantic entanglement problem in reference-guided instance editing through explicit disentanglement, enabling more precise and effective borrowing of appearance features from references to targets.

Abstract: Reference-guided instance editing is fundamentally limited by semantic entanglement, where a reference's intrinsic appearance is intertwined with its extrinsic attributes. The key challenge lies in disentangling what information should be borrowed from the reference, and determining how to apply it appropriately to the target. To tackle this challenge, we propose GENIE, a Generalizable Instance Editing framework capable of achieving explicit disentanglement. GENIE first corrects spatial misalignments with a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM). Then, an Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) learns what to borrow by amplifying salient intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, while a Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) mechanism learns how to render this appearance onto the target, preserving its structure. Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset demonstrate that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.

TL;DR: A new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task with CoT-AFA dataset for evaluating action standardization, featuring fitness/martial arts videos with multi-level annotations and chain-of-thought explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods only identify what/where actions occur, lacking assessment of action standardization quality. Existing datasets lack labels for action standardization degree, and action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback.

Method: Define AFA task and create CoT-AFA dataset with fitness/martial arts videos featuring multi-level annotations. Introduce chain-of-thought explanation paradigm for complete reasoning process. Propose Explainable Fitness Assessor framework with parallel visual/semantic processing streams and dynamic gating mechanism.

Result: Method achieves +16.0% improvement in CIDEr for explanation generation, +2.7% in action classification accuracy, and +2.1% in quality assessment accuracy, demonstrating CoT-AFA's potential for future studies.

Conclusion: The AFA task and CoT-AFA dataset address limitations in current action assessment by providing explainable feedback on action standardization. The proposed framework effectively fuses visual and semantic information for comprehensive action analysis.

Abstract: Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

### [68] [EagleVision: A Dual-Stage Framework with BEV-grounding-based Chain-of-Thought for Spatial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15160)
*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Hang Zhang,Mu Xu,Yang Han,Hong Zhang,Ding Yuan,Yifan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EagleVision is a dual-stage framework for spatial reasoning that uses macro perception to select keyframes and micro verification for spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving SOTA on VSI-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial intelligence approaches have weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and untraceable evidence chains. Current "thinking with images" frameworks don't address key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought: global space perception under token budgets, explicit 3D hypothesis-frame association, and spatially grounded RL rewards.

Method: Dual-stage framework: 1) Macro perception uses SPF-DPP to select geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under fixed token budget; 2) Micro verification formalizes spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying - agent iteratively predicts poses on BEV plane, retrieves nearest real frames, trained purely by RL with spatial grounding reward.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VSI-Bench among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

Conclusion: EagleVision addresses key challenges in spatial reasoning through its dual-stage approach of efficient keyframe selection and BEV-grounded pose verification, enabling traceable spatial chain-of-thought with strong consistency.

Abstract: Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

TL;DR: CMUS-Net: A cross-modal ultra-scale learning network for multi-modal glomerular disease classification using TEM, OM, and IM images, addressing nanometer-to-micrometer scale differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal models struggle with feature fusion due to huge scale differences between nanoscale TEM images and microscale OM/IM images, limiting accurate glomerular disease classification.

Method: Proposes CMUS-Net with: 1) sparse multi-instance learning to aggregate TEM features, 2) cross-modal scale attention for feature interaction, and 3) multiple loss functions to weigh modality importance.

Result: Achieves 95.37% ACC, 99.05% AUC, and 95.32% F1-score on in-house dataset, outperforming other multi-modal/multi-scale methods and showing generalization in MN staging.

Conclusion: CMUS-Net effectively bridges nanometer-micrometer scale gaps for multi-modal glomerular disease classification, following clinical pathology workflow and enabling automated diagnosis of IgAN, MN, and LN.

Abstract: Constructing a multi-modal automatic classification model based on three types of renal biopsy images can assist pathologists in glomerular multi-disease identification. However, the substantial scale difference between transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image features at the nanoscale and optical microscopy (OM) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IM) images at the microscale poses a challenge for existing multi-modal and multi-scale models in achieving effective feature fusion and improving classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal ultra-scale learning network (CMUS-Net) for the auxiliary diagnosis of multiple glomerular diseases. CMUS-Net utilizes multiple ultrastructural information to bridge the scale difference between nanometer and micrometer images. Specifically, we introduce a sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate features from TEM images. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal scale attention module to facilitate feature interaction, enhancing pathological semantic information. Finally, multiple loss functions are combined, allowing the model to weigh the importance among different modalities and achieve precise classification of glomerular diseases. Our method follows the conventional process of renal biopsy pathology diagnosis and, for the first time, performs automatic classification of multiple glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (LN) based on images from three modalities and two scales. On an in-house dataset, CMUS-Net achieves an ACC of 95.37+/-2.41%, an AUC of 99.05+/-0.53%, and an F1-score of 95.32+/-2.41%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMUS-Net outperforms other well-known multi-modal or multi-scale methods and show its generalization capability in staging MN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety is paramount in automated driving, requiring accurate perception evaluation. While many performance metrics exist, safety-specific metrics are needed to distinguish relevant from non-relevant objects, which is addressed by criticality/relevance metrics.

Method: Comprehensive literature review to identify applicable criticality metrics, empirical validation using DeepAccident dataset with safety-critical scenarios, and proposal of two novel strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation.

Conclusion: This work provides the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation, with proposed strategies showing substantial improvements in accurately assessing object detection systems for automated driving safety.

Abstract: Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.

*Sarim Hashmi,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Mohammed Talha Alam,Samuele Poppi,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A resynthesis framework for deepfake detection that focuses on high-precision, low-recall verification with adversarial robustness against compute-restricted adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable due to: (i) inability to distinguish inauthentic content post-hoc (leading to unbounded false positive rates), and (ii) lack of robustness as adversaries can easily adapt to known detectors with minimal computational resources.

Method: Proposes a resynthesis framework to determine sample authenticity or plausibly deny authenticity. Uses calibrated resynthesis method focusing on high-precision, low-recall setting against compute-restricted adversaries. Leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques and supports multiple modalities.

Result: The calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low false positive rates. Achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed resynthesis framework addresses key limitations of current deepfake detection by providing reliable verification of authentic samples with controlled false positive rates and robust defense against computationally efficient adversaries.

Abstract: Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAW-based low-light enhancement methods have two main limitations: 1) They sequentially process multi-scale information, making it difficult to achieve lightweight models and high processing speeds; 2) They ignore the green channel superiority of RAW images, failing to leverage green channel information for better reconstruction.

Method: Proposes ERIENet with two key innovations: 1) Efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with channel-aware residual dense blocks to extract features with reduced computational costs; 2) Green channel guidance branch that exploits rich information within green channels of input RAW images to guide reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher efficiency. Achieves optimal speed of over 146 FPS for 4K-resolution images on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 with 24G memory.

Conclusion: ERIENet provides an efficient solution for RAW-based low-light image enhancement by addressing computational inefficiency and underutilization of green channel information, achieving both superior performance and real-time processing capability.

Abstract: RAW images have shown superior performance than sRGB images in many image processing tasks, especially for low-light image enhancement. However, most existing methods for RAW-based low-light enhancement usually sequentially process multi-scale information, which makes it difficult to achieve lightweight models and high processing speeds. Besides, they usually ignore the green channel superiority of RAW images, and fail to achieve better reconstruction performance with good use of green channel information. In this work, we propose an efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet), which parallelly processes multi-scale information with efficient convolution modules, and takes advantage of rich information in green channels to guide the reconstruction of images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with a novel channel-aware residual dense block to extract feature maps, which reduces computational costs and achieves real-time processing speed. Secondly, we introduce a green channel guidance branch to exploit the rich information within the green channels of the input RAW image. It increases the quality of reconstruction results with few parameters and computations. Experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets show that ERIENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher effiency. It also achieves an optimal speed of over 146 frame-per-second (FPS) for 4K-resolution images on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 with 24G memory.

*Yufeng Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric for infrared and visible image fusion in UAV reconnaissance, addressing the "Noise Trap" problem where traditional metrics incorrectly reward noisy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional no-reference metrics like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG) fail in complex low-light UAV reconnaissance environments because they misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail, creating a "Noise Trap" that paradoxically assigns higher scores to noisy images and misguides fusion algorithms.

Method: The authors propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric, inspired by Weber's Law, which focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC specifically penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility.

Result: Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude UAV reconnaissance scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed TBC metric effectively addresses the limitations of traditional no-reference metrics in low-light UAV environments by focusing on target-background contrast rather than being misled by sensor noise, providing a more reliable evaluation standard for infrared and visible image fusion.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion is a pivotal technology in low-altitude UAV reconnaissance missions, providing high-quality data support for downstream tasks such as target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with background texture details.However, traditional no-reference metrics fail(Specifically,like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG)) in complex low-light environments. They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a "Noise Trap," paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility.

TL;DR: Mesh-Plug: A plug-and-play module that transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates by estimating camera rotation from human-centered cues, eliminating dependency on environmental context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human mesh reconstruction methods assume zero camera rotation, which works in camera coordinates but causes significant errors when transforming to world coordinates. The lack of camera rotation information in in-the-wild images makes accurate world coordinate reconstruction challenging.

Method: Proposes Mesh-Plug with two key components: 1) Camera rotation prediction module that uses RGB images and depth maps rendered from initial mesh to estimate camera pitch angle by focusing on human body spatial configuration; 2) Mesh adjustment module that integrates predicted camera parameters with initial mesh to simultaneously refine root joint orientation and body pose.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

Conclusion: Mesh-Plug provides an effective solution for transforming human meshes from camera to world coordinates using human-centered camera rotation estimation, addressing a key limitation in current 3D human reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D human meshes in the world coordinate system from in-the-wild images remains challenging due to the lack of camera rotation information. While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares in complex real-world nighttime scenarios with diverse lighting conditions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: SLCFormer integrates two key modules: FFEM (Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module) for global contextual representations in frequency domain, and DESM (Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module) for local structural enhancement in spatial domain. Also introduces ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline for physically realistic training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Flare7K++ dataset, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, with robust generalization to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.

Conclusion: SLCFormer effectively addresses the challenge of nonuniform scattered flare removal in complex nighttime scenarios through its spectral-local transformer framework and physically-realistic training data generation, advancing the field of lens flare removal.

Abstract: Lens flare is a common nighttime artifact caused by strong light sources scattering within camera lenses, leading to hazy streaks, halos, and glare that degrade visual quality. However, existing methods usually fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares, which severely reduces their applicability to complex real-world scenarios with diverse lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose SLCFormer, a novel spectral-local context transformer framework for effective nighttime lens flare removal. SLCFormer integrates two key modules: the Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module (FFEM), which captures efficient global contextual representations in the frequency domain to model flare characteristics, and the Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module (DESM) for local structural enhancement and directional features in the spatial domain for precise flare removal. Furthermore, we introduce a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline to synthesize physically realistic scatter flares with spatially varying PSFs, bridging optical physics and data-driven training. Extensive experiments on the Flare7K++ dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, and generalizing robustly to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space, but fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces that can be leveraged for more efficient adaptation.

Method: Null-LoRA performs low-rank adaptation within the null space of pre-trained models by freezing portions of low-rank matrices to reduce redundancy and enhance effective rank. It constrains the entire incremental update within the null space to maximize utilization of incremental updates for new task adaptation.

Result: Null-LoRA surpasses state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: Null-space based adaptation provides an effective approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, achieving superior performance with reduced parameter requirements by leveraging the inherent null spaces of pre-trained models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have gained considerable popularity for adapting large-scale models to downstream tasks, particularly LoRA and its variants. Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms. Null-LoRA surpasses the state of the art with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: CMAC-MMD framework reduces intersectional bias in medical AI by standardizing diagnostic certainty across patient subgroups without needing demographic data during inference, improving both fairness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems exhibit intersectional biases where models are less confident in diagnosing marginalized patient subgroups, leading to inaccurate/missed diagnoses. Current fairness interventions often fail to address these gaps or compromise overall performance.

Method: Developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardizes diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference.

Result: In dermatology: reduced intersectional missed diagnosis gap (ΔTPR) from 0.50 to 0.26, improved AUC from 0.94 to 0.97. In glaucoma screening: reduced ΔTPR from 0.41 to 0.31, improved AUC from 0.71 to 0.72. Validated on large datasets (HAM10000, BCN20000, Harvard-FairVLMed).

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and equitable across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

*Kuinan Hou,Jing Mi,Marco Zorzi,Lamberto Ballan,Alberto Testolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs match or surpass specialized counting architectures for object enumeration, especially when prompted to generate intermediate object representations, but still struggle with complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counting approaches rely on domain-specific architectures trained on predefined object categories, while large-scale multimodal vision-language models offer potential as flexible alternatives for open-set object counting.

Method: Systematic comparison of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets and a novel benchmark with finer-grained visual property control.

Result: Most VLMs can approximately enumerate items in visual scenes, matching or surpassing specialized architectures. Accuracy significantly improves when VLMs generate intermediate representations (locations and verbal labels) of each object.

Conclusion: While VLMs show promise for open-set counting, none can reliably count objects in complex visual scenes, indicating need for further research to create AI systems that can deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

TL;DR: MMMamba: A cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening using Mamba architecture with multimodal interleaved scanning for efficient high-resolution multispectral image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based pan-sharpening methods have limitations in adapting to diverse spatial/spectral variations, while cross-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences. There's a need for more efficient and effective cross-modal fusion for generating high-resolution multispectral images.

Method: Proposes MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework built on Mamba architecture with linear computational complexity. Introduces novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism for effective information exchange between PAN and MS modalities. Supports zero-shot image super-resolution.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMMamba provides an efficient and effective solution for pan-sharpening with strong cross-modal interaction capacity, outperforming current methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

TL;DR: SynthSeg Agents is a multi-agent LLM framework that generates synthetic training data for zero-shot weakly supervised semantic segmentation without using any real images, achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods still rely on real-world training samples even when using generative models for data augmentation. The authors aim to eliminate this dependency entirely by creating a zero-shot approach that generates synthetic training data without any real image supervision, enabling more cost-efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.

Method: A two-agent framework: 1) Self-Refine Prompt Agent uses LLMs with iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration to create diverse semantic image prompts, guided by CLIP similarity and nearest-neighbor diversity filtering. 2) Image Generation Agent uses VLMs to synthesize candidate images from prompts, with CLIP scoring for quality selection and a ViT classifier for improved semantic relabeling of the synthetic dataset.

Result: The framework produces high-quality synthetic training data without real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show competitive performance compared to methods that use real training images, demonstrating the viability of zero-shot weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SynthSeg Agents successfully enables zero-shot weakly supervised semantic segmentation through LLM-driven synthetic data generation, highlighting the potential of multi-agent frameworks for cost-efficient and scalable semantic segmentation without real image dependencies.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations. While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images. SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images. This highlights the potential of LLM driven agents in enabling cost efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce sensor complexity and deployment costs for BEV segmentation in autonomous driving while maintaining competitive performance, addressing the limitations of expensive multi-sensor setups.

Method: Uses novel LiDAR image representation (range, intensity, ambient channels) with voxel-aligned view transformer for spatial fidelity. A high-capacity LiDAR-camera fusion Teacher network extracts spatial/semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network using only single 360° panoramic camera.

Result: Teacher model achieves 25.6% IoU improvement over existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods on Dur360BEV dataset. Distilled Student attains 8.5% IoU gain with state-of-the-art 31.2 FPS inference speed. Framework generalizes to diverse camera setups (KITTI-360 with fisheye cameras).

Conclusion: The approach provides practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in real-world autonomous driving by reducing sensor complexity while maintaining competitive performance through cross-modality distillation.

Abstract: We present the first cross-modality distillation framework specifically tailored for single-panoramic-camera Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation. Our approach leverages a novel LiDAR image representation fused from range, intensity and ambient channels, together with a voxel-aligned view transformer that preserves spatial fidelity while enabling efficient BEV processing. During training, a high-capacity LiDAR and camera fusion Teacher network extracts both rich spatial and semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network that relies solely on a single 360-degree panoramic camera image. Extensive experiments on the Dur360BEV dataset demonstrate that our teacher model significantly outperforms existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods, achieving a 25.6\% IoU improvement. Meanwhile, the distilled Student network attains competitive performance with an 8.5\% IoU gain and state-of-the-art inference speed of 31.2 FPS. Moreover, evaluations on KITTI-360 (two fisheye cameras) confirm that our distillation framework generalises to diverse camera setups, underscoring its feasibility and robustness. This approach reduces sensor complexity and deployment costs while providing a practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in real-world autonomous driving.

*Antony Jerald,Dattesh Shanbhag,Sudhanya Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoMAC-MRI is an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts in MRI across different contrasts and orientations using supervised contrastive learning and grade-specific affinity scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion artifacts degrade MRI quality and increase patient recalls, but existing automated quality assessment methods are limited to binary decisions with little interpretability.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning to learn discriminative representations of motion severity, then computes grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade for transparent grade assignment.

Result: Evaluated on 5000+ expert-annotated brain MRI slices across multiple contrasts and views; affinity scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as interpretable measures of motion severity.

Conclusion: AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control with accurate grade detection and interpretable per-grade affinity scoring, potentially reducing unnecessary rescans and improving workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCSNet improves few-shot anomaly detection by addressing domain gaps between pre-trained features and target scenarios using prototypical feature adaptation and context-aware segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot anomaly detection methods rely on pre-trained features but overlook domain gaps between these representations and target scenarios, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes PCSNet with two sub-networks: 1) Prototypical Feature Adaptation (PFA) extracts prototypical features for better normal data compactness and anomaly separation, using pixel-level disparity classification loss; 2) Context-Aware Segmentation (CAS) for pixel-level anomaly localization using pseudo anomalies for training.

Result: Achieves 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC on MVTec and MPDD datasets in 8-shot scenarios, and shows promising results in real-world automotive plastic part inspection with limited samples.

Conclusion: PCSNet effectively addresses domain gaps in few-shot anomaly detection, improving feature descriptiveness and achieving state-of-the-art performance with limited training samples across industrial inspection applications.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) denotes the identification of anomalies within a target category with a limited number of normal samples. Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

### [85] [A Masked Reverse Knowledge Distillation Method Incorporating Global and Local Information for Image Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15326)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Can,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRKD introduces masked reverse knowledge distillation with image-level and feature-level masking to address overgeneralization in anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation for anomaly detection suffers from overgeneralization due to similarities between input and supervisory signals, limiting its effectiveness in distinguishing normal from abnormal patterns.

Method: Proposes Masked Reverse Knowledge Distillation (MRKD) with two key components: Image-Level Masking (ILM) to capture global information by differentiating input signals, and Feature-Level Masking (FLM) that incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to preserve local information. This transforms image reconstruction into image restoration.

Result: Achieves impressive performance on MVTec dataset: 98.9% image-level AU-ROC, 98.4% pixel-level AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. Extensive ablation studies validate MRKD's superiority in mitigating overgeneralization.

Conclusion: MRKD effectively addresses the overgeneralization problem in knowledge distillation for anomaly detection through innovative masking strategies, demonstrating strong context capture capacity and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.

*Parvesh Saini,Soumyadipta Maiti,Beena Rai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision system that reads measurements from linear scales (syringes and measuring cylinders) by mimicking human-like visual analysis, achieving accuracy comparable to human readings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vision models excel at tasks like object detection and classification, few can perform accurate quantitative measurements from images like humans do. For laboratory robots to achieve full autonomy, they need to read measurements from instruments as humans would in unstructured environments.

Method: The system corrects orientation of randomly positioned instruments, isolates the linear scale region, extracts key features (major markers, corresponding digits, level indicator location), and calculates final readings from these features.

Result: The system's readings showed accurate correspondence with human-read values for the same syringe and measuring cylinder instances, demonstrating reliable measurement extraction.

Conclusion: The human-inspired approach successfully enables robots to read linear scale measurements with human-like accuracy, advancing autonomous laboratory capabilities.

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

*Junjie Chen,Fei Wang,Zhihao Huang,Qing Zhou,Kun Li,Dan Guo,Linfeng Zhang,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIMAR is a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts using turn-level masked autoregression and diffusion to predict continuous head dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for 3D conversational modeling often treat talking and listening as independent processes or use non-causal full-sequence modeling, which hinders temporal coherence across conversational turns and fails to capture the bidirectional dynamics of real human conversation.

Method: TIMAR uses turn-level interleaved masked autoregression to model dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn, applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, and uses a lightweight diffusion head to predict continuous 3D head dynamics that capture both coordination and expressive variability.

Result: Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: TIMAR provides an effective causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that better captures the bidirectional dynamics of human conversation while maintaining temporal coherence across turns, with significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

TL;DR: Pro-GRPO improves Group Relative Policy Optimization by dynamically pruning low-variance trajectories during sampling, reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness through an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's effectiveness is limited by the computational cost of large group sizes, creating a conflict between optimization quality and practical feasibility.

Method: Pro-GRPO integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into sampling, using early termination for reward-clustered trajectories and an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy with multi-step Optimal Variance Filtering on latents.

Result: Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead while outperforming static OVF approaches, demonstrating effectiveness on both diffusion-based and flow-based models.

Conclusion: Pro-GRPO provides an efficient dynamic framework that resolves GRPO's computational bottleneck through proactive trajectory pruning, enabling better alignment of generative models.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses critical need in infrastructure inspection and maintenance by enabling accurate automated segmentation of bridge components for structural health monitoring.

Method: Created a specialized dataset of high-resolution 3D scans of diverse bridge structures with detailed semantic labels, then evaluated three state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures and analyzed domain gaps from different sensors.

Result: All tested architectures demonstrated robust performance on bridge segmentation, but sensor variations caused domain gaps that could reduce performance by up to 11.4% mIoU.

Conclusion: The dataset enables advancement in bridge inspection automation, but sensor-induced domain gaps must be addressed for reliable real-world deployment of 3D semantic segmentation models.

Abstract: We propose a novel dataset that has been specifically designed for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges and the domain gap analysis caused by varying sensors. This addresses a critical need in the field of infrastructure inspection and maintenance, which is essential for modern society. The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, we present data acquired through diverse sensors to quantify the domain gap resulting from sensor variations. Our findings indicate that all architectures demonstrate robust performance on the specified task. However, the domain gap can potentially lead to a decline in the performance of up to 11.4% mIoU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses emotion recognition in sign language by tackling two challenges: overlap between grammatical/affective facial expressions and data scarcity, using cross-lingual datasets (eJSL for Japanese and BOBSL for British Sign Language).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two main challenges in signer emotion recognition: 1) theoretical challenge of distinguishing grammatical vs. affective facial expressions, and 2) practical challenge of limited training data availability for sign language emotion recognition models.

Method: Uses cross-lingual approach with new eJSL dataset (Japanese Sign Language, 1,092 clips) and BOBSL dataset (British Sign Language). Explores textual emotion recognition from spoken language subtitles, temporal segment selection, and incorporation of hand motion features.

Result: Shows that: 1) textual emotion recognition from spoken language helps mitigate sign language data scarcity, 2) temporal segment selection significantly impacts performance, and 3) hand motion features enhance emotion recognition accuracy. Establishes stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual approach effectively addresses sign language emotion recognition challenges, with textual emotion transfer, temporal modeling, and hand motion integration proving crucial for improved performance over existing spoken language baselines.

Abstract: Recognition of signers' emotions suffers from one theoretical challenge and one practical challenge, namely, the overlap between grammatical and affective facial expressions and the scarcity of data for model training. This paper addresses these two challenges in a cross-lingual setting using our eJSL dataset, a new benchmark dataset for emotion recognition in Japanese Sign Language signers, and BOBSL, a large British Sign Language dataset with subtitles. In eJSL, two signers expressed 78 distinct utterances with each of seven different emotional states, resulting in 1,092 video clips. We empirically demonstrate that 1) textual emotion recognition in spoken language mitigates data scarcity in sign language, 2) temporal segment selection has a significant impact, and 3) incorporating hand motion enhances emotion recognition in signers. Finally we establish a stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

TL;DR: Introduces action anticipation in basketball videos for predicting which team gains possession after a shot attempt, with a new dataset of 100K clips and baseline deep learning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While computer vision has advanced sports analytics with tracking and action recognition, anticipating future actions in sports videos remains under-explored. Basketball rebound prediction is particularly challenging and valuable for real-time applications.

Method: Created a new self-curated dataset of 100,000 basketball video clips (300+ hours) with 2,000+ manually annotated rebound events. Applied state-of-the-art action anticipation methods for baseline results, and explored complementary tasks of rebound classification and spotting.

Result: First application of deep learning to basketball rebound prediction, demonstrating both feasibility and challenges. The dataset supports multiple video understanding applications in basketball where no comparable datasets exist.

Conclusion: Action anticipation in basketball videos is a valuable but challenging task. The new dataset enables predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios, with applications in real-time broadcasting and post-game analysis tools.

Abstract: Computer vision and video understanding have transformed sports analytics by enabling large-scale, automated analysis of game dynamics from broadcast footage. Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMART is a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model for Partially View-aligned Clustering that addresses distributional shifts in multi-view data to better exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data often has both aligned and unaligned views, but existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture shared semantics. Distributional shifts in multi-view representations cause inaccurate correspondences between cross-view features, impairing learning effectiveness.

Method: Proposes SMART model that alleviates cross-view distributional shifts to facilitate semantic matching contrastive learning. The approach enables better exploitation of semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data through improved correspondence learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that SMART consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

Conclusion: SMART effectively addresses the challenges of partially view-aligned clustering by mitigating distributional shifts and enabling better semantic matching, leading to improved clustering performance with both aligned and unaligned multi-view data.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has been empirically shown to improve learning performance by leveraging the inherent complementary information across multiple views of data. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight channel-independent architectures outperform deep early-fusion CNNs for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex tissue imaging by better preserving marker-specific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning models use early channel fusion for multiplex tissue imaging, assuming shared structure across markers, but this may not be optimal for preserving marker-specific information needed for rare-cell discrimination.

Method: Proposed Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with only 5.5K parameters that preserves marker independence, compared against standard early-fusion CNNs and channel-separated architectures using contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation on Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers.

Result: Channel-independent architectures, especially CIM-S, achieve substantially stronger representations than early-fusion models despite compact size, better retain marker-specific information, and excel at rare-cell discrimination, consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks and augmentation settings.

Conclusion: Lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning, offering a more suitable inductive bias than increasing model scale.

Abstract: Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization but have a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs (3D Mirage). This creates an unquantified safety risk that needs to be addressed.

Method: 1) 3D-Mirage benchmark with real-world illusions and planar-region annotations; 2) Laplacian-based evaluation framework with Deviation Composite Score (DCS) and Confusion Composite Score (CCS); 3) Grounded Self-Distillation - parameter-efficient strategy enforcing planarity on illusion ROIs while preserving background knowledge.

Result: The paper provides essential tools to diagnose and mitigate the 3D Mirage phenomenon, including the first benchmark for real-world illusions, quantitative evaluation metrics, and a surgical mitigation approach that avoids catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The work urges a necessary shift in monocular depth estimation evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness, providing tools to foster research in this direction.

Abstract: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.

Motivation: Vision-text compression (VTC) achieves 3x-20x token compression for LLMs but its impact on VLMs' long-context capabilities is under-investigated. The paper aims to address this gap by creating systematic benchmarks.

Method: Introduced VTC benchmark with three settings: VTC-Retrieval (information retrieval/aggregation), VTC-Reasoning (inferring latent associations with minimal lexical overlap), and VTC-Memory (comprehensive QA within long-term dialogue memory). Also created VTCBench-Wild for diverse input scenarios.

Result: Most VLMs exhibit surprisingly poor long-context understanding with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies despite good OCR decoding capabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides deep understanding of VTC and serves as foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs, highlighting the need for improved long-context handling in compressed visual representations.

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

TL;DR: Self-evolving GUI agent training pipeline with calibrated rewards produces high-quality data at low cost, resulting in state-of-the-art Step-GUI models, standardized GUI-MCP protocol for privacy, and AndroidDaily benchmark for real-world evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs enable GUI automation but face challenges in acquiring high-quality training data with reliable annotations at reasonable cost. Practical deployment also needs standardized interfaces across devices while protecting user privacy.

Method: 1) Self-evolving training pipeline with Calibrated Step Reward System that converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals via trajectory-level calibration. 2) Step-GUI model family (4B/8B). 3) GUI-MCP protocol with hierarchical architecture combining low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation. 4) AndroidDaily benchmark with real-world mobile usage patterns.

Result: >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost; Step-GUI 8B achieves SOTA: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro; GUI-MCP enables high-privacy on-device execution; AndroidDaily benchmark shows 8B model achieves 89.91% static and 52.50% end-to-end task performance.

Conclusion: The work advances practical GUI agent development with efficient training, standardized privacy-preserving interfaces, and real-world evaluation, demonstrating strong potential for deployment in everyday digital interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

### [97] [CLIP-FTI: Fine-Grained Face Template Inversion via CLIP-Driven Attribute Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15433)
*Longchen Dai,Zixuan Shen,Zhiheng Zhou,Peipeng Yu,Zhihua Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-FTI: A CLIP-driven framework for face template inversion that uses semantic embeddings of facial features to reconstruct photorealistic faces from leaked templates with improved attribute fidelity and cross-model transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leaked face templates pose serious privacy and security threats as they can be inverted to create photorealistic surrogates for impersonation. Existing inversion methods produce over-smoothed facial features with limited transferability between different recognition systems.

Method: Uses CLIP model to extract semantic embeddings of facial features, fuses them with leaked templates via cross-modal feature interaction network, and projects into StyleGAN's latent space to synthesize identity-preserving faces with fine-grained attribute details.

Result: Achieves higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, recovers sharper component-level attribute semantics, and improves cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets.

Conclusion: CLIP-FTI is the first method to use additional information beyond face templates for inversion, achieving state-of-the-art results in reconstructing photorealistic faces with fine-grained facial attributes from leaked templates.

Abstract: Face recognition systems store face templates for efficient matching. Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.

*Yueqianji Chen,Kevin Williams,John H. Doonan,Paolo Remagnino,Jo Hepworth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-DETrack is a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network that achieves 93.6% branch matching accuracy for automated plant branch tracking from budding to flowering, outperforming baselines by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies, requiring solutions to overcome stage-dependent ambiguities.

Method: ST-DETrack integrates a spatial decoder (using geometric priors like position and angle for early-stage tracking) with a temporal decoder (exploiting motion consistency for late-stage occlusions), plus an adaptive gating mechanism and biological constraint based on negative gravitropism.

Result: Achieves 93.6% Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) on Brassica napus dataset, outperforming spatial baselines by 28.9 percentage points and temporal baselines by 3.3 percentage points.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures through adaptive spatiotemporal fusion and biological constraints.

Abstract: Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is essential for high-throughput phenotyping, yet it remains computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies. To overcome these stage-dependent ambiguities, we propose ST-DETrack, a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network designed to preserve branch identity from budding to flowering. Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate the method's robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures.

*Malach Obisa Amonga,Benard Osero,Edna Too*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResNet-101 and Inception v3 achieve high accuracy (94-95%) for wildlife detection but struggle with visually similar species and poor conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildlife object detection is crucial for biodiversity conservation but faces challenges from environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity.

Method: Used ResNet-101 and Inception v3 architectures trained on wildlife images with standardized preprocessing (resizing to 800px max, RGB conversion, PyTorch tensors) and 70:30 train-validation split.

Result: ResNet-101 achieved 94% accuracy and 0.91 mAP; Inception v3 performed slightly better with 95% accuracy and 0.92 mAP. Both struggled with visually similar species and poor lighting/occlusion conditions.

Conclusion: Both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective for wildlife object detection and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications, despite challenges with similar species and difficult conditions.

Abstract: Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.

### [100] [RUMPL: Ray-Based Transformers for Universal Multi-View 2D to 3D Human Pose Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15488)
*Seyed Abolfazl Ghasemzadeh,Alexandre Alahi,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUMPL is a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that uses a novel 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints, making it camera calibration-independent and view-agnostic for universal multi-view deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D pose estimation faces generalization challenges due to scarce real-world multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth. Existing methods struggle with constrained conditions and require camera calibration, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter using 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This representation eliminates camera calibration dependency and works with arbitrary view counts. Includes View Fusion Transformer for multi-view consistency through learned fused-ray tokens.

Result: Reduces MPJPE by up to 53% vs triangulation and over 60% vs transformer-based image-representation baselines. Shows robustness on in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirming scalability.

Conclusion: RUMPL provides a universal, calibration-free solution for multi-view 3D pose estimation that generalizes well to real-world scenarios without retraining, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

*Rohit Jena,Pratik Chaudhari,James C. Gee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning methods for MRI registration show good in-distribution performance but fail at zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts/resolutions, contradicting claims of universal superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To independently re-evaluate claims from the LUMIR challenge about deep learning methods achieving exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen MRI contrasts and resolutions, which contradicts established understanding of domain shift in deep learning.

Method: Performed rigorous independent re-evaluation using established evaluation protocols while addressing potential instrumentation bias, testing deep learning methods on various MRI contrasts (T1, T2, T2*, FLAIR) and resolutions.

Result: (1) Deep learning performs comparably to iterative methods on in-distribution T1w images and macaque data; (2) Significant performance degradation on out-of-distribution contrasts (Cohen's d 0.7-1.5); (3) Scalability limitations on high-resolution data (fails on 0.6mm isotropic); (4) High sensitivity to preprocessing choices.

Conclusion: Claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny; evaluation protocols should reflect practical clinical/research workflows rather than conditions favoring specific method classes, aligning with established domain shift literature.

Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting architecture that uses adaptive sub-pixel primitive detection instead of rigid pixel grids, achieving SOTA novel view synthesis with fewer primitives and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting models suffer from suboptimal primitive placement due to reliance on dense, rigid pixel grids, which limits both quality and efficiency in scene generation.

Method: Introduces an "Off The Grid" distribution approach using multi-resolution decoder for sub-pixel primitive detection, trained end-to-end with 3D reconstruction backbone via self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models, generating photorealistic scenes in seconds with far fewer primitives, better detail capture, and reduced artifacts. Also improves camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: The adaptive primitive placement approach enables more accurate and efficient 3D scene generation, and demonstrates potential for training foundational models without labels through improved pose estimation.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.

*Opeyemi Bamigbade,Mark Scanlon,John Sheppard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAAS is a new forensic framework that combines Vision Transformers and SegFormer embeddings to detect and quantify image manipulations with interpretable anomaly scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated forgeries are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evade traditional detection methods. Existing approaches lack explicit anomaly intensity measurement and interpretability for forensic investigations.

Method: Dual-module framework integrating global attention-based anomaly estimation with Vision Transformers and patch-level self-consistency scoring using SegFormer embeddings.

Result: Competitive F1 and IoU performance on DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets, with enhanced visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps.

Conclusion: VAAS bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment for forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.

*Yuxiang Shi,Zhe Li,Yanwen Wang,Hao Zhu,Xun Cao,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeX-Portrait is a diffusion-based method for portrait animation that achieves disentangled control of head pose and facial expression from a single source image and driving video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based portrait animation methods lack high-fidelity disentangled control between head pose and facial expression, which limits applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation.

Method: 1) Represent pose as explicit global transformation and expression as implicit latent code; 2) Design motion trainer to learn pose and expression encoders; 3) Inject pose through dual-branch conditioning and expression through cross attention; 4) Use progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for identity consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

Conclusion: DeX-Portrait successfully achieves expressive portrait animation with disentangled pose and expression control, enabling more flexible editing applications.

Abstract: Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Can Ma. Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoCaliber is a confidence-aware Multimodal Large Language Model for Visual Emotion Comprehension that verbalizes confidence in emotion predictions to address the subjectivity of emotion perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for Visual Emotion Comprehension treat emotion prediction as deterministic, requiring a single definitive label. This fails to account for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception and overlooks alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers.

Method: A three-stage training framework that: 1) progressively endows MLLMs with structured reasoning, 2) teaches them to verbalize confidence in predictions, and 3) calibrates confidence expression. This results in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC.

Result: EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods on the VECBench benchmark in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation, validating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed confidence-aware approach marks a feasible step toward more reliable Visual Emotion Comprehension systems by accounting for emotion perception subjectivity and providing users with estimates of alternative interpretations and model self-assessed competence.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.

TL;DR: GeoMELT is a compact encoder-only transformer model for multi-task learning in remote sensing, handling both text generation from images and cross-modal retrieval efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs for remote sensing are computationally expensive to train and use due to large parameter counts, making them inaccessible to most institutions. There's a need for efficient multi-task models that can handle both text generation and retrieval tasks.

Method: Proposes GeoMELT (Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer), an encoder-only architecture that addresses multiple remote sensing tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval in a unified, parameter-efficient model.

Result: GeoMELT demonstrates efficacy and efficiency in established benchmarks, confirming that compact encoder-only models can effectively handle multiple remote sensing tasks while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Encoder-only architectures like GeoMELT provide a viable, efficient alternative to large LVLMs for multi-task learning in remote sensing, making advanced vision-language capabilities more accessible to institutions with limited computational resources.

Abstract: The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: BLANKET is a novel two-stage method for anonymizing infant faces in videos while preserving facial attributes, outperforming DeepPrivacy2 on de-identification, attribute preservation, pose estimation impact, and artifact reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical use of video data with human subjects (especially infants) requires robust anonymization that protects privacy while preserving essential facial attributes for research purposes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate compatible random face via diffusion model inpainting, 2) Temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer across video frames.

Result: BLANKET outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in de-identification, facial attribute preservation, impact on human pose estimation (downstream task), and artifact reduction. Both methods successfully alter identity.

Conclusion: BLANKET provides effective infant face anonymization while maintaining facial attributes, offering a practical solution for ethical video data use with code available as an easy-to-use demo.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects.

TL;DR: GRAN-TED introduces a new paradigm for text encoders in diffusion models with TED-6K benchmark and a two-stage training method for superior text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text encoders are crucial for semantic fidelity in text-to-image/video diffusion models, but face challenges: lack of efficient evaluation frameworks and difficulty adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis.

Method: Two contributions: 1) TED-6K text-only benchmark with lightweight unified adapter for efficient encoder evaluation; 2) Two-stage training: fine-tuning on Multimodal LLM for visual representation, then layer-wise weighting for nuanced text features.

Result: TED-6K performance strongly correlates with downstream generation effectiveness. GRAN-TED encoder achieves SOTA on TED-6K and demonstrates performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks.

Conclusion: GRAN-TED provides a robust framework for developing and evaluating text encoders for diffusion models, addressing key challenges in text-to-visual generation with measurable improvements.

Abstract: The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

### [109] [On the Effectiveness of Textual Prompting with Lightweight Fine-Tuning for SAM3 Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15564)
*Roni Blushtein-Livnon,Osher Rafaeli,David Ioffe,Amir Boger,Karen Sandberg Esquenazi,Tal Svoray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM3 framework for remote sensing image segmentation shows that combining semantic (textual) and geometric cues yields best performance, with text-only prompting performing poorly due to semantic alignment issues between overhead imagery and natural images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image segmentation faces challenges due to limited annotated data and domain gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models, motivating effective adaptation under limited supervision.

Method: Evaluated SAM3 concept-driven framework for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference.

Result: Combining semantic and geometric cues yields highest performance. Text-only prompting exhibits lowest performance, especially for irregularly shaped targets. Light fine-tuning offers practical performance-effort trade-off for regular targets. Modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation.

Conclusion: Hybrid prompting with semantic and geometric cues works best for RS segmentation. Under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent errors, especially for irregular targets. Limited supervision (light fine-tuning) provides good adaptation with reasonable effort.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

*Zhipeng Du,Duolikun Danier,Jan Eric Lenssen,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoonSeg3R enables online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation using geometric priors from CUT3R, achieving competitive performance with RGB-D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods rely on posed RGB-D sequences, failing in practical monocular settings where only single RGB streams are available.

Method: Three key components: (1) self-supervised query refinement with spatial-semantic distillation to transform 2D VFM masks into 3D queries; (2) 3D query index memory for temporal consistency; (3) state-distribution token from CUT3R as mask identity descriptor for cross-frame fusion.

Result: First method enabling online monocular 3D segmentation, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems on ScanNet200 and SceneNN datasets.

Conclusion: MoonSeg3R successfully overcomes the RGB-D dependency limitation and enables practical online monocular 3D instance segmentation with zero-shot capability.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems. Code and models will be released.

*Shashank Mishra,Karan Patil,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMKD introduces a multi-level knowledge distillation framework for radar-camera 3D object detection that preserves sensor characteristics while enhancing complementary strengths through intensity-aware distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods for radar-camera fusion directly transfer modality-specific features, which distorts each sensor's unique characteristics and degrades their individual strengths, limiting performance.

Method: Three-stage intensity-aware distillation: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation for structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused intensity-guided distillation for geometry/depth information, (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion for feature alignment and calibration.

Result: Achieves 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP on nuScenes benchmark, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

Conclusion: IMKD effectively preserves sensor characteristics while amplifying complementary strengths through multi-level intensity-aware distillation, enabling high-performance radar-camera 3D detection without LiDAR at inference.

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/dfki-av/IMKD/.

TL;DR: FlexAvatar creates complete 3D head avatars from single images by combining monocular and multi-view training through transformer architecture with bias sinks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incomplete 3D head reconstructions from single images due to limited multi-view data and entanglement issues in monocular training.

Method: Transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens (bias sinks) that enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets.

Result: Generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations, outperforming existing methods in view extrapolation and achieving smooth latent avatar space for identity interpolation.

Conclusion: FlexAvatar successfully addresses the completeness problem in single-image 3D avatar creation by leveraging both monocular and multi-view data through a unified transformer architecture.

Abstract: We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: https://tobias-kirschstein.github.io/flexavatar/

TL;DR: Qwen-Image-Layered is a diffusion model that decomposes RGB images into multiple RGBA layers for independent editing, addressing consistency issues in image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual generative models struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, while professional design tools use layered representations for isolated edits.

Method: Three key components: (1) RGBA-VAE for unified latent representations, (2) VLD-MMDiT architecture for variable-layer decomposition, (3) Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt pretrained models. Also built a pipeline to extract multilayer images from PSD files for training data.

Result: The method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image-Layered enables inherent editability through semantic layer decomposition, providing a professional design-like workflow for consistent image manipulation.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

*Johannes Hägerlind,Bao-Long Tran,Urs Waldmann,Per-Erik Forssén*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust method for camera pose estimation and calibration that improves SfM pipelines through better correspondence subsampling and incremental view selection, particularly effective for cameras with strong radial distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SfM has improved camera calibration accuracy, challenges remain, especially for multi-camera setups used in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage where robust pose estimation is needed.

Method: Analyzes SfM pipeline components and introduces two improvements: (1) optimal subsampling of dense matcher correspondences for better estimation, and (2) criteria for incremental view addition. Also demonstrates correspondence subsampling in global SfM initialized with VGGT.

Result: Significant improvement over vanilla VGGT, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% vs 40.4%). The pipeline generalizes across diverse camera setups and could be useful for animal behavior and forensic applications.

Conclusion: The proposed robust method for pose estimation and calibration effectively addresses SfM challenges through improved correspondence handling and view selection, making it a valuable tool for specialized applications requiring multi-camera calibration.

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

*Morgan Coe,Gruffudd Jones,Leah-Nani Alconcel,Marina Gashinova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a feature tracking method for satellite recognition using sub-THz ISAR imaging, employing Hough transform and gradient-based edge detection to improve feature detection confidence in space domain awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing space debris and satellites, better Space Domain Awareness (SDA) is needed. Space-based sensing can inspect resident space objects (RSOs) at close ranges without atmospheric interference, requiring improved feature recognition methods.

Method: Uses sequential feature detection and tracking in aligned ISAR images: 1) Metaheuristic simulator generates ISAR imagery, 2) Affine transformations align frames, 3) Gradient-by-ratio method detects edges, 4) Double-weighted Hough transform identifies linear features, 5) Features are tracked across image sequences.

Result: The approach increases confidence in feature detection and classification. Demonstrated robust detection of shadowing as a feature, showing that feature tracking throughout sequences improves recognition of external satellite structures.

Conclusion: Sequential feature tracking in ISAR images enhances satellite structure recognition for Space Domain Awareness, providing more reliable detection and classification of external features through temporal analysis of feature evolution.

Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.

*Yu Zheng,Jie Hu,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP) framework for autonomous driving that handles reactive forecasting (what will happen) and proactive forecasting (what would happen given specific actions), with a new benchmark and OccSTeP-WM model achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving needs persistent 3D scene understanding robust to temporal disturbances and capable of accounting for future actions. Current approaches lack robustness to challenging scenarios like erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames.

Method: Proposes OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model with dense voxel-based scene state that incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context. Uses linear-complexity attention backbone and recurrent state-space module for long-range spatial dependencies with ego-motion compensation, enabling online inference even with missing/noisy historical input.

Result: Achieves average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain) on the new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios. Model shows robust performance when historical sensor input is missing or noisy.

Conclusion: The OccSTeP concept and OccSTeP-WM model effectively address 4D occupancy spatio-temporal persistence for autonomous driving, providing robust scene understanding for both reactive and proactive forecasting tasks. The framework will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

### [117] [Towards Physically-Based Sky-Modeling For Image Based Lighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15632)
*Ian J. Maquignaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AllSky is a new sky-model that learns from physically captured HDR imagery to generate realistic environment maps with full dynamic range, outperforming existing DNN-based methods in photorealism and illumination accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sky-models fail to faithfully recreate natural skies and cannot support both photorealism and the full 22 f-stops dynamic range required for outdoor illumination. Current DNN-generated environment maps don't re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery.

Method: AllSky is a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI. The authors study input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models, allowing intuitive user control over sun positioning and cloud formations.

Result: AllSky achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance, expands current functionality with intuitive user control over environment maps, and demonstrates that existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models.

Conclusion: Current limitations in DNN sky-models are prohibitive for scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications. AllSky represents progress in sky-modelling by addressing the gap between DNN-generated imagery and physically captured HDR for realistic outdoor scene rendering.

Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component for rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications

TL;DR: IC-Effect is a DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects while preserving spatial and temporal consistency using instruction guidance and contextual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video VFX editing is challenging because effects must blend seamlessly with unchanged backgrounds, and effect patterns must be learned from limited paired data. Existing video editing models fail to meet these requirements for precise background preservation and natural effect injection.

Method: IC-Effect leverages source video as clean contextual conditions using DiT's contextual learning capability. It uses a two-stage training strategy: general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA. Also introduces spatiotemporal sparse tokenization for computational efficiency.

Result: The method delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing. The authors also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning 15 high-quality visual styles.

Conclusion: IC-Effect opens new possibilities for video creation by enabling efficient, high-fidelity VFX editing with strict background preservation and temporal consistency from limited training data.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InpaintDPO: A DPO-based framework for foreground-conditioned inpainting that addresses spatial relationship hallucinations between foreground subjects and generated backgrounds through specialized optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foreground-conditioned inpainting methods suffer from Spatial Relationship Hallucinations (inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints between foreground and background). The subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it difficult to quantify, preventing the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods.

Method: Proposes InpaintDPO framework with three key components: 1) MaskDPO - confines preference optimization to background regions to avoid gradient conflicts; 2) Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization - uses differentiated cropping operations and global preference optimization for boundary coherence; 3) Shared Commonality Preference Optimization - leverages common spatial relationships across winning samples to enhance spatial rationality understanding.

Result: The framework ensures plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements, enhances boundary coherence, and promotes shared spatial rationality across high-quality samples.

Conclusion: InpaintDPO successfully addresses spatial relationship hallucinations in foreground-conditioned inpainting through novel DPO-based optimization techniques that handle the subjective nature of spatial rationality while preserving foreground integrity and improving boundary coherence.

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.

### [120] [Hard Labels In! Rethinking the Role of Hard Labels in Mitigating Local Semantic Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15647)
*Jiacheng Cui,Bingkui Tong,Xinyue Bi,Xiaohan Zhao,Jiacheng Liu,Zhiqiang shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft labels from teacher models can cause local semantic drift when using few crops per image, where crops resemble wrong classes. Hard labels provide content-agnostic anchors to correct this drift. HALD combines soft and hard labels for better alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft labels from teacher models are widely used for knowledge transfer but suffer from local semantic drift when only limited crops per image are used. This drift occurs when crops visually resemble other classes, causing soft embeddings to deviate from ground-truth semantics, leading to training-testing distribution misalignment.

Method: Proposes HALD (Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift), a training paradigm that leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Theoretically characterizes drift emergence under few soft-label supervision and shows hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment.

Result: Achieves 42.7% on ImageNet-1K with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks show consistent improvements in generalization.

Conclusion: Hard labels serve as powerful content-agnostic anchors to calibrate semantic drift in soft-label-dominated training. The findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as complementary tools and call for rethinking their role in modern training paradigms.

Abstract: Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.

*Georg Siedel,Rojan Regmi,Abhirami Anand,Weijia Shao,Silvia Vock,Andrey Morozov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes combining synthetic image data with neural style transfer to improve deep vision models' robustness against common corruptions, achieving state-of-the-art results on corruption benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions by enhancing training data augmentation techniques.

Method: Training data augmentation pipeline combining synthetic image data with neural style transfer, systematically analyzing augmentation effects and hyperparameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness: 93.54% on CIFAR-10-C, 74.9% on CIFAR-100-C, and 50.86% on TinyImageNet-C.

Conclusion: Stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based augmentations like TrivialAugment, significantly improving model robustness to corruptions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skyra is a multimodal LLM that detects AI-generated videos by identifying visual artifacts and providing human-interpretable explanations, outperforming existing binary classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated video misuse creates social concerns, but current detectors only do binary classification without explanations, making them unreliable and hard for humans to trust.

Method: Developed Skyra MLLM that identifies visual artifacts as evidence; created ViF-CoT-4K dataset with human annotations; used two-stage training to enhance spatio-temporal perception, explanation, and detection.

Result: Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks; ViF-Bench evaluation with 3K samples from 10+ video generators shows superior performance; provides valuable insights for explainable detection.

Conclusion: Skyra advances explainable AI-generated video detection by combining artifact identification with human-interpretable explanations, addressing reliability and trust issues in current methods.

Abstract: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

### [123] [VLIC: Vision-Language Models As Perceptual Judges for Human-Aligned Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15701)
*Kyle Sargent,Ruiqi Gao,Philipp Henzler,Charles Herrmann,Aleksander Holynski,Li Fei-Fei,Jiajun Wu,Jason Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLIC uses vision-language models to guide diffusion-based image compression with human-aligned preferences, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality without needing separate perceptual loss networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distortion metrics like MSE don't align well with human perception. While prior work uses perceptual losses trained on human judgments, this paper discovers that VLMs can replicate human binary preference judgments zero-shot, motivating their use for aligning compression models.

Method: VLIC is a diffusion-based image compression system that uses VLMs to provide binary preference judgments during post-training. Instead of distilling VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss, it directly uses VLM feedback to train the compression model via preference-based diffusion training techniques.

Result: The system achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned image compression across different datasets, as measured by perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. The paper also provides analysis of VLM reward design and training procedures.

Conclusion: VLMs can effectively guide image compression models toward human preferences without needing specialized perceptual loss networks, demonstrating the power of zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities for perceptual alignment tasks.

Abstract: Evaluations of image compression performance which include human preferences have generally found that naive distortion functions such as MSE are insufficiently aligned to human perception. In order to align compression models to human perception, prior work has employed differentiable perceptual losses consisting of neural networks calibrated on large-scale datasets of human psycho-visual judgments. We show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can replicate binary human two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) judgments zero-shot when asked to reason about the differences between pairs of images. Motivated to exploit the powerful zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we propose Vision-Language Models for Image Compression (VLIC), a diffusion-based image compression system designed to be post-trained with binary VLM judgments. VLIC leverages existing techniques for diffusion model post-training with preferences, rather than distilling the VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss network. We show that calibrating this system on VLM judgments produces competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression depending on the dataset, according to perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. We additionally conduct an extensive analysis of the VLM-based reward design and training procedure and share important insights. More visuals are available at https://kylesargent.github.io/vlic

### [124] [End-to-End Training for Autoregressive Video Diffusion via Self-Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15702)
*Yuwei Guo,Ceyuan Yang,Hao He,Yang Zhao,Meng Wei,Zhenheng Yang,Weilin Huang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Resampling Forcing enables training autoregressive video diffusion models from scratch without teacher models, using self-resampling to simulate inference errors and history routing for efficient long-horizon generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models suffer from exposure bias due to train-test mismatch. Existing solutions require bidirectional teacher models or online discriminators, lacking end-to-end training solutions.

Method: Introduces Resampling Forcing with self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time errors on history frames during training. Uses sparse causal mask for temporal causality with parallel training. Adds history routing mechanism for efficient long-horizon generation by dynamically retrieving top-k relevant history frames.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while showing superior temporal consistency on longer videos due to native-length training.

Conclusion: Resampling Forcing provides a teacher-free, end-to-end framework for training autoregressive video diffusion models from scratch at scale, addressing exposure bias and enabling efficient long-horizon generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.

### [125] [GateFusion: Hierarchical Gated Cross-Modal Fusion for Active Speaker Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15707)
*Yu Wang,Juhyung Ha,Frangil M. Ramirez,Yuchen Wang,David J. Crandall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GateFusion introduces a hierarchical gated fusion decoder with auxiliary objectives for active speaker detection, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Late fusion approaches in active speaker detection often fail to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions needed for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios.

Method: Combines pretrained unimodal encoders with Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate) for progressive multi-depth fusion, plus Masked Alignment Loss and Over-Positive Penalty auxiliary objectives.

Result: Achieves 77.8% mAP (+9.4%) on Ego4D-ASD, 86.1% mAP (+2.9%) on UniTalk, 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on WASD, and competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker.

Conclusion: GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results with strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of hierarchical fusion and auxiliary objectives.

Abstract: Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

### [126] [Multi-View Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15708)
*Leo Segre,Or Hirschorn,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes converting single-view foundation models into multi-view foundation models by adding 3D-aware attention layers to ensure consistent features across different views of the same 3D scene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models process each image independently, leading to inconsistent features for the same 3D point across different views. This inconsistency limits their effectiveness in multi-view scenarios.

Method: Augment Transformers-based foundation models (DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that match features across different views, bypassing the need for explicit 3D feature reconstruction.

Result: Quantitative experiments show significant improvement in feature matching compared to current foundation models, demonstrated through surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully converts single-view foundation models into multi-view versions that produce consistent features across different views, enabling direct manipulation in image space without explicit 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.

*Divam Gupta,Anuj Pahuja,Nemanja Bartolovic,Tomas Simon,Forrest Iandola,Giljoo Nam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPiCA is a photorealistic head avatar system that combines triangle meshes and 3D Gaussians for efficient mobile rendering while maintaining realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create photorealistic head avatars that can be efficiently rendered on mobile devices, overcoming the limitations of purely mesh-based or purely Gaussian-based approaches.

Method: Hybrid representation combining triangle mesh (for facial skin) and anisotropic 3D Gaussians (for hair/beard). Uses neural networks to decode facial expressions into mesh, texture, and Gaussians, with unified differentiable rendering pipeline.

Result: Achieves realism comparable to purely Gaussian-based avatars while matching the rendering performance of mesh-based avatars, enabling efficient mobile deployment.

Conclusion: GPiCA successfully combines the strengths of both mesh and Gaussian representations to create photorealistic avatars that are both realistic and efficient for mobile rendering.

Abstract: We present Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA), photorealistic head avatars that can be generated from multi-view images and efficiently rendered on mobile devices. GPiCA utilizes a unique hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh and anisotropic 3D Gaussians. This combination maximizes memory and rendering efficiency while maintaining a photorealistic appearance. The triangle mesh is highly efficient in representing surface areas like facial skin, while the 3D Gaussians effectively handle non-surface areas such as hair and beard. To this end, we develop a unified differentiable rendering pipeline that treats the mesh as a semi-transparent layer within the volumetric rendering paradigm of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We train neural networks to decode a facial expression code into three components: a 3D face mesh, an RGBA texture, and a set of 3D Gaussians. These components are rendered simultaneously in a unified rendering engine. The networks are trained using multi-view image supervision. Our results demonstrate that GPiCA achieves the realism of purely Gaussian-based avatars while matching the rendering performance of mesh-based avatars.

*Lunbin Zeng,Jingfeng Yao,Bencheng Liao,Hongyuan Tao,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionVL enables conversion of autoregressive vision-language models to diffusion paradigm with minimal fine-tuning, achieving performance gains and 2x inference speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise for multimodal tasks but current diffusion VLMs lag behind autoregressive models. The paper investigates whether powerful existing AR models can be converted to diffusion VLMs.

Method: Proposes DiffusionVL, a method to translate any powerful AR model into diffusion paradigm through simple fine-tuning. Introduces block-decoding design supporting arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse for inference speedup.

Result: Achieves 34.4% gain on MMMU-Pro (vision) and 37.5% gain on MME (Cog.) benchmarks with less than 5% of training data compared to prior methods. Also achieves 2x inference speedup.

Conclusion: Paradigm shift from AR to diffusion is effective and feasible, enabling competitive performance with LLaVA-style models while offering inference efficiency advantages.

Abstract: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

TL;DR: Pixio is an enhanced masked autoencoder that demonstrates autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today, achieving strong performance across diverse downstream tasks while being simple and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning (a classical paradigm) remains relevant and competitive with modern approaches, offering a simpler, more stable, and efficient alternative to latent-space methods.

Method: Enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and capable architectures, trained on 2B web-crawled images using self-curation with minimal human intervention.

Result: Pixio performs competitively across diverse downstream tasks including monocular depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, semantic segmentation, and robot learning, matching or outperforming DINOv3 trained at similar scales.

Conclusion: Pixel-space self-supervised learning via autoencoders is a promising alternative and complement to latent-space approaches, demonstrating continued relevance of classical paradigms in modern computer vision.

Abstract: At the most basic level, pixels are the source of the visual information through which we perceive the world. Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.

TL;DR: Spatia: A spatial memory-aware video generation framework that uses persistent 3D scene point clouds to maintain long-term spatial and temporal consistency in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the dense, high-dimensional nature of video signals. Current approaches lack mechanisms to preserve spatial coherence across generated frames over extended sequences.

Method: Proposes Spatia, which maintains a persistent 3D scene point cloud as spatial memory. The framework iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). This dynamic-static disentanglement design separates persistent scene geometry from dynamic entities.

Result: The approach enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the ability to produce realistic dynamic entities. It enables applications like explicit camera control and 3D-aware interactive editing.

Conclusion: Spatia provides a geometrically grounded framework for scalable, memory-driven video generation that addresses the fundamental consistency challenges in current video generation models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFEval++ to evaluate LLMs' nuance-oriented reliability - their ability to maintain consistent performance across subtly different prompts that convey the same user intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs achieve high scores on benchmarks like IFEval, but these scores don't translate to reliable real-world performance because users phrase instructions differently. The paper aims to study whether models maintain consistent competence across "cousin prompts" - prompts with subtle variations that convey the same intent.

Method: 1) Introduces a new metric called reliable@k to quantify nuance-oriented reliability. 2) Develops an automated pipeline for generating high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. 3) Builds IFEval++ benchmark for systematic evaluation. 4) Tests 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs.

Result: Current models show substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability - performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. The paper characterizes this issue and explores three potential improvement recipes.

Conclusion: Nuance-oriented reliability is a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior. The authors release their code and benchmark to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Advanced LLMs have achieved near-ceiling instruction-following accuracy on benchmarks such as IFEval. However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes. Our findings highlight nuance-oriented reliability as a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior.

TL;DR: Audio MultiChallenge is a new benchmark for evaluating end-to-end spoken dialogue systems on realistic multi-turn conversations, introducing voice editing challenges and audio-specific adaptations of existing text-based evaluation axes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for end-to-end spoken dialogue systems primarily use synthetic speech and single-turn tasks, failing to evaluate realistic multi-turn conversational abilities with natural speech patterns and disfluencies.

Method: Built on the text-based MultiChallenge framework, the benchmark introduces a new Voice Editing axis and adapts existing axes (Inference Memory, Instruction Retention, Self Coherence) to audio modality. It uses a hybrid audio-native agentic and human-in-the-loop pipeline to curate 452 conversations from 47 speakers with 1,712 instance-specific rubrics.

Result: Even frontier models struggle on the benchmark, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Thinking) achieving only 54.65% pass rate. Models fail most often on new axes, and Self Coherence degrades with longer audio context. Failures reflect difficulty tracking edits, audio cues, and long-range context in natural spoken dialogue.

Conclusion: Audio MultiChallenge provides a reproducible testbed to quantify the challenges of audio-native multi-turn interaction and drive improvements in spoken dialogue systems by exposing their limitations in handling natural speech patterns, disfluencies, and complex conversational dynamics.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems are increasingly replacing cascaded pipelines for voice-based human-AI interaction, processing raw audio directly without intermediate transcription. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these models on synthetic speech and single-turn tasks, leaving realistic multi-turn conversational ability underexplored. We introduce Audio MultiChallenge, an open-source benchmark to evaluate E2E spoken dialogue systems under natural multi-turn interaction patterns. Building on the text-based MultiChallenge framework, which evaluates Inference Memory, Instruction Retention, and Self Coherence, we introduce a new axis Voice Editing that tests robustness to mid-utterance speech repairs and backtracking. We further augment each axis to the audio modality, such as introducing Audio-Cue challenges for Inference Memory that require recalling ambient sounds and paralinguistic signals beyond semantic content. We curate 452 conversations from 47 speakers with 1,712 instance-specific rubrics through a hybrid audio-native agentic and human-in-the-loop pipeline that exposes model failures at scale while preserving natural disfluencies found in unscripted human speech. Our evaluation of proprietary and open-source models reveals that even frontier models struggle on our benchmark, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Thinking), our highest-performing model achieving a 54.65% pass rate. Error analysis shows that models fail most often on our new axes and that Self Coherence degrades with longer audio context. These failures reflect difficulty of tracking edits, audio cues, and long-range context in natural spoken dialogue. Audio MultiChallenge provides a reproducible testbed to quantify them and drive improvements in audio-native multi-turn interaction capability.

TL;DR: ICAR enables vision transformers to use adaptive computation based on image complexity - less compute for simple images, full compute for complex ones - while maintaining cross-modal alignment for retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision transformers use uniform computational effort for all images regardless of complexity, wasting resources on simple images while potentially underprocessing complex ones.

Method: Dual-path training to produce compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing, plus ConvNeXt-IC classifier for image complexity assessment to determine optimal compute allocation.

Result: Achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, with ConvNeXt-IC achieving 0.959 correlation with human judgement and 4.4x speedup.

Conclusion: ICAR enables sustainable scaling of vision-language systems by providing adaptive computation without compromising cross-modal alignment or requiring expensive reranking.

Abstract: Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural architecture search requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error. The authors aim to automate this process using LLMs to generate novel captioning architectures while reducing human effort.

Method: Uses DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B LLM to generate runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Implements prompt-based code generation with iterative fixes and automatic evaluation.

Found slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components (5 vs 10). LLM successfully proposed architectures, hyperparameters, and training practices.

Conclusion: LLM-guided NAS shows promise for automating architecture design. The pipeline successfully generates novel models and addresses challenges like code hallucinations through prompt rules and iterative fixes. Adds dozens of new captioning models to LEMUR dataset for reproducible benchmarking.

We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.

### [135] [SepsisSuite: Beyond Risk Stratification -- A Comparative Analysis of Deep Fusion vs. Expert Stacking for Prescriptive Sepsis AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14712)
*Ryan Cartularo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares two multimodal fusion approaches for sepsis prediction and antibiotic selection, finding that a Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts architecture outperforms a more complex attention-based model, achieving SOTA performance with 0.915 AUC for 4-hour prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, but conventional prediction models fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams (vitals, text, imaging), remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion.

Method: The paper compares two approaches: 1) SepsisFusionFormer (Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network) for end-to-end deep fusion, and 2) SepsisLateFusion (Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts) with three orthogonal modality experts ("Historian" for static data, "Monitor" for temporal data, "Reader" for NLP) dynamically gated via a CatBoost meta-learner.

Result: SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" and overfitting (AUC 0.66) on small antibiotic cohort. SepsisLateFusion achieved SOTA performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset, reducing missed cases by 48% after threshold calibration. For antibiotic selection, Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved 0.72 AUC.

Conclusion: A "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts architecture with modality-specific experts and dynamic gating outperforms complex attention-based fusion for sepsis prediction, enabling preventative intervention. The models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, yet conventional prediction models often fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams, remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion. In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the "Historian" (Static), the "Monitor" (Temporal), and the "Reader" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

*Zhengxu Yan,Han Li,Yuming Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops NoveltyRank, a model to estimate and rank conceptual novelty of AI papers using title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature, addressing the challenge of identifying truly innovative work in the flood of publications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in AI research publications makes it difficult for novel work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is unstable and time-consuming. There's a need for data-driven, scalable assessment of research originality.

Method: Two task formulations: (1) binary classification predicting absolute novelty from learned patterns, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison learning relative novelty. Fine-tunes Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1.

Result: Implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank. The paper analyzes how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance compared to GPT-5.1.

Conclusion: The system helps researchers identify genuinely innovative submissions and provides conference reviewers with quantitative, consistent novelty signals, enabling more efficient assessment of research originality in AI fields.

Abstract: With the growing ease of academic publishing, the volume of research papers, especially in AI-related fields, has surged dramatically. This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank.

### [137] [Task Matrices: Linear Maps for Cross-Model Finetuning Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14880)
*Darrin O' Brien,Dhikshith Gajulapalli,Eric Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "task matrices" - linear transformations that encode differences between base and finetuned models, showing they can approach finetuned performance across vision/text models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior work shows linear encodings exist in in-context prompting scenarios, it's unclear if similar linear representations exist in more general adaptation regimes like finetuning. The authors aim to demonstrate and characterize such linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned models.

Method: Developed the concept of a "task matrix" - a linear transformation that maps from base model embeddings to finetuned model embeddings. Applied this approach to both vision and text models across ten different datasets, comparing performance against linear probes and full finetuning.

Result: Task matrices achieve results surpassing linear probes and sometimes approach finetuned performance levels. The work validates existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures, and shows data-based approximations for such encodings are efficient and generalizable across domains.

Conclusion: Linear encodings exist between base and finetuned models, enabling efficient adaptation via task matrices that can approach finetuned performance while being more efficient and generalizable. Implementation is made publicly available.

Abstract: Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.

### [139] [DreamPRM-Code: Function-as-Step Process Reward Model with Label Correction for LLM Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15000)
*Ruiyi Zhang,Peijia Qin,Qi Cao,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DreamPRM-Code introduces a novel Process Reward Model for coding that treats functions as reasoning steps and uses meta-learning to correct noisy intermediate labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Process Reward Models (PRMs) for coding are limited due to lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and noise in Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels, preventing effective test-time scaling for LLMs.

Method: DreamPRM-Code uses Chain-of-Function prompting to induce modular code generation (treating functions as reasoning steps) and introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels with bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels.

Result: DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts PRM methodology to coding tasks by addressing decomposition and label noise challenges, demonstrating superior performance in test-time scaling for code generation.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

### [140] [The Semantic Illusion: Certified Limits of Embedding-Based Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15068)
*Debu Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAG systems still hallucinate despite evidence grounding. Conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees for detection, but embedding-based methods fail on real benchmarks due to "semantic illusion" - hallucinations preserve semantic similarity while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. GPT-4 as judge shows the task is solvable through reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods for RAG systems rely on semantic similarity and NLI, but their fundamental limitations haven't been rigorously characterized. There's a need for methods with statistical guarantees and better understanding of detection capabilities.

Method: Apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection to provide finite-sample coverage guarantees. Test on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions) and three real hallucination benchmarks (HaluEval, RAGTruth, WikiBio) across multiple LLMs. Compare embedding-based methods (including OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoders) with GPT-4 as an LLM judge.

Result: On synthetic data: 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate. On real benchmarks: embedding methods show unacceptable FPRs (100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, 50% on WikiBio). GPT-4 achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]), proving the task is solvable through reasoning. The "semantic illusion" phenomenon persists across architectures.

Conclusion: Embedding-based hallucination detection is fundamentally limited by "semantic illusion" where hallucinations preserve semantic similarity while introducing factual errors. This limitation persists across architectures, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment. Reasoning-based approaches like LLM judges show promise.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.

### [141] [From Isolation to Entanglement: When Do Interpretability Methods Identify and Disentangle Known Concepts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15134)
*Aaron Mueller,Andrew Lee,Shruti Joshi,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Dhanya Sridhar,Patrik Reizinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders and probes fail to produce truly disentangled concept representations despite appearing decorrelated; features affect multiple concepts when steered, showing independence metrics are insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods evaluate concept representations in isolation with implicit independence assumptions, but it's unclear if they actually recover disentangled representations when concepts are correlated in practice.

Method: Proposed multi-concept evaluation with controlled correlations between textual concepts (sentiment, domain, tense). Evaluated featurizers under increasing correlations, then performed steering experiments to test independent manipulability of concepts.

Result: Found one-to-many relationship: features correspond to at most one concept, but concepts distribute across many features. SAE features affect multiple concepts when steered, indicating neither selective nor independent representations, though features affect disjoint subspaces.

Conclusion: Correlational metrics for disentanglement are insufficient for establishing independence in steering, and affecting disjoint subspaces doesn't ensure concept selectivity. Highlights need for compositional evaluations in interpretability research.

Abstract: A central goal of interpretability is to recover representations of causally relevant concepts from the activations of neural networks. The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.

*Taichi Aida,Mamoru Komachi,Toshinobu Ogiso,Hiroya Takamura,Daichi Mochihashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes with Random Fourier Features to model and track temporal evolution of vector sets across domains like crime analysis and linguistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding temporal evolution of vector sets is fundamental across domains (ecology, crime analysis, linguistics), but challenging due to complex structures that evolve over time.

Method: Model distribution of each vector set using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes, approximate latent function with Random Fourier Features to obtain compact, comparable vector representations over time.

Result: Method successfully captures temporal dynamics in sociological (crime distributions) and linguistic (word embeddings) data, providing interpretable and robust representations.

Conclusion: Proposed approach offers a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains, enabling tracking and visualization of temporal transitions.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel AI framework combining LLMs and VLMs in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to automate incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting in abdominal CT scans, outperforming pure VLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of incidental findings in CT scans is time-consuming and variable. There's a need to improve efficiency and precision in detecting, classifying, and reporting these findings while following established medical guidelines.

Method: Plan-and-execute agentic framework using LLMs as planners that generate Python scripts with predefined base functions, and executors that run these scripts using VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines to automate incidental findings management.

Result: The framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency when tested on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs in a fully automatic end-to-end manner.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM+VLM agentic framework effectively automates incidental findings management in abdominal CT scans, demonstrating superior performance over pure vision-language approaches while maintaining guideline compliance.

Abstract: Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: SoFlow is a framework for one-step image generation that improves efficiency over multi-step diffusion models by using Flow Matching and solution consistency losses without requiring Jacobian-vector products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step denoising in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, motivating research on few-step generation to improve computational efficiency.

Method: Analyzes relationship between velocity function and solution function of velocity ODE; proposes Flow Matching loss and solution consistency loss; enables Classifier-Free Guidance during training; avoids Jacobian-vector product calculation.

Result: When trained from scratch using same DiT architecture and equal training epochs, SoFlow achieves better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

Conclusion: SoFlow provides an effective framework for one-step generation that outperforms existing methods while avoiding computational bottlenecks like Jacobian-vector products.

Abstract: The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

### [145] [HERO: Hierarchical Traversable 3D Scene Graphs for Embodied Navigation Among Movable Obstacles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15047)
*Yunheng Wang,Yixiao Feng,Yuetong Fang,Shuning Zhang,Tan Jing,Jian Li,Xiangrui Jiang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HERO is a framework for building hierarchical traversable 3D scene graphs that models operable obstacles as pathways, enabling more effective embodied navigation in obstructed environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Scene Graph approaches for embodied navigation rely on static-world assumptions, treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This severely limits reachability, efficiency, and extensibility in real-world scenarios where obstacles can be operated to create pathways.

Method: HERO constructs Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs that redefine traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways. It captures physical interactivity, functional semantics, and relational hierarchy of scenes, enabling agents to understand which obstacles can be operated to create navigation paths.

Result: HERO reduces path length (PL) by 35.1% in partially obstructed environments and increases success rate (SR) by 79.4% in fully obstructed environments compared to baselines, demonstrating substantially higher efficiency and reachability.

Conclusion: By moving beyond static-world assumptions and modeling operable obstacles as pathways, HERO enables more intelligent embodied navigation in complex real-world environments where agents can interact with obstacles to create traversable spaces.

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs) constitute a powerful representation of the physical world, distinguished by their abilities to explicitly model the complex spatial, semantic, and functional relationships between entities, rendering a foundational understanding that enables agents to interact intelligently with their environment and execute versatile behaviors. Embodied navigation, as a crucial component of such capabilities, leverages the compact and expressive nature of 3DSGs to enable long-horizon reasoning and planning in complex, large-scale environments. However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy. The results show that, relative to its baseline, HERO reduces PL by 35.1% in partially obstructed environments and increases SR by 79.4% in fully obstructed ones, demonstrating substantially higher efficiency and reachability.

TL;DR: BEV-Patch-PF: GPS-free geo-localization using particle filter with BEV and aerial feature matching for real-time robot navigation in off-road environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for GPS-free geo-localization systems that work in challenging off-road environments with dense canopy and shadows, where GPS signals are unreliable or unavailable for robot navigation.

Method: Integrates particle filter with learned bird's-eye-view (BEV) and aerial feature maps. Constructs BEV feature map from onboard RGB and depth images, crops patches from aerial feature maps for each particle pose hypothesis, and computes log-likelihood by matching BEV features to aerial patch features.

Result: Achieves 7.5x lower absolute trajectory error (ATE) on seen routes and 7.0x lower ATE on unseen routes compared to retrieval-based baseline. Maintains accuracy under dense canopy and shadow. Runs in real-time at 10 Hz on NVIDIA Tesla T4.

Conclusion: BEV-Patch-PF provides accurate, real-time GPS-free geo-localization suitable for practical robot deployment in challenging off-road environments, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: We propose BEV-Patch-PF, a GPS-free sequential geo-localization system that integrates a particle filter with learned bird's-eye-view (BEV) and aerial feature maps. From onboard RGB and depth images, we construct a BEV feature map. For each 3-DoF particle pose hypothesis, we crop the corresponding patch from an aerial feature map computed from a local aerial image queried around the approximate location. BEV-Patch-PF computes a per-particle log-likelihood by matching the BEV feature to the aerial patch feature. On two real-world off-road datasets, our method achieves 7.5x lower absolute trajectory error (ATE) on seen routes and 7.0x lower ATE on unseen routes than a retrieval-based baseline, while maintaining accuracy under dense canopy and shadow. The system runs in real time at 10 Hz on an NVIDIA Tesla T4, enabling practical robot deployment.

*Jörg Gamerdinger,Sven Teufel,Stephan Amann,Lukas Marc Listl,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a novel safety metric framework for evaluating perception systems in autonomous vehicles, focusing on object and lane detection safety rather than just traditional accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) only measure detection accuracy but don't consider safety-critical aspects. Systems with high traditional scores can still cause dangerous misdetections leading to severe accidents.

Method: Introduces a framework with: 1) lightweight object safety metric quantifying risk from object detection errors, 2) lane safety metric considering interdependence between object and lane detection tasks, and 3) combined safety score providing unified, interpretable safety performance measure.

Result: Using the DeepAccident dataset, the approach successfully identifies safety-critical perception errors that conventional metrics fail to capture, demonstrating the importance of safety-centric evaluation.

Conclusion: Safety-focused evaluation methods are crucial for perception systems in autonomous driving, as traditional accuracy metrics alone are insufficient for ensuring vehicle safety in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Extensive evaluation of perception systems is crucial for ensuring the safety of intelligent vehicles in complex driving scenarios. Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MiVLA is a vision-language-action model that uses human-robot mutual imitation pre-training to improve generalization across different camera views, appearances, and robot embodiments by leveraging behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLAs struggle with generalization due to mismatches in camera views, visual appearance, and embodiment morphologies when using abundant human videos and simulated robot data. There's a need to bridge the gap between human demonstrations and robot control while leveraging both data sources effectively.

Method: Uses kinematic rules with left/right hand coordinate systems for bidirectional alignment between human and robot action spaces. Trained through mutual imitation where the model forecasts behavior trajectories for one embodiment and imitates behaviors for another unseen embodiment, integrating real-world human data fidelity with simulated robot data diversity.

Result: MiVLA achieves 25% improvement over state-of-the-art VLAs (π₀, π₀.₅, H-RDT) in simulation and 14% improvement in real-world robot control tasks across three different robots (ARX, PiPer, and LocoMan).

Conclusion: Mutual imitation pre-training effectively bridges human and robot domains, creating a unified model with enhanced generalization capabilities for downstream robotic tasks by combining the strengths of both human demonstration data and simulated robot data.

Abstract: While leveraging abundant human videos and simulated robot data poses a scalable solution to the scarcity of real-world robot data, the generalization capability of existing vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains limited by mismatches in camera views, visual appearance, and embodiment morphologies. To overcome this limitation, we propose MiVLA, a generalizable VLA empowered by human-robot mutual imitation pre-training, which leverages inherent behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms to build a foundation of strong behavioral priors for both human actions and robotic control. Specifically, our method utilizes kinematic rules with left/right hand coordinate systems for bidirectional alignment between human and robot action spaces. Given human or simulated robot demonstrations, MiVLA is trained to forecast behavior trajectories for one embodiment, and imitate behaviors for another one unseen in the demonstration. Based on this mutual imitation, it integrates the behavioral fidelity of real-world human data with the manipulative diversity of simulated robot data into a unified model, thereby enhancing the generalization capability for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulation and real-world platforms with three robots (ARX, PiPer and LocoMan), demonstrate that MiVLA achieves strong improved generalization capability, outperforming state-of-the-art VLAs (e.g., $\boldsymbolπ_{0}$, $\boldsymbolπ_{0.5}$ and H-RDT) by 25% in simulation, and 14% in real-world robot control tasks.

TL;DR: Video-Action Model (VAM) uses pretrained video models to capture both semantics and physical dynamics, reducing robot data requirements by 10x compared to traditional vision-language-action models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs rely on disconnected static web data for semantic understanding but lack innate physical causality, requiring massive robot data collection to compensate for missing dynamics knowledge.

Method: Pairs pretrained Internet-scale video model with flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on latent representations, serving as Inverse Dynamics Model to generate robot actions from video-space action plans.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.

Conclusion: Video-based pretraining that jointly captures semantics and visual dynamics is more effective than vision-language-only approaches, isolating low-level control as the remaining task.

Abstract: Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A video preprocessing framework for machine vision tasks that saves over 15% bitrate compared to standard codecs by optimizing for machine perception rather than human visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video coding methods focus on minimizing distortion for human perception metrics, overlooking the specific needs of machine vision systems which have different requirements than human viewers.

Method: Proposes a neural preprocessor that retains crucial information for machine vision tasks, combined with a differentiable virtual codec for rate-distortion constraints during training. Uses standard codecs for testing to ensure real-world applicability.

Result: Extensive experiments on two typical downstream tasks with various backbone networks show the approach saves over 15% bitrate compared to using only standard codec anchor versions.

Conclusion: The proposed video preprocessing framework effectively boosts rate-accuracy performance for machine vision tasks and can be easily applied to real-world scenarios while maintaining compatibility with standard codecs.

Abstract: There has been a growing trend in compressing and transmitting videos from terminals for machine vision tasks. Nevertheless, most video coding optimization method focus on minimizing distortion according to human perceptual metrics, overlooking the heightened demands posed by machine vision systems. In this paper, we propose a video preprocessing framework tailored for machine vision tasks to address this challenge. The proposed method incorporates a neural preprocessor which retaining crucial information for subsequent tasks, resulting in the boosting of rate-accuracy performance. We further introduce a differentiable virtual codec to provide constraints on rate and distortion during the training stage. We directly apply widely used standard codecs for testing. Therefore, our solution can be easily applied to real-world scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments evaluating our compression method on two typical downstream tasks with various backbone networks. The experimental results indicate that our approach can save over 15% of bitrate compared to using only the standard codec anchor version.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MAD-NP is a self-supervised foundation model that learns resolution-invariant representations from whole-slide images by linking low-magnification context with aligned high-magnification detail through cross-scale distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods treat different magnification levels in whole-slide images as independent views, preventing models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes - a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows where pathologists frequently switch between magnifications.

Method: Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD) - a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns through cross-scale correspondence without annotations.

Result: A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space, with MAD-NP serving as a foundation model that enables consistent performance across different magnification levels without retraining.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space

TL;DR: AI model automates Fagotti score estimation from diagnostic laparoscopy videos for ovarian cancer surgical planning, achieving good performance in predicting surgical feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Fagotti score used to assess surgical resectability in advanced ovarian cancer is subjective and operator-dependent, limiting reproducibility and widespread adoption. There's a need for standardized, objective assessment.

Method: Retrospective collection of diagnostic laparoscopy videos with Fagotti score assessments. Manual annotation of relevant frames for anatomical structures and peritoneal carcinosis. Deep learning models trained to automatically identify relevant frames, segment structures and carcinosis, and predict video-level Fagotti score and surgical indication.

Result: Segmentation achieved Dice scores of 70±3% for anatomical structures and 56±3% for peritoneal carcinosis. Video-level anatomical station classification reached F1-scores of 74±3% and 73±4%, Fagotti score prediction showed normalized RMSE of 1.39±0.18 and 1.15±0.08, and surgical indication prediction achieved F1-scores of 80±8% and 80±2% in development (n=101) and test (n=50) datasets respectively.

Conclusion: First AI model to predict cytoreductive surgery feasibility by automated Fagotti score estimation from laparoscopy videos. Reproducible performance suggests AI can support surgeons through standardized tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making in advanced ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage with peritoneal carcinosis (PC). Fagotti score (FS) assessment at diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) guides treatment planning by estimating surgical resectability, but its subjective and operator-dependent nature limits reproducibility and widespread use. Videos of patients undergoing DL with concomitant FS assessments at a referral center were retrospectively collected and divided into a development dataset, for data annotation, AI training and evaluation, and an independent test dataset, for internal validation. In the development dataset, FS-relevant frames were manually annotated for anatomical structures and PC. Deep learning models were trained to automatically identify FS-relevant frames, segment structures and PC, and predict video-level FS and indication to surgery (ItS). AI performance was evaluated using Dice score for segmentation, F1-scores for anatomical stations (AS) and ItS prediction, and root mean square error (RMSE) for final FS estimation. In the development dataset, the segmentation model trained on 7,311 frames, achieved Dice scores of 70$\pm$3% for anatomical structures and 56$\pm$3% for PC. Video-level AS classification achieved F1-scores of 74$\pm$3% and 73$\pm$4%, FS prediction showed normalized RMSE values of 1.39$\pm$0.18 and 1.15$\pm$0.08, and ItS reached F1-scores of 80$\pm$8% and 80$\pm$2% in the development (n=101) and independent test datasets (n=50), respectively. This is the first AI model to predict the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery providing automated FS estimation from DL videos. Its reproducible and reliable performance across datasets suggests that AI can support surgeons through standardized intraoperative tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making in AOC.

*Nalini M. Singh,Tiffany Chien,Arthur R. C. McCray,Colin Ophus,Laura Waller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Direct atomic structure determination from electron tomography using Gaussian parameterization instead of intermediate volumetric reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical tomography algorithms use intermediate volumetric representations that require post-processing to extract atomic structures, which may be suboptimal and sensitive to imaging artifacts.

Method: Reformulate tomography as direct atomic structure recovery by parameterizing structures as collections of Gaussians with learnable positions and properties, incorporating physical priors.

Result: Improved robustness to real-world imaging artifacts demonstrated through simulated experiments and proof-of-concept experimental data validation.

Conclusion: The Gaussian parameterization approach shows practical potential for materials characterization with TEM, offering more direct and robust atomic structure determination.

Abstract: Atomic electron tomography (AET) enables the determination of 3D atomic structures by acquiring a sequence of 2D tomographic projection measurements of a particle and then computationally solving for its underlying 3D representation. Classical tomography algorithms solve for an intermediate volumetric representation that is post-processed into the atomic structure of interest. In this paper, we reformulate the tomographic inverse problem to solve directly for the locations and properties of individual atoms. We parameterize an atomic structure as a collection of Gaussians, whose positions and properties are learnable. This representation imparts a strong physical prior on the learned structure, which we show yields improved robustness to real-world imaging artifacts. Simulated experiments and a proof-of-concept result on experimentally-acquired data confirm our method's potential for practical applications in materials characterization and analysis with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

Motivation: Address the challenge of optic disc and optic cup segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images, overcoming data scarcity issues in medical imaging.

Method: Developed meta-learners with Omni meta-training that balances data usage and diversifies shot numbers, created efficient versions to reduce computational costs, and developed sparsification techniques for customizable scribbles and sparse labels.

Result: Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg) achieved IoU scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods. Best performance reached 86.80% for OD and 71.78% for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learners, particularly EO-ProtoSeg, provide effective few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, lightweight architecture (<2M parameters), and no retraining requirements.

Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.

Motivation: Existing compression preprocessing methods are predominantly Rate-Distortion optimized and constrained by pixel-level fidelity, lacking focus on perceptual quality. The paper pioneers a shift towards Rate-Perception optimization to enhance visual quality.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Distill Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a compact one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD); 2) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of attention modules guided by Rate-Perception loss and differentiable codec surrogate.

Result: Substantial Rate-Perception gains with up to 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS on Kodak dataset, delivering superior subjective visual quality. Method integrates seamlessly with standard codecs without modification.

Conclusion: Successfully adapts diffusion models for compression preprocessing with Rate-Perception optimization, leveraging generative priors to enhance texture and mitigate artifacts while maintaining compatibility with existing codecs.

Abstract: Preprocessing is a well-established technique for optimizing compression, yet existing methods are predominantly Rate-Distortion (R-D) optimized and constrained by pixel-level fidelity. This work pioneers a shift towards Rate-Perception (R-P) optimization by, for the first time, adapting a large-scale pre-trained diffusion model for compression preprocessing. We propose a two-stage framework: first, we distill the multi-step Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a compact, one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD). Second, we perform a parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the distilled model's attention modules, guided by a Rate-Perception loss and a differentiable codec surrogate. Our method seamlessly integrates with standard codecs without any modification and leverages the model's powerful generative priors to enhance texture and mitigate artifacts. Experiments show substantial R-P gains, achieving up to a 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS on the Kodak dataset and delivering superior subjective visual quality.

### [156] [Quantifying Return on Security Controls in LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15081)
*Richard Helder Moulton,Austin O'Brien,John D. Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Framework quantifies financial risk of LLM vulnerabilities and compares ROI of security controls using Monte Carlo simulations on a RAG system with synthetic PII.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which LLM security safeguards are worth deploying, needing financial risk estimates to make informed security investment decisions.

Method: Created RAG service with DeepSeek-R1 over synthetic PII corpus, attacked with Garak across 5 vulnerability classes. Used Laplace's Rule for success probabilities, Monte Carlo simulations with breach-cost data to generate loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Compared ABAC, NER redaction, and NeMo Guardrails against baseline.

Result: Baseline had ≥98% attack success rates for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection with $313k expected loss per scenario. ABAC reduced success to near zero, cut expected loss by 94% (RoC 9.83). NER eliminated PII leakage (RoC 5.97). NeMo Guardrails provided minimal benefit (RoC 0.05).

Conclusion: Decision framework enables monetary comparison of LLM security controls; ABAC and NER redaction provide substantial ROI while NeMo Guardrails offers little value for tested vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).

Motivation: Existing vision-language models lack specialized capabilities for financial visual understanding, particularly in handling complex reasoning chains that progress from basic perception to expert-level financial analysis.

Method: PyFi-adv: multi-agent adversarial mechanism using Monte Carlo Tree Search where challenger and solver agents compete to generate pyramid-structured question chains. PyFi-600K: 600K synthetic financial QA dataset organized in reasoning pyramid from basic perception to expert financial analysis.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL models on pyramid-structured question chains improved accuracy by 19.52% (3B) and 8.06% (7B). The framework enables hierarchical evaluation of VLMs in financial domain and complex question decomposition.

Conclusion: PyFi provides scalable, synthetic data generation and progressive reasoning framework that significantly enhances financial visual understanding capabilities of VLMs through pyramid-structured question chains.

Abstract: This paper proposes PyFi, a novel framework for pyramid-like financial image understanding that enables vision language models (VLMs) to reason through question chains in a progressive, simple-to-complex manner. At the core of PyFi is PyFi-600K, a dataset comprising 600K financial question-answer pairs organized into a reasoning pyramid: questions at the base require only basic perception, while those toward the apex demand increasing levels of capability in financial visual understanding and expertise. This data is scalable because it is synthesized without human annotations, using PyFi-adv, a multi-agent adversarial mechanism under the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm, in which, for each image, a challenger agent competes with a solver agent by generating question chains that progressively probe deeper capability levels in financial visual reasoning. Leveraging this dataset, we present fine-grained, hierarchical, and comprehensive evaluations of advanced VLMs in the financial domain. Moreover, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the pyramid-structured question chains enables these models to answer complex financial questions by decomposing them into sub-questions with gradually increasing reasoning demands, yielding average accuracy improvements of 19.52% and 8.06%, respectively, on the dataset.

Motivation: Online harassment research has focused on public social media platforms, leaving a gap in understanding and addressing harassment in private messaging platforms like Instagram.

Method: Used human labelers to identify harassment in Instagram messages, then developed an LLM pipeline for large-scale labeling using conversation context. Also used LLM to generate and evaluate simulated responses to harassment messages.

Result: LLM labeling pipeline successfully identifies online harassment in private messages. Simulated LLM-generated responses are superior in helpfulness compared to original human responses.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively detect online harassment in private messaging platforms and generate helpful responses, offering a scalable solution to address harassment in private digital spaces.

Abstract: Online harassment has been a persistent issue in the online space. Predominantly, research focused on online harassment in public social media platforms, while less is placed on private messaging platforms. To address online harassment on one private messaging platform, Instagram, we leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we recruited human labelers to identify online harassment in an Instagram messages dataset. Using the previous conversation as context, we utilize an LLM pipeline to conduct large-scale labeling on Instagram messages and evaluate its performance against human labels. Then, we use LLM to generate and evaluate simulated responses to online harassment messages. We find that the LLM labeling pipeline is capable of identifying online harassment in private messages. By comparing human responses and simulated responses, we also demonstrate that our simulated responses are superior in helpfulness compared to original human responses.

Method: Created SoMe benchmark with diverse social media agent tasks, large-scale data collection (9M+ posts, 6.5K+ user profiles), 17K+ annotated task queries, and agent tools for accessing/analyzing social media data from various platforms.

Result: Both closed-source and open-source LLMs perform unsatisfactorily on social media agent tasks, revealing significant limitations in handling realistic social media environments despite their impressive capabilities.

Conclusion: SoMe provides a challenging, realistic testbed for future social media agents and offers the first comprehensive insight into LLM agents' performance in social media contexts, highlighting areas needing improvement.

Abstract: Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities and gained increasing popularity on social media platforms. While LLM agents are reshaping the ecology of social media, there exists a current gap in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of their ability to comprehend media content, understand user behaviors, and make intricate decisions. To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily. SoMe provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future social media agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LivXue/SoMe

TL;DR: Analysis of multimodal scientific reasoning in LLMs using Korean CSAT Earth Science questions reveals critical cognitive limitations including perception-cognition gaps and calculation-conceptualization discrepancies, providing insights for designing AI-resistant assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As students increasingly use AI for assignments, concerns about academic integrity and assessment validity grow. This study aims to understand AI's cognitive limitations in scientific reasoning to help educators design assessments that can distinguish genuine student work from AI-generated responses.

Method: Used Earth Science I section of 2025 Korean CSAT to analyze multimodal reasoning in GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Designed three experimental conditions: full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input to evaluate performance across different data structures.

Result: Unstructured inputs caused significant performance degradation due to segmentation and OCR failures. Even under optimized conditions, models showed fundamental reasoning flaws: perception errors dominated, revealing a perception-cognition gap where models recognized visual data but failed to interpret symbolic meanings. Models also exhibited calculation-conceptualization discrepancy (performing calculations without understanding concepts) and process hallucination (skipping visual verification for unfounded background knowledge).

Conclusion: The study identifies specific cognitive vulnerabilities in LLMs that can be exploited to design "AI-resistant questions." By targeting perception-cognition gaps and other weaknesses, educators can create assessments that distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, ensuring assessment fairness in the age of generative AI.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

Motivation: Current context attribution methods for LLMs are incomplete because they only relate generated tokens directly to the prompt, ignoring how earlier generations influence later ones. This opacity in LLM reasoning raises safety and trust concerns that need better explanation methods.

Method: Introduces CAGE framework with attribution graphs - directed graphs that quantify how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graphs preserve causality and row stochasticity, allowing context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths.

Result: CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, achieving average gains of up to 40% compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CAGE provides more complete explanations for LLM behavior by capturing inter-generational influences through attribution graphs, addressing limitations of current context attribution methods and improving explanation faithfulness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

Motivation: Existing interpretability methods use hand-designed agents to hypothesize about activation-behavior relationships, which is difficult due to the complexity of activation space. The authors aim to create a more scalable, automated approach to interpreting internal neural network activations.

Method: Train interpretability assistants with an encoder-decoder architecture: an encoder compresses activations into a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list to answer natural language questions about model behavior. The system is pretrained on large unstructured data then finetuned for specific questions.

Result: PCDs show favorable scaling properties - concept interpretability improves with more data, as does downstream performance. The system successfully detects jailbreaks, secret hints, implanted latent concepts, and accurately surfaces latent user attributes.

Conclusion: Predictive Concept Decoders provide an effective end-to-end training approach for neural network interpretability that scales well with data and performs well on practical applications requiring understanding of internal model activations.

Abstract: Interpreting the internal activations of neural networks can produce more faithful explanations of their behavior, but is difficult due to the complex structure of activation space. Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes.
